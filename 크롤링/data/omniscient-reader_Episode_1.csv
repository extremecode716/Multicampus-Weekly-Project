1,"Oct 28, 2020","As a person who started reading this webtoon, binged all 551 chapters of the webnovel in a week, and is now returning to webtoon, I believe this is absolutely epic. [Great Fable, ""Omniscient Reader"" has begun its storytelling!]"
1,"Aug 21, 2020",What the heck im in the subway when I opened the webtoon and this suddenly got recommended to me. üëÄ 
1,"Dec 21, 2020","In my opinion, this is better than Solo Levelling"
1,"Aug 19, 2020",im getting solo leveling vibes 
1,"Mar 12, 2021","Hi. I am a reader of omniscient reader living in Korea.
There are a lot of great things about this work, but I'll talk a little bit for those of you who read it early.

Because of the pronunciation of Chinese and Korean, kimdokja has a triple meaning.

dokja indirectly expresses the person who has read the novel and the person who leads it in a word as a reader and a leader.

In the last Korean and Chinese characters, dokja means a lonely person.

I will only explain it so far. Please try it."
1,"Mar 18, 2021","A masterpiece. I have read almost till the end of the web novel, and I came here to write this comment. Couldn't have described how much emotion this story brought for me. Mad respect for Sing Shong-nim <3"

1,"Aug 11, 2021",I recently finished the novel for omniscient reader and it's a new favorite of mine. if you are considering reading this webtoon I highly recommend it! and if you like it enough to switch to the novel as well. they're both really good and I cant wait until the webtoon gets to some of my favorite arcs! love you kdj you foolish man

1,"Apr 27, 2021",moral of the story: FINISH EVERY NOVEL YOU STARTED READING
1,"Jan 25, 2021",guys i don't recommend you to read every comments (specially the newest) 'cause this webtoon is based on a novel which already reach the end. So there could be people spoiling the end or the next episode.

1,"Oct 16, 2021",Rereading it coz why not 
1,"Oct 15, 2021",I think it's because he finished the last episode everything was triggered. I feel like this was the author of the book he was reading was the one who planned it all to be like that

I just binge read 1875 chapters of Reverend Insanity in 2 weeks and that was a novel, webnovels are easier/faster to read aswell. The only way I think it took him so much time is the webnovel only released 1 chapter per day? So 365 days √ó 10 i.e 3650 chapters~. Well, skip Saturdays and Sundays I guess so around 3150. Noice"
1,"Aug 24, 2020",*looks at my horror web novels with suspicion*

1,"Aug 22, 2020",Y‚Äôall if you‚Äôve read solo leveling then you might recognize the art Style but no it is not the same author but the same studio
1,"Aug 21, 2020","Sees a hot man.*hipity hopity hop, u are now in my list „ÉΩ(¬¥‚ñΩ`)/"
1,"Aug 21, 2020","Based on my observation I think his future self wrote the webnovel, hence the 1 viewer who was the main protagonist. he is the only one who knows how to survive because he was the one who wrote about it. and as soon as he finished the apocalypse began. I'm new;-; so I might be wrong"
1,"Aug 21, 2020",I'll support it by officially reading all the releases here.....
1,"Aug 21, 2020",What is this.... Solo Reading? XD
1,"Aug 21, 2020",Glad it's on an official app. I hope it get caught up soonl. I'm still at chapter 356 of it's novel.üòä
1,"Aug 21, 2020","It looks sick and familiar to Solo leveling art style. I'll say some panels are more beautiful than the SL. I already have high hopes. Really wish webtoon add Solo leveling too. So, that I can support it fairly. This studio really has some good artists with them"
1,"Aug 21, 2020",And also the dedication of the author who continued to write what only one person ever reads.
1,"Aug 21, 2020","Umm well ,what about the person who wrote the thing? Like even if he is the only reader ,there would be at least two people who would know."
1,"Aug 21, 2020",the art is amazing  keep on going
1,"Aug 21, 2020",This is going to be a fantastic series
1,"Aug 21, 2020",Is this a God-tier Webtoon!? I'M IN!!!! 
1,"Aug 21, 2020",Am I the only one who is thinking this weebtoon just look like other one (solo leveling)?  
1,"Aug 21, 2020","The first thing that came to my mind as I was reading was ""sexy""!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Aug 20, 2020","This brought back so many memories....one of the few,very few novels that made me cry... I am happy that I can live through his adventure once more even though I know how it's gonna be"
1,"Aug 20, 2020",Also dont compare this to solo leveling (the art maybe really similar coz they're obviously from the same studio) but the storys no way for solo leveling to reach. Kinda dissapointed how solo leveling surpassed this novel I hate shonen fanboys now
1,"Aug 20, 2020","3,149 episodes in ten years? HA FILTHY PEASANT! I would have finished it in a month"
1,"Aug 20, 2020",respect to the webnovel author who kept updating for 10 years even though only one person was reading it 
1,"Aug 20, 2020","""Who would bother reading a webnovel with 3000 episodes anyway?""Me: *nervously looks at stack of books I read and the ton of webcomics I read*"
1,"Aug 20, 2020",It‚Äôs like solo leveling

1,"Aug 20, 2020",Just wait till this reaches 3000 episodes... just wait...
1,"Aug 20, 2020","not a person who normally reads action webtoons, but he‚Äôs hot"
1,"Aug 20, 2020","Okay, so ten years (10‚Ä¢365) equals 3,650 days. If there are 3,149 episodes, that means less then an episode a day, WHO READS LESS THAN AN EPISODE A DAY!!!! (Okay, I just had a thought, it probably is updating as he goes which would explain why it took so long for him to read it, but still, new readers could catch up relatively fast)"
1,"Aug 20, 2020","Oooohh it‚Äôs on WEBTOON now!!! I absolutely love the novel üòÜüòÜ tho... u know if u go onto the internet there‚Äôs acc more eps of the comic (ye ye ik it‚Äôs a pirate site but idrm) On another note, I‚Äôm glad it got picked up so to all the new readers, you‚Äôre in for a ride full of twists and turns and eventually... a wholesome and fulfilling finished story üòÜüòÜ!!!"
1,"Aug 20, 2020","Imagine telling a story to only one reader, spending hours to create it and all... That's some dedication there."

1,"Aug 26, 2020",What‚Äôs funny is how webnovel stole the license from another free-lance translator. I remember him saying that he lost the lawsuit and they stole the rights from him. He had already translated over 100 chapters too. üò¢

1,"Aug 26, 2020","took him ten years to read something with 3000 episodes? How slow does he read? Am I really that much faster a reader than average? I could easily read all of ""Sweet Home"" in a day (and I did), and thats about 130 chapters. With plenty of time to spare. With that in mind, reading 1400 chapters would take me 2 weeks, reading all 3000 chapters would take me about a bit over a month, tops. A freaking decade my dude? Its long af, but not that long!"
1,"Aug 26, 2020",Who is only reading this for the coins
1,"Aug 26, 2020",I'll finish 3000 chapters in at least three weeks(i have a reading addiction)
1,"Aug 26, 2020","Ok. At first I was on the fence with this one, since Webtoon is having a give away ( the read stories get coins thing) so I decided to give this a go, getting some free coins on the way, *click chapter 0* get blown away by the art. So in conclusion, this Webtoon will give me insomnia, and I love it."

Also, really cool concept. Is he the mc to the webtoon he‚Äôs been reading. Also, maybe the author of that webtoon was so frustrated they couldn‚Äôt get more than 1 viewer so they decided to just make it real so everyone could experience the masterpiece."
1,"Aug 24, 2020",bro this is on par with solo leveling 
1,"Aug 24, 2020","The concept and idea of Omniscient Reader is something that I find is rare in many literature. The fact that the MC,the ONLY person, has read that Web Novel and is the ONLY person who has an idea of how take on this new threat"

Honestly I thought it said three years when I first wrote this‚Ä¶ HOW DID IT TAKE HIM TEN YEARS I COULD DO IT IN 3 MONTHS
1,"Sep 20, 2021","It seriously took him ten years to read something that was already completed, I'd understand if he had to wait on chapters but that's a long time for something that was done but didn't have anyone reading it. At most it should've taken a year."
1,"Aug 11, 2021",These must be the same people who did the art for Solo Leveling.
1,"Aug 10, 2021",I'M HYPED FOR THIS ONE

1,"Sep 5, 2022","3000 episodes over 10 years means 300 episodes a year means about an episode a day....why'd it take him so long? I can read 5 a day easy and more on the weekends. hmmmm. ok, at 5 eps a day for every day you'd finish in 2 years. maybe it only released an episode a day?"

1,"Jul 5, 2022","My only critique so far is that the writer conveyed his ""hobby"" in a weird way. Like, so is ""reading webnovels on a train"" specifically his hobby then? I don't think so as we're shown that he clearly has read webnovels in other places in the past. I know it's a weird critique in itself but wording is important when telling a story and here it was worded just... in a weird way, that's all."

Also, I find it weird how he didn't mention the obvious 1.9 average view count for the novel and it means that someone other than him has read 9/10 of the novel, but all he showed was episodes he read because he farther ahead of the other guy and they only have 1 view a episode."
1,"Feb 21, 2022",good for him for commenting on every episode he read that's love and appreciation right there <3

1,"Aug 19, 2020",So I‚Äôm thinking the person who wrote the novel was part of the plan to end the world or atleast knew about it & was hoping others would catch on by writing the web novel? Interesting story so far & amazing art üëåüèæ

1,"Aug 19, 2020",Quality art style. Promising plot.
1,"Aug 19, 2020","Really good premise, but the idea that only one person read the series is a bit much. If he had friends surely he would have suggested it to them. If I find a great new series, especially one with little to no following, the first thing I do is try to share it with others who might love the series too. Hopefully the series addresses this."
1,"Aug 19, 2020",is it only me or did anyone else also at some point imagined to enter into a webseries while reading it!!
1,"Aug 19, 2020","welp, 18 ep right now. maybe should read those unofficially chapters first before asking for coin"
1,"Aug 19, 2020","at last, it now in webtoon .....huhutq very much"
1,"Aug 19, 2020","the art is so captivating! can't wait to read all of this! i haven't read the novel but if the ""ride"" everyone's been saying is similar to or greater than Noblesse's then I'd gladly give this webtoon all my money!"
1,"Aug 19, 2020",this series is only about 18 ep right now in waiting till more
1,"Aug 19, 2020",hype mode activated
1,"Aug 19, 2020",first person apocalyptic story like I dont already live in the south during a pandemic üôÑ
1,"Aug 19, 2020","Wait, does this mean that the this series will be 3000  episodes too???? üò•üò•üò•"
1,"Aug 19, 2020",My first thought is shouldn‚Äôt whoever wrote the web novel also know how the world ends and the story goes. Unless through some weird time travel dimensional etc something he is the author.  Hmmm...
1,"Aug 19, 2020",KIM DOKJA I LOVE YOU

1,"Aug 19, 2020","I was like ""wow the art is soooooo amazing! it's just like solo leveling!"" until someone pointed out that it's the same artist as solo leveling"
1,"Aug 19, 2020","so the mc raises a good point. why didn't anyone else read it? even if it is 3000 episodes/chapters I imagine it would have more of a following, especially if it was uploaded regularly. personally I love finding series to binge read."

Yoo Sangah: I think it‚Äôs speaking Spanish....should I talk to it? Dokja: NO! What are you gonna do huh? Ask it for money? S. A. V. A. G. E."

1,"Aug 20, 2020","The webnovel started out great. I was really invested in it for a while. However, at some point, it becomes far too drawn out and the storyline takes a meandering tone. Overall, the first part was extremely enjoyable but it had the same fate most other korean webnovels. Also, webnovel recommendations: Dominion‚Äôs End, m Grandmaster of demonic cultivation, Trash of the count‚Äôs family. Those are my top 3 faves."
1,"Aug 19, 2020","I just gotta say, as someone who read this on reaper scans, y'all are in for one hell of a ride."
1,"Aug 19, 2020",I don't think I have gotten this excited to start reading a new series since Solo Leveling. Freaking out with excitement!!!
1,"Mar 23, 2021",Its just like solo leveling OMG so excited
1,"Jan 15, 2021","is he just a slow reader? i could read over 3000 chapters without a problem within a week, i read tower of god by SIU in a day, which has around 500 ish chapters, lmfao. maybe i just read reallllly fast-"
1,"Dec 9, 2020",Solo Leveling plz
1,"Nov 1, 2020",uma s√©rie que promete muito! super empolgada para ver como vai ser desenrolada a trama! ‚ù§Ô∏è
1,"Oct 20, 2020","It took me 10 years to read 3k episodes...Pshhh yeah I've never read 500 episodes in a week, that would be weird."
1,"Oct 19, 2020","3k episode for 10 years??? Nadah, I can finish that with just 1 month or even weeks hahahaha"
1,"Aug 24, 2020",yo deadass. the art style is similar to solo leveling. is the author the same üò≤
1,"Aug 23, 2020",ok but i would finish a 3000 episode comic in 30 days.... it takes me like 2 days to read 200 episodes :/
1,"Aug 21, 2020",Any ARMY here cuz tomorrow dynamite will be released and I'm fuckin dying 
1,"Aug 19, 2020","How is it possible to only get one view one comment per episode? Unless the author and the reader are the only ones who can see it online, it's not very believable (Don't spoil anything if I'm somehow guessing correctly, please, this is my first reading of this). And if it was good enough to keep his interest for 10 years, he has been a bad fan if he didn't even entice his friends to read it too."
1,"Aug 19, 2020",art style reminds me of solo leveling. its awesome.
1,"Mar 31, 2021",3000 episodes in 10 years? P a t h e t i c

1,"Aug 25, 2020","I saw the cover of this episode and thought ""SOLO LEVELING, LETS GOO"" and just kept pressing without reading what I was clicking. I really like this too though, dis amazing :0"

1,"Aug 19, 2020",Just wondering dose this coming have anything to do with ‚Äúsolo leveling‚Äù because the characters are basically the same. A yo what‚Äôs the 2 üëéüèª for??
1,"Oct 14, 2020","ten years to read 3K chapters? noob, it took me less than ten days to read all 400+ chapters of Tower of god and all of Nobless (witch is 543 + QandA's and other special chapters and the Epilogue. . .) I know, I have no life but I don't care."
1,"Apr 10, 2021",3149 in ten years?!? I could‚Äôve done that in 2 weeks max (only if it was all already released) Edit: maybe more like a month actually
1,"Oct 18, 2020","one request from here, please don't make it a webtoon of 3000 episodes!! ü§ß"
1,"May 7, 2021","Oh? 3000 eps? I can read 100+ Medium size book pages/hour. Pretty sure I can read 3000 eps in 1 month. Edit: Yeah, sorry guys I didn‚Äôt thought about that"

1,"Aug 21, 2020",Where can I read solo levelling üò≠üò≠üò≠
1,"Aug 19, 2020",Finally a webtoon that looks worth reading. I hope many big youTubers know about this I hear it's the same studio for solo leveling which already has high expectations for me and the plot seems really interesting that I wish there was more chapters out instead of 3. Well there's always the light novel
1,"Aug 2, 2021",ngl i dropped the series at first. but i had to come back for some more Gilyoung and Dokja moments. best father and son duo aside from Gojo and yuuji lol
1,"Jul 25, 2021",This gives me rise of the shield hero vibes

1,"Aug 29, 2020",I'm confused cause I've been reading this on manga dex for a while and it's further along not by much though so y would I pay for fast pass on this? 
1,"Aug 24, 2020",bts' new full english song 'dynamite' out now https://youtu.be/gdZLi9oWNZg
1,"Aug 24, 2020",Ha the premise of no one being willing to read a novel that‚Äôs over 3000 chapters is flawed (anyone here read Martial God Asura?) seems like a good story though 
1,"Aug 21, 2020",gosh they just added this there is already 30 chapters English on other sites and they even telling us to pay for upcoming chapters 
1,"Aug 20, 2020",there 18 chapters out guys go to mangatx.com

1,"Jul 25, 2021",reminds me of one piece
1,"Apr 13, 2021",Does it have a romance???? 
1,"Aug 20, 2020","I got cringe when people comparing solo leveling to this webtoon (similar art coz they're from the same studio, but orvs way superior than solo mediocre leveling in terms of ""Story"")"
1,"Mar 22, 2022","i got a bonner while watching the girls in my apartment ;) *_* $_$ ,*_*,"
1,"May 16, 2021",yo... 10 years? bUDDY I DID THE MATH - THAT'S LESS THAN 1 EPISODE PER DAY EITHER THE EPISODES ARE INSANELY LONG OR UR W E A K
1,"Aug 21, 2020",That‚Äôs not her name. It‚Äôs supposed to be Yoo Sangah. This is why I didn‚Äôt want KJJscans to let you guys work on this masterpiece instead of themselves.

1,"Aug 27, 2020","just a warning: prepare yourself for blood splatters and exploding heads in the next few chapters. I like the plot a lot, but I despise graphic violence. Someone is probably going to comment how 'it's not even that bad' because they've been desensitized by worse already, but I honestly feel sick. Especially ""Rotten"" do NOT read that one, disgusting. Not even worth the free coins. I'm off to cleanse my mind with cartoons or something cute and childish. Have a peaceful day‚úå"

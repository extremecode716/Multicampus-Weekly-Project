One of the best things is that the MC won’t be in a romantic relationship, so the shippers can go crazy. But, not having romance also is one of the best thing about it.

There's a reason why this is the most popular webnovel in South Korea. 
The MC is not an OP character but he's clever and way more charismatic. He's also a strategist using the knowledge he knows in the novel. He's not an emotionless robot or a killing machine. 
Side characters are not just there to be amazed by the MC, they're actually strong too on their own. They are lovable. 
There is no plot armor (you know what that means)....character deaths. 
The plot might be about survival and you think it's the same for many others. No it's not. You would be surprised. 
So stop comparing this to a power fantasy like Solo Levelling. As much as I love that manga because who hates an OP MC honestly? This far surpasses Solo Levelling because everyone has a mystery.

Just finished reading the webnovel and I must say ORV was the best novel I've ever read in my whole life. I felt so empty alr and I don't usually reread a story but now I'd like to read it again. ORV made me appreciate reading a story to know diff POVs of the characters. I can't wait to read the upcoming chapters in webtoon too ️

This is actually a pretty well written story so far. You can't really predict what is going to happen next. The MC is not exactly the MC of this story, which will make you think what the hell is going on here and trust me when i say this, they actually make this dynamic work. Excited to see how this story goes.

THIS IS A MUST TO READ
This is one of the biggest fantasy novels in Korea, it's very famous. I promise you it's worth reading. These are web novels I really enjoyed reading:

-Omniscent reader
-S classes that I raised
-Trash of the count family
-Solo Leveling

The first 3 are REALLY famous, I mean EXTREMELY famous. Those 3 are considered the BIG 3 within the fantasy/action web novels. Solo leveling was known quite well by people but not as much as the other 3, but it got famous after the webtoon got released because the quality of the webtoon was amazing! Anyways, out of the BIG 3, 'Omniscient reader' and 'Trash of the count family' got a webtoon released but 'S classes that I raised' is the only one that does not have a webtoon adaptation...but I hope they'll release one soon!

I like it bc the main protagonist isn’t your typical one, he knows how to take advantage of people and isn’t the kind-hearted one you would expect. He’s not evil either. He isn’t OP but he can still get the job done using his abilities and allys he has by his side

I have read Solo Leveling, and many  adventure webtoon. However,  I must say Omniscient Reader is my favorite one. It gave me great feeling, so much emotion happy and sad, love and hates, rather than just fight and fight. I also love the development of support characters.  And, the best part is the chemistry between Kim Dokja and Yoo Jong Huyk haha

Oh god I just feel bad for the people who can’t see the actual novel!! I shouldn’t compare works but honestly this is the best novel I’ve read since Harry Potter. It really feels like there’s a person named Dokja out there. How the authors(the novel writers Shing and Shong) carry out the plot is amazing!! It’s not just the plot, how they describe the scenes and the raw emotions, is beyond art. Believe me, it’s the best thing I’ve read so far and the webtoon is good too.

I already finished reading the whole 551 webnovel chapters. What a ride.
There were some points where I thought ""this is getting repetitive that it's cliche/ cheesy/ cringe"" and I considered to drop it, several times.
But I continue reading, just like how Kim Dokja faithfully reads Ways of Survival, and I gradually fell in love with it. The unique plot, the characters, I love how well written they are.
Also the ending really got my heart, a very proper one imo.
Definitely recommend it to anyone who read this comment.
Yes, to you the Reader, just as I am a Reader too

Man. I read the novel a way back since it came out and I was mind blown by how good it was.  NOW we get the comic version. The comic does justice to the novel although some parts are missing because the novel itself has a lot of exposition but they make it up with the art. LIKE THE BACKGROUND IS REALLY IMPORTANT. Like the background of the art comes back as really important stuff. Definitely a new experience just like it was meant to be. I am happy for the comic version.

I've followed the novel. This was perhaps one of the greatest novels I've read. Of course, the protagonist is a cheat in his own way but the world still would kick him down any time he pushes past his boundaries. There were tons of character developments. The worldbuilding was phenomenal. There's really nothing much you can ask of it. Maybe if it had been longer, I guess? Have fun with the webtoon version, read it to the end, you won't regret it.

I recently finished this novel and I have never in my life read anything better. I stayed awake until 3 am crying over the ending. It has left me feeling so many emotions but at the same time so empty. This was the greatest read ever. I highly highly recommend it to anyone. Towards the end when everything gets revelaed, your mind will truly be blown. I will never forget this. I miss Dokja already. So much, and the rest too.

The novel is a masterpiece. Webtoon had just came out a month or so ago, and I’m here anticipating for an anime to be made. I very much expected there to be one after the Webtoon. But I know making Webtoon and animes are hard work, so I will wait patiently.

Edit:
Actually, now that they had decided to have Omniscient Reader, will they also translate the manhua/webtoon for The Trash of the Count’s Family? I really hope they do.  I know that there’s a Korean manhua/webtoon, but I don’t know Korean...I hope they will have it on Webtoon. But then, the novel is incomplete right now, and I think Webtoon only picks up completed novels? 
Okay, I’m just going to wait and hope.

one of the best thing about this novel is that it indicates this story being passed to sing N song (the real author of this webtoon) by the op of this story which actually leaves you in the edge with this strong feeling of the apocalypse being real, that this whole webtoon is a real happening and one of us could be mc's reincarnation

Didn't look into this for a while bc I usually hate isekai stuff, but after starting the webtoon I was hooked. Ended up reading the webnovel too, now I'm already 300 chapters in and it's only been three days. It's really well written and nearly every character gets their own development, the worldbuilding is amazing and the story development is well paced and interesting! The relationships between the characters feel very genuine and well built, it doesn't feel cheap at all. The story itself feels so immersive. It's genuinely one of the easiest thing to get into for me, it's been a while since I've been this hooked by a story.

Omnisient Reader is very different from some other manhwas or novels like every boys admire mc and every girls fall in love to mc. Every side characters have their own story and own development. 
Their are many genres in this story... fantasy, apocalypes, comedy, survival, tragedy, action and even little bromance just for humor. Omnisient Reader's mc is not overpowered character. His only adventage is that he knows all the original story. So he has to solve the difficult situation just with his knowledge. However, he tries to change the story since the original story is full of tragedy and failness. And this makes really interesting story. 
I highly recommand to read this, both the webtoon and the novel. It's plot is awesome and all characters are great. The novel's English translation is quite awful... but it's okay to read it.

[It was also my first webnovel, so its really special for me.]

The story plot is very different from the normal 'MC read the novel and becomes OP' trope. 
The way the mysteries of the many characters converge into a single twist is absolutely genius.

Honestly it's a damn good webtoon like seriously it has such an intricate plot so guys please stop comparing this to manhwas like solo leveling. Although i don't hate solo leveling it has a simple storyline but the thing is the side characters get overlooked a lot and the existence of gods and monsters and other worlds felt shoehorned and that makes up for an unsatisfying ending. while on the other hand omniscient reader has a complex story amazing character development and main character kim dokja doesn't punch his way out of every situation like sun jinwoo .No Dokja uses his knowledge of this new world, he makes use of his party members , he always has a plan and that's the thing like about him the most . honestly this webtoon deserves more attention. now again that said i am not in any way saying that solo leveling is inferior to orv. i have read solo leveling believe me it was a very entertaining read but what orv does is it takes some of the elements from SL, fills in the stuff that SL was missing and makes it much enjoyable. would recommend 10/10

Just a heads up!
For those of you interested in reading the novel, please give it a try as well! It's really good, and it was one of the first novels that got me into light novels in the first place! The novel was just recently completed too, so you can go ahead and binge read it as well. There is A LOT of world and character building, and watching Yoo Jonghyuk's and Dokja's relationship development (as well as character, though I'd prefer not to spoil it) is going to be a nice treat! For those of you interested in isekai genres, don't mind an OP protagonist, or prefer a protagonist that's down to earth, I highly recommend this, Trash of the Count's Family (an on-going fantasy novel with lots of world building and character dynamics) and the S-classes I raised (which has a similar yet different concept compared to ORV, with a protagonist that's trying to save his little brother). These are the novels I started with, and it's also what got me into light novels in the first place! Please have a look at them!

I found out about the novel because of the webtoon. I thought it was gonna be just another no brainer read to pass boredom and I couldn't fathom why 551 chapters long?!...

200 chapters in and I was still invested.
300 chapters in and I WAS CRYING.
400 chapters in and I'M FREAKING WAILING.

A MUST read with a steady plot, great plot twists and very loveable and round characters. I'm so excited for the webtoon!!

I just finished the novel last night and I was beyond speechless. First, the ending. I don't know how to say it but it's satisfying not (you know what I mean?) *I highly recommend you (whoever read this comment) to binge and read the novel and manhwa.. I don't want to put some spoilers in this so just read it.

Second is the characters.. they were well-made. Periodt.(I mean, do I need to explain it? Just read it!) Third is the FCKING TWISTS that got me utterly speechless. From HSY being the _ and YJH being the _ and of course KDJ being the ___. Heh.





Man. What a journey

I had read the manhwa first before finishing the novel... And goddamn orv manhwa now feels way different after all those chapters of the novel.  My perception of the manhwa as i was reading it for the first time was how refreshing it was and plot is packed af. Now i've finished the novel, manhwa's atmosphere became heavy. It's not like the manhwa failed to capture the angst of the novel, it was my expectations who failed me for not noticing the angst beforehand lol

This novel is completely different from the rest, it is truly a whole new level of novel.  In the novel is full of elements and believe me, you won't be able to guess what will happen next.

I love how the true substance of this story isn't something like wish fulfillment OP MC with corny romance and power fantasy hype despite being under the system/apocalypse theme.

The story is incredible albeit painfully slow burn and there's no telling what happens.
The charm doesn't only stick and revolve around the MC and the side characters don't feel one-dimensional and actually progresses on and off screen. There's no pandering or delay in each chapter and story progression is real here. Every mystery is unfolded throughout the story and plot holes are properly concluded. 

I truly appreciate plot-centric stories like this, literal gold.

I dont really read novel, specially Korean ones. But I Must say, ORV is an Amazing, well-Created Story. From all the Mangas or Novel I have read, never I feel so confused with the plot and stuff, Yet feeling hungry to know what happens next and keep reading as if its something that must be read. The ending was unexpected for me, even tho a friend of mine who introduce me to it has giving a few big spoilers(whcih I asked them to, since I need spoiler to keep reading), I never seen a Novel/Manga with an ending like that, an Ending that makes you feel as if you are the ""???"" Of the story..

Though I thought this story would be 3rd person breaking the 4th wall by the first chapter, (it isn’t that Btw), but it is still a very good read. 
It gives me no game no life, hunger games, and (the concept of what sao was supposeD to be) vibes, possibly combating Nier Automata with the main characters knowledge and internal to external conflict. 
I’m glad I’m starting to find some good novels to read and look forward to through these trying times!

Omniscient Readers is amazing (Currently on Chapter 384)
But I would love it if someone made this a game just imagine.
Playing Scenarios with your friends and getting skills and weapons.
Having Open World and maybe even a plaza once you reach a certain scenario.
Gaining stories from online event scenarios and using them to boost your attributes and play style.
Deciding your play style ex.
Swordmaster-More sword skills and a boost to sword skills and attributes
 Prophet-Able to see someone skills and attributes during battles, and a skill to dodge an attack.
Monster-
Archer-
Healer-
Tanker-
Monster Tamer-
etc.
Grind to become a constellation, Demon King, Outer God, or Archangel. (kinda like the legend grind in 2k.) By obtaining high-level stories and participating in events.
Traveling to different worlds and exploration.
Character Design.


I think this would be amazing especially with next-gen consoles or if it was just pc only because of the graphical capabilities, and I really enjoyed the manga so I think if someone made it a game it would be amazing.

This new premise has become a rising gem! It reminds me of “My New Life As A Villainess!” and “Scum-Villain’s Self-Saving System” in the awareness of our main character, but it presents this main character as starting as a reader and taking up the role of hero immediately without being placed in the mind of an antagonist! I’m greatly considering it!

Few facts comparison between Omniscient Reader Viewpoint (ORV) and Solo Leveling (SL):-

ORV
Original production: as webnovel in Munpia 2018 (korean) & Webnovel 2018 (english)
Current adaptation: as manhwa in Naver webtoon 2020 (korean) & LINE webtoon 2020 (english), as eBook in Munpia & Naver 2021 (korean)
Writer of webnovel: Sing-Shong
Artist of manhwa: Redice Studio
Theme: Apocalyptic fantasy
Future adaptation: live-action movies, drama/anime (?)
Summary: Kim Dokja, as per his name meaning 'only child/reader', has an average life, the only thing keeping him up to live day by day is through reading a webnovel entitled ""Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse"" or TWSA, written by tls123, which has been serialized for 10 years. He realizes he is the only reader that read up to the final chapter. However, before he can read the epilogue, the moment the author declared TWSA to be monetized at 7pm of his current time, the entire world starts being thrown upside down with apocalyptic situation similar to his favourite TWSA setup. Being the only person who knows how the ruined world will end, Dokja struggles to survive using his knowledge as the omniscient reader in order to reach the epilogue he wish to witness. Little did he know, the world, the companions & characters, the system he grows to love and hate are beyond any fable he could comprehend.

SL 
Original production: as webnovel in Papyrus + KakaoPage 2014 + 2015 (korean) & Webnovel 2018 (english)
Current adaptation: as manhwa in D&C + KakaoPage webtoon 2018 (korean) & Webnovel + Tappytoon webtoon 2020 (english)
Writer of webnovel: Chugong
Artist of manhwa: Redice Studio
Theme: Action fantasy
Future adaptation: game, drama
Summary: 10 years ago, the Earth is plagued with various extraterrestrial-like Gates that connect two different worlds; monsters and humans. Along their existence is a special power gifted to some humans, giving the latter ability to hunt monsters inside the Gates (known mostly as dungeons) and mines the rare, magic-imbued materials within. Hence, 'hunters' and 'guilds' are established as part of the political balance. Sung Jin-Woo, dubbed by many as the World's Weakest Hunter, is an E-rank hunter with high tenacity to keep diving into near-death experience during hunting for the sake of his family. Comes his final hunt in unexpected double dungeon with death cannot be avoided, some sort of 'system' suddenly appear, giving him option to actually survive from the fatal attack. Since then, he takes the opportunity to learn about the system that only he can access and use it to level up his power, just as how the system is using him to make him stronger than average hunter's capability. Throughout his journey to power up, he overcomes each quest, penalty, enemy, ability limit while finding out the real objective of the system and Gates manifest on Earth.

*Opinion*: -
Tbh, i like both series equally since they are totally different. The only similarity I can see is the art style. Both are slow burn in term of progress from the beginning, but become stronger after 1/6 point and pretty consistent to the end. SL plot is mediocre thus easy to understand, whereas ORV plot is complex. SL has straightforward attack description of action that led immediate impact, whereas ORV has multiple attack engagements with world history-related that may require a bit of thinking before the impact of any action. SL gaming system is only applicable to MC that powers by an entity, whereas ORV apply streaming system to all characters powers by fable/story. SL reaches international popularity due to webtoon hype, whereas ORV has gained international high recognition with webnovel. However, I find myself able to engage more with ORV due to the characters and world-building, especially towards Kim Dokja. I resent and support him, happy and cry for him, empathize and sympathize with him, altogether at the same time.

it's an open ending. so you get to imagine whatever ending you want  there's also multiple loops and paradoxes in the novel, so it's one hell of a roller coaster. I recommend for ppl to read the novel too if you dont like waiting for new chapters of the manhwa. ANYWAYS, orv rules

I never thought I’d see the day webtoon puts a system-esque manhwa on its platform. I assumed it’d never happen... but then again, with Solo Levelling, they’d probably  want to get in on it. Hopefully they’ll put more web novel adapted manhwas on their platform, it’d be nice if they were a bit more mainstream

ATTENTION WEBTOON READERS

I have a full list of high quality manhwa (webtoons) that are not sponsored by webtoon, and I want to spread awareness because some of these are really good. So if anyone wants the list, leave a reply. I’ll recommend a few of my favorites:

Who made me a princess - romance/drama
Beware of the villainess - comedy, drama, romance
The beginning after the end - action/isekai/drama
Insoo’s law - school life/isekai (same author as oh holy)
Lady baby - romance/drama/back in time
The villainess reverses the hourglass - drama/back in time
Death is the only ending for the villainess - drama

There is so much more, to find these literally just look them up online, or use tapas. Like I said, leave a reply for the full list, and if you’re wondering, my favorites are the top 3.

I remember reading this on the  webnovel site. The MC (or viewpoint character if you will) could not stop mentioning how he was the only one to read a certain book to the end. Could have made a drinking game out of it. Now, it's a webtoon? Let's see if they kept that aspect or toned it down.

I'm just finished reading the novel this week and.. God. 

I can't help it but love and hate the epilogue. One way, I feel like the ending was just so ""ORV"" that you can make up whatever you want from the ambiguous ending but then again I just really want one or two chapter where everything's finally.. Okay?

Maybe after the comics there will be anime...

Okay soo.... I calculated for how many years it will take for the manhwa to finish

There are a total of 551 chapters in the novel

1 week = 1 chapter
1 month = 4 chapters
1 year = 48 chapters

 
 
so 551 chapters / 48 chapters a year = 11.4791666667 years

 
 
(11 years x 365 days = 4015 total days to finish)

And I didn't include other variables that may affect the number of chapters made (eg. months of hiatus and that they'll shorten/cut some scenes from the novel so that they can catch up and won't take too long to be completed)

So maybe the estimated years to finish will be about 10-12 years at least because the artist needs to take hiatus to prepare for the next season and also if there's any accidents or health issues.

Damn that's long but I'll wait because I'm so excited to see it drawn.

Aren't we all The Most Ancient Dream, rather than a constelation? Since HSY basically wrote orv and the ending of the epilouge was left to be ambigious, leaving us to use our own imagination on what we think the ending is, basically 'dreaming' about it

Massive Spoiler

I think that Han Sooyung and Kim Dokja is the canon ship here, there's this underlying meaning on how Sooyung would write a novel only for one person to read and that is Kim Dokja and Dokja even accepted Han Sooyung's proposal of reading her novel,  Dokja even suggested for its genre to be romance! ROMANCE!! With Kim Dokja even warning her that if he read her novel he might complain, that he's picky, that he would always bug her with comments and that it is possible that he would bug her for more chapters to which Han Sooyung is really glad since that's what Han Sooyung has been searching for.  Han Sooyung was jealous of tls123 (won't spoil who that is  but those who read until final will know ;3) because tls123 got Kim Dokja who would always comment on every single chapter and she really wanted someone like Kim Dokja too. ""If this story can really save you..."" ""Then I'll keep writing the epilogue for you until the end of time, for eternity."" THIS BASICALLY SHOWS THAT SHE IS WILLING TO GIVE HER ENTIRETY TO HIM FOR ALL ETERNITY. For the last chapters all she has been doing is writing all day and all night in hopes of saving Kim Dokja, she's willing to give her time for all eternity to Kim Dokja and she was the one who basically saved him. Han Sooyung literally saved him in more ways than one with even saving Kim Dokja before the start of everything, there is a paradox within this context ;3 Readers will know. Is it not obvious just how much Han Sooyung means to Kim Dokja and how much Kim Dokja means to Han Sooyung??? They are literally made for each other, the beginning and the end, from before everything started, how everything started, from the start, every moment and until the conclusion. Han Sooyung saved Kim Dokja and Kim Dokja saved Han Sooyung. Kim Dokja agreeing to be her reader means he would dedicate everything of him to her for all eternity, as Kim Dokja said, he is just a reader, and this really shows everything about him-he is a reader. By becoming Han Sooyung's reader, he's basically dedicating his entirety to her. AND they're both constellations, they can literally be with each other, FOREVER. Han Sooyung would write for Kim Dokja for all of eternity and Kim Dokja would dedicate all of himself as a reader for Han Sooyung for all of eternity. HONESTLY THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT TOGETHER. ABSOLUTELY. IN THE LAST CHAPTERS EVEN IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF HAN SOOYUNG'S LONGING FOR KIM DOKJA THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO SAVE KIM DOKJA WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE. She dedicated dedicated her humanity to Kim Dokja, her everything to him and Kim Dokja also lived and was saved because of her, dedicating his all, being Han Sooyung's reader for all of eternity just for her. This is absolutely love, it may even be the truest love I've ever seen. They dedicate everything of themselves to each other, for all of their ■■ ETERNITY.

This seems like an awesome idea. I haven't checked it out, but it is an awesome idea. 
In addition, literature that precedes reality is nothing new. If you will, Revolutions can begin in underground settings, with secret meetings and literature dissemination. Lots of it. Revolutions then manifest into cultural and political upheaval, more than a coup...Well, maybe size or dimensions doesn't ameays matter. A coup d'etat or a Revolution from those who suffer oppression and ruling class dictatorship begin in many cases in history with rhetoric and a heavy emphasis of dissemination of

This is way better than Solo Leveling. The only thing why Solo Leveling is so popular right now is because the art.The more I read this, the more it feels like one of those soulless cultivation Manhuas where the MC gets more and more OP and crushes his opposition easily with little effort. When I first started reading this, I thought there would be some depth to the story, given how the confrontation with the statues played out. But right now it's not anything like that. There doesn't seem to be any struggle or deep thoughts or philosophy in the story, just constant power ups. Except for the MC, all the other characters are very forgettable due to how one dimensional they are and it seems the MC is rapidly turning one dimensional and forgettable as well. It's almost impossible to be emotionally invested in this story, unlike in a good shounen like Naruto or One Piece. Solo Leveling didn’t even get popular until the mahwa come out and become a huge hit while ORV is already popular before the mahwa come out. That’s the different.

Accept Jesus as the Son of God. According to the Bible, all Christians who recognize Jesus as the Son of God are able to be saved.

Read about Jesus’ death on the cross to understand salvation. In the Bible, God sends Jesus to Earth so that he can die and absolve humanity of original sin.

Devote yourself fully to God in everything you do. ...
If your confuse just do this if you want to be saved do this repent  know that you are a sinner , believe  that Christ  died for you for your sins  and That God raised him from the dead  on the third day . If you believe it  with all your heart all your soul and all your mind you will be saved by  The Holy's of Holy's.  Amen

What the hell. Webtoon is such a addictive app My first story I am reading is freaking romance And i just read 60 episodes in a day without any break. As it comes only on sunday so I want something to pass my time. So I started reading true beauty and again i read 100 episodes in a day. I am just confused how it can be that much of my type. I am just 11 and It has improved my english very much.
Hope I have written right english.

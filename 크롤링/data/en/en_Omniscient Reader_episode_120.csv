120,"Aug 31, 2022",who else could it be if not our beloved protagonist 😂
120,"Aug 31, 2022",ALWAYS WITH THE DRAMATIC ENTRANCES🥰🥰 WE STAN SUPREME KING!!!!
120,"Aug 31, 2022","So like...it has to be Junghyeok right...? Also it pisses me off that these people are really acting like they're better than everyone else when DOKJA was the one that would've sat on the throne if he hadn't destroyed it. I hate politicians🙄Like imagine your whole personality being ""Im a politician who only knows how to lie and manipulate others"" ew."
120,"Aug 31, 2022","THE CLIFFHANGER ON JOONGHYUK'S ALWAYS EXTRAVAGANT, EXPLOSIVE ENTRANCE 🤩 THEY REALLY WANT US TO ANTICIPATE HIS ARRIVAL LMAO. I BET MY COINS THAT HE WILL LOOK AS ANGRY AS ALWAYS"
120,"Aug 31, 2022",dramatic cracker eating
120,"Aug 31, 2022",IDK how I always forget about the 2nd main character even though he is the MAIN character.
120,"Aug 31, 2022",For a sec I thought Dokja ate an explosive biscuit 😅
120,"Aug 31, 2022",“Dokja… i’ll kill you”
120,"Aug 31, 2022","Haha, Dokja really was like ima sit back and let my homie take this one xD"
120,"Aug 31, 2022",Doja is like “y’all ain’t even the M.C. “
120,"Aug 31, 2022",How can a corrupt politician attribute be rare 🤣
120,"Aug 31, 2022","OK so, you know that uncomfortable feeling you get when you decline taking the Ruler's Throne with a spiel about democracy, and then some slimy nobody of a politician tries to act like he has a right to a place among the actual Kings with the same spiel, and you really REALLY want to knock him out? 🤔 😏"
120,"Aug 31, 2022","nobody remembers the last king, but he is inevitable. "
120,"Aug 31, 2022",NO 😭 WHY ARE YOU GIVING THE UGLIEST CHAIR TO DOKJA. THAT CHAIR DOESN'T DESERVE HIM
120,"Aug 31, 2022",Huiwon is just so damn likable. She was so worried for Dokja...  lol.  Asking him to shout if he gets into trouble 😂😂
120,"Aug 31, 2022",YJH: I have no time to waste and I WILL kill everyone. Walls are time wasting. || KDJ: *On the otherside of the wall eating cookies* hey YJH.
120,"Aug 31, 2022","[Constellation"" Dragon of the Peach Tree"" laughs at the politician and kings as they argue while the person who will decide the participants has just arrived. 5 coins have been sponsored.]"
120,"Aug 31, 2022","I mean, if you want the best chance of clearing the scenario then it seems like Dokja's crew plus Junghyeok and the Wanderer King is pretty much who you want going. And that actually might be exactly 10 people, but I've lost track of our current party count."
120,"Aug 31, 2022",Why bother dealing with the politician when you have the protagonist here. Just scream if something happens. 
120,"Aug 31, 2022","Darn, why we got a corrupt politician here? 💀 Please just go over there, don't wanna see you."
120,"Aug 31, 2022",so why is the Corrupt politician attribute rare? it should be uncommon at most.
120,"Aug 31, 2022",he really got the lawn chair...
120,"Sep 2, 2022",Junghyeok... There's a door... For once can you enter the scene like a normal person? 😂
120,"Aug 31, 2022",Protagonist can never just walk through the door always gotta make an entrance 
120,"Sep 1, 2022",Junghyeok… my brother in Omniscient Reader… why must you be like this… 😂 😂 🤣 
120,"Aug 31, 2022","I cannot get of the fail condition ""Forbidden from entering the Underworld"" like if our man doesn't win that quest his soul is GONE when he dies."
120,"Aug 31, 2022","First thing first, please beat this cocky corrupted bastard here, yoo joonghyuk..."
120,"Sep 14, 2022",The koolaid man is the last king!?
120,"Oct 5, 2022",Dokja is writing fanfic in real time with entry lines like that🤣
120,"Aug 31, 2022","Someone to hate and an epic entrance, what will happen next... "
120,"Sep 28, 2022","I didn't notice until someone pointed it out, but I just absolutely love Dokja being given the shittiest plastic lawn chair lmfao"
120,"Aug 31, 2022","""corrupt politician"" is an oxymoron. They're always corrupt. "
120,"Oct 5, 2022","I don’t know if anybody noticed but the kings respective chairs correlate with what type of king they are. For example the king of wanderer’s has a folding chair at the meeting, because a folding chair can be taking anywhere and is fit for a wanderer. Dokja has a cheap plastic chair, meaning he isn’t a real king, not worthy of a “real” quality chair. All of them have their own chairs and how it relates to them being kings."
120,"Sep 28, 2022",Dodja be like: I'm going to grab this cookie.... and  EAT IT
120,"Oct 5, 2022",Why do I want Dokja to just say “hi darling” with the most dead face and tone
120,"Aug 31, 2022",Wanderer King is dokja‘s mother right? I can’t wait to see them have an actual conversation once this meeting nonsense is over with. 
120,"Oct 5, 2022",You’ve been reading this for 840 days to get to this point… feel old?
120,"Oct 1, 2022",it's so funny how these kings are trying to claim their place in the scenario as if Dokja and his party members hadn't carried them all the way
120,"Oct 5, 2022",first thing Junghyeok will probably do after breaking in: KIM DOKJAAAAAAAAA
120,"Sep 28, 2022","Guard: you shall not passJunghyeok: yes I shall, Dokja... a dead man...  is in there"
120,"Sep 28, 2022","Can't he just properly use the entrance? 🥴 Then, again.. those guards may have stopped him. "
120,"Sep 28, 2022",aren't there 10 kings in Seoul? kings should just go by themselves instead of taking any followers.
120,"Aug 31, 2022","[The Constellation ""The Red King"" is amused at incarnation Dokja Kim's subtle announcement of the arrival of incarnation Junghyeok Yu. 2000 coins have been sponsored] "
120,"Oct 5, 2022",corrupt politician (rare) LMFAOOOOO
120,"Sep 1, 2022",The neutral king’s pupils make him untrustworthy 
120,"Oct 5, 2022",Dokja ate that biscuit like he's in Death Note
120,"Sep 28, 2022",Junghyeok has entered the chat
120,"Sep 28, 2022",OMG THE SUPREME KING DOKJAS HUSBAND HAS ARRIVED D JSJDJA and I have no coins left.
120,"Sep 1, 2022",Okay can I please have an explanation for what bribes level five is like does that mean that you're really good at giving them or taking them  I desperately need an explanation.
120,"Aug 31, 2022",anytime we're talking about his King position this dude is blowing through a wall does being called a king piss him off or something
120,"Oct 5, 2022","lmaoo, dude deadass would not be alive if dokja hadnt destroyed the throne and done like a million other things"
120,"Oct 5, 2022","aww they cut it just too soon.  I like how in the novel he busts a huge hole in the wall and casually says ""I will now announce who will be taking part in the scenario."" as if he didn't *just bust a hole in the wall*"
120,"Sep 29, 2022",corrupt politician (rare)💀💀
120,"Sep 28, 2022",IT'S THE SUNFISH!!! WE STAN OUR SUPREME KING!
120,"Oct 7, 2022",KIM DOKJA... WHATS WITH THE AGGRESSIVE CRACKER BITE HELP

120,"Oct 7, 2022","Personal Attribute: Corrupt Politician (RARE)Hahahaha! If its in my country, they are everywhere 😂"
120,"Oct 7, 2022","it's funny how 3 of them are dressed in a historical way, the corrupt guy is dressed as a modern corrupt politician and only Dokja is dressed like apocalyptic survivor "
120,"Oct 7, 2022",Corrupt Politician (Rare): Bullshit. They're all corrupt by default.

120,"Oct 5, 2022",I just noticed from the comments that dokja's chair is so basic lmaoo 😂
120,"Oct 5, 2022","loving the use of different chairs to reflect the character personalities. our boy gets a plain plastic lawn chair because he knows function matters more than appearance, politician gets some fancy chair, queen of beauty has a comfortable one...etc. very cool little bit of symbolism."
120,"Sep 11, 2022","""Corrupt Politician (Rare)"" Lies"
120,"Sep 2, 2022","Ok, so let me get this straight. None of us no that random politician guy right? Ok cool. So, clearly no one knows who this guy is, he's never been present in any scenario so far, and he just wants everyone to trust him with the fate of the scenario? Yeah not a chance 🙄"
120,"Sep 1, 2022",Dokja waiting on his boyfriend before he starts his argument.

120,"Oct 6, 2022",I’m a little surprised that “corrupt politician” a rare attribute is. That’s how you can tell this is Fantasy.

120,"Oct 5, 2022",Did that last  scene remind anyone of Light eating the bag of chips while writing in the Death Note under surveillance? 😹😹 
120,"Oct 5, 2022",It surprises me that somehow they forgot TWO kings. The supreme king and the fake King

120,"Oct 5, 2022",Ya'll it's episode 119 and in Taiwan (maybe other countries too) that's the emergency number for the hospital and/or fire station. Dokja didn't exactly dial 119 with his cookie but hey you-know-who is showing up to save the day so-

120,"Oct 5, 2022","eats cookies, wall fucking explodes"
120,"Oct 5, 2022","So by this point we've all guessed that The King of Wanderers is Dokja's mom, right? I wonder when she'll reveal herself to Dokja. (P.S: And no, I'm not a light novel reader. I think this Webtoon foreshadowed very heavily that it's his mom, so I'm very confident it's her.)"
120,"Oct 5, 2022",it's not gonna be a proper kings meeting without Junghyeok
120,"Oct 5, 2022",Kim Dokja your husband's finally here 😂

120,5 days ago,"Ok seriously, I'm like, pretty sure the King of Wanderers is someone related to Dokja. But since he was bullied and was friendless back in school, and the only coworker he seems to get along with is already with him, perhaps the King of Wanderers is someone from his family? Was it ever stated that she has a sister or something?"

Ok, maybe someone who has read the webtoon adaptation more recently than I have can help me out here…have they talked about the king of wanderers’ backstory yet?

120,"Oct 5, 2022",Why did Dokja think to himself about something that “usually happens”? That caught me off guard; he’s not a regressor with multiple runthroughs. Is it just because he knew from reading TSA that that’s what usually happened in many of JH’s regressions?
120,"Oct 5, 2022",they do say dramatic timing is one of dokja's skills

120,"Oct 5, 2022","Well now, that's a mind-blowing entrance"
120,"Oct 5, 2022","With that dramatic entrance, and for Dokja's attitude, I think it's safe to assume it's the king of drama, Junghyeok"

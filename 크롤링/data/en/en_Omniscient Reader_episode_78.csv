Episode,Date,Review
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Our main character and the main character are bonding! And arguing. And then bonding again….And even more arguing😂
78,"Nov 10, 2021",I know that golden thread anywhere.
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Sangah has joined the chat
78,"Nov 10, 2021","The interactions between Dokja and Junghyeok in this chapter are just wonderful. The latter glares from behind but Dokja keeps going -_-
It cracks me up every time."
78,"Nov 10, 2021",this is the most dialogue we ever got of junghyeok. comforting to know even while being emotionally vunerable his murderous intent toward dokja never wanes <3
78,"Nov 10, 2021","Reading about all of Jungchyeok's regressions sounds like it would be pretty sick. Going with him through the relationships he has to rebuild each time, the betrayals by his previous allies, seeing him fall to madness. I can see why Dokja read TWSA to the end"
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Junghyeok needed to be incapacitated just to have a normal conversation with him😂
78,"Nov 10, 2021","look at our Dokja fanboying his protagonist lmao but that aside, its clear he really cares for Yu Junghyeok"
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Aww I actually really enjoyed watching those two become just a little bit closer. Lowkey hope they'll be friends at some point. Their dynamic is hilarious 😂
78,"Nov 10, 2021",I love the development between Dokja and Junghyeok. 🥰
78,"Nov 10, 2021","I like how dokja is starting to see the ""characters"" more as people now. I think its helping him emotionally"
78,"Nov 10, 2021","When it says “just one punch”, shouldn’t it be Dokja rather than Junghyeok saying that??"
78,"Nov 10, 2021","It’s weird to have two “main characters” but entertaining nonetheless, and it works out since either of them aren’t treated as side characters. They are both protected by plot…. For now"
78,"Nov 10, 2021","Dokja is really grinding his social skills.
Wish I could speak freely with my potential murderer on my back, and psycho companion with a godess complex on my left."
78,"Nov 10, 2021",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' wanted to advice the incarnation 'YJH' to bring chocolates next time to win the gal.][The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' says that food is the key to get into relationships.] [5 coins have been sponsored. ]
78,"Nov 10, 2021","[Incarnation Dokja Kim has unlocked the achievement PIGGYBACK COMPANION[And leveled up his achievement SUPREME SASS, and TRUTH BOMB[he has also maxed out the achievement PISSING OFF PEOPLE AT THE WRONG TIME]'"
78,"Nov 10, 2021",I understand the constellation that keeps sponsoring Dokja whenever he’s with Junghyeok. Like damn they got chemistry 
78,"Nov 10, 2021","Spiderman: ""Everybody gets one."""
78,"Nov 10, 2021",This is the very start of Jung-Hyeok and Dokja CompanionSHIP 👀👀🌚🌚
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Bonding moments after saving his life just keep giving Dokja +1 hubby points lol
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Why is this chapter somehow so cute
78,"Nov 10, 2021","I really enjoyed this episode, finally a bit of peaceful and productive conversation within the 2 of them. Very refreshing to see them try to collaborate for the greater good "
78,"Nov 10, 2021",It's so nice Dokja and Junghyeok are having a meaningful conversation for once instead of fighting 
78,"Nov 10, 2021",If Junghyeok lands that payback punch on Dokja he might seriously die at this point.
78,"Nov 10, 2021",They make a good couple 🤣
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Words can’t describe how much I love this
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Dokja and Jungyeok working together is definitely something I could get used to
78,"Nov 10, 2021",THATS THE GIRLS GLOWING ROPE THING IF I AM CORRECT
78,"Nov 11, 2021",Is it just me or did Kdj and Yjh talk more in this chap than the whole webtoon?
78,"Nov 10, 2021",That free punch may not kill you later but it will hurt... alot
78,"Nov 10, 2021",I love how KDJ just keeps giving YJH more reasons to whack him XD
78,"Nov 10, 2021",The interaction between them is honestly really adorable. I feel bad though that his lover from his past regression is trying to kill him though...that's honestly really rough buddy😬The interaction between the guys though had me laughing almost the whole chapter especially him not being able to promise not to kill Dokja🤣
78,"Nov 10, 2021",These two argue and get along like a married couple who've been together for 30 years
78,"Nov 10, 2021","Damn, I feel bad for Yoo Joonghyuk. That's rough buddy "
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Imagin not having the talent 
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Dont you love it when you get to have a heart to heart with your favourite protagonist while giving him a piggy back ride. after punching him with 100 strength and then nursing him back to health with a specially concocted antidote against the poison inflicted on him by his potentially evil ex-regression girlfriend whom he visited to heal his destroyed innards from your 100 strength punch
78,"Nov 10, 2021","This reminds me of Batman's chat with Joker. Why is Joker the way he is and refuses for help. Joker explains his situation as someone walking the tight rope on two huge buildings ( I think). It's dark, and the person can't see what's below, just what's infront. Another person holding a lighter. He sees the glow of the flame, yet also sees how the rope would snap if said person were to betray him. Or somethin like that"
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Jungyeok Yu: If I have to regress then so be it. but best believe I am spending coins for this punch
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Junghyeok needing Dokja's help but also wanting to kill him has me lmao😂😂
78,"Dec 15, 2021",junghyeok's glowing eyes are so fun
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Uriel[JUDGE OF DEMONIC FIRE] is probably running out of popcorn while watching Dokja journey and probably also shipping him with Joongyhyuk lol.The Yaoi fan is strong is with this archangel
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Dokja and Junghyeok are just a married couple at this point
78,"Nov 14, 2021",i know dokja's crying inside remembering junghyeok has/had a lover.
78,"Dec 15, 2021",imagine being able to talk to your comfort character and CONSOLE him like Dokja just did
78,"Dec 1, 2021",Why do I ship them so much
78,"Nov 10, 2021","['Sangah-man Sangah-man, does whatever a Sagah can. Spins a thread, any size, protect friends on any side. look out, here comes the Sangah-man'.Constellation ""Dragon of the  Peach Tree""  is  now asking others to sing along]"
78,"Dec 15, 2021",OK TELL ME WHY JUNGHYEOK LOOKS SO DAMN PRETTY IN THES EPISODE LIKE HIS HAIR AND ESPECIALLY HIS EYES LIKE :'D I LOVE IT And I love this episode of the arguing and bonding and I just love the see Dokja and Junghyeok interacting It just fills my heart with joy man 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
78,"Dec 15, 2021","FFS Webtoons translators. Can you even try to be consistent? Only 2 chapters ago the skill was called THE WAY OF THE WIND (which is correct), yet this chapter you call it The Path of the Wind?!?!?!?!?!?!?!  It's sad that this is the ""official"" translation.  I understand if you make a translation choice that differs from the novel, however if you do BE CONSISTENT. Also Wuxia World?!?! No- Murim World.... Other World God?! No- Outer God. #rant"
78,"Nov 10, 2021",I'll never get tired of spending my money on this masterpiece. [5 coins have been sponsored.]
78,"Dec 15, 2021","Kim Dokja: i'm cold //  Yoo Jonghyuk: what? [removes coat] i TOLD you to bring more layers but you DIDN’T listen, and now [piles scarves on her] I’VE got to make sure you don’t freeze to death [takes someone else’s hat] how long have you been cold??? you should’ve said something sooner, idiot."
78,"Dec 15, 2021",i love their interactions so much!! and jungheok's face when dokja said he didnt have talent to learn the skill was hilarious 😂😂
78,"Dec 15, 2021",When even poisoned and unable to move is still menacing as heck.
78,"Dec 15, 2021",Lol our two MCs are so funny when they’re together 
78,"Nov 16, 2021",That moment when you realize you f-up for stealing someone else's stuff  and now you might be the reason why everyone might die.
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Imagine being Joonghyuk’s lover T-T
78,"Nov 10, 2021","oh, oh, this must be an evolution of (I can't think of her name) the girl with strings ability!"
78,"Dec 15, 2021",The black hair trio lol
78,"Dec 15, 2021","as a fujoshi, this entire episode isn't good for my heart and my sanity, just barely locking my thoughts away"
78,"Nov 10, 2021",has to be one of my favorite episode/chapters
78,"Nov 12, 2021",I like how Dokja and the other mc are bonding it's nice
78,"Dec 15, 2021","Kim Dokja: Well I can't mansplain, manipulate, manwhore my way out of this one… //Yoo Jongyuk: *pulling out his sword* Manslaughter it is then."
78,"Dec 15, 2021",can i ship these 2? :(
78,"Nov 10, 2021",it's awesome to learn more information.
78,"Dec 15, 2021","Han Sooyoung: Can you at least try to see this from my perspective? //Kim Dokja: *crouches down* //
Yoo Jonghyuk: *kneels* //
Han Sooyoung: I hate you both."
78,"Dec 15, 2021","I wish dokja and junghyeuk become good friends in future, it was also nice to know that for the first time junghyeuk was understood by someone else it's kinda sad as well "
78,"Dec 15, 2021","It’s always unsettling whenever Dokja gets this dead look in his eyes, KDJ is very unpredictable as is but it must be so terrifying to his companions because they don’t know what stunt he will pull and just how grave the consequences will be"
78,"Dec 15, 2021","i thought it was ""way of the wind"" as the previous chapters, why is it ""path of the wind"" now? (refer chapter 75)"
78,"Nov 15, 2021",I can't be the only one who finds [Path of the Wind] weird. [Way of the Wind] sounds better
78,"Dec 16, 2021","Kim Dokja: They say, ""you can't love someone unless you love yourself."" //Kim Dokja: Bullshit. //
Kim Dokja: I have never loved myself. //
Kim Dokja: But Jonghyuk? //
Kim Dokja: I love him so much I forgot what it's like to hate myself."
78,"Nov 10, 2021",love the depths of each and every character. best girl is back next chapter!
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Sangah?
78,"Dec 15, 2021","""But I wanted to believe, even for a moment, that she was still the same woman of my memories"" wow, I just realized I didn't see him as very humane up until now"
78,"Dec 22, 2021",married couples argue most of the time... 
78,"Dec 16, 2021",The face Dokja makes after he says “She was his lover” is pure gold. My guys has time for zero romance BS
78,"Dec 15, 2021","Yeah, Seolhwa (?) Lee might have been your lover in a previous regression, but now there's something called Dokja Kim here."
78,"Dec 15, 2021",well today🤣 I got my new ship Dokja and Junghyeok😅pls no hate
78,"Dec 23, 2021",junghyeok and dokja’s interaction makes me ship them so hard i’m writing fanfic for them as we speak 😳😩😩😭😭😭 i love their dynamic so much
78,"Dec 23, 2021",wow you can have an actual conversation with only the occasional death threats and menacing glares as long as he's completely immobilized and incapacitated for two to three days
78,"Dec 23, 2021","author nim, there's still time to make junghyeok and dokja a couple"
78,"Dec 22, 2021",Junghyeok is like I won't kill you cuz just one punch is enough to make you experience near death
78,"Dec 19, 2021",why r they fruity
78,"Dec 19, 2021","""Maybe i don't understand this person very well"" [ Your understansing of this person has increased.] "
78,"Dec 16, 2021",I love the fact that I am reading a story about a character who read a story and is arguing with the main character of that story
78,"Dec 15, 2021","first time that kdj has a decent chat with yjh, almost forget that he is not just a killing machine. "
78,"Dec 15, 2021","dokja's face when he was finished talking about YJH' EX-lover, can only be described as one thing. Y'all figure it out hehe"
78,"Dec 8, 2021",Arguing like husband and wife 
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Oh god.. now that I’m remembering the novel. I’m absolutely going to die when you draw the demon-like-judge-of-fire.. 😂 
78,"Dec 22, 2021",Dokja looks so dejected and upset when he thought of Junghyeok’s ex-girlfriend lmaoooo 😂💀
78,"Dec 22, 2021",Seolhwa 💕 ahh I love her so much 💕💕
78,"Dec 19, 2021","Demon-like Judge of Fire: ""More please. MORE PLEAAAAASEEEEEEEEEE!!"
78,"Dec 16, 2021",uriel is having a nosebleed by now
78,"Dec 15, 2021",smh yet another gay bonding sesh...
78,"Dec 8, 2021",They argue like a married couple😂 
78,"Nov 14, 2021","There was a mistake in one of the panels, it says: [Junghyeok Yu]: “Just one punch, okay? You have to go easy on me.” I think that it should’ve been Dokja Kim saying it rather than Junghyeok Yu."
78,"Nov 10, 2021",They’re like an old married couple
78,"Dec 23, 2021",Omg.... why do I ship them now? This is not a feeling I expected.
78,"Dec 15, 2021","honestly their dynamics are just irresistible; their shipper or not, you can't help but want to see more of their interactions... sure it's kdj-yjh dynamics, but at the same time also reader-protagonist dynamics and it shows. well this also applied to any of yoo-han-kim interaction, and I can't help but find it intriguing."
78,"Dec 15, 2021",no bc the way they're arguing is pure gold and I'm convinced their relationship alone is one of the most dynamic part of this webtoon
78,"Dec 15, 2021",those two argue like an old married couple and its hilarious.
78,"Dec 15, 2021","two main characters together, the only thing that they can do is bond and argue over and over again"
78,"Dec 15, 2021",The chemistry tho😏😏
78,"Nov 11, 2021","""No, it's because I don't have the talent."" - I felt that😑"
78,"Nov 11, 2021","God it’s so nice seeing these scenes from the novel visually, it’s really lovely getting to re-experience the story like this :) I’m happy I’ll have this to follow for quite a while! <3"
78,"Dec 24, 2021",Our MCs are becoming BFFs
78,"Dec 21, 2021",they act like they're 12 years into a marriage. 🔪😌
78,"Dec 19, 2021",the way YJH glare is giving a goosebumps tho😂
78,"Dec 19, 2021",Junghyeok should probably bring Dokja as his wingman the next time he tries talking to his past lover 🤣 
78,"Dec 15, 2021","probably the first time seeing Junghyeok talking like that..and dokja,he really cares about yjh... "
78,"Dec 15, 2021","Yoo Sangah: So, what do you guys do? You’ve become close despite being at each other's throats before. //Han  Sooyoung: (What am I supposed to say? We’re Friends? I don't want them to think that's all they are to me but I can't give away our secrets.) // Kim Dokja, through Midday Rendezvous: (Whatever you do, don't say anything about murdering. I'll just say we're something cool, like comrades. Bound by a blood pact.) // Yoo Jonghyuk: We like to meet at my apartment for unspecified activities."
78,"Dec 19, 2021",I can’t be the only that ships them 😭🤚🏽 like just kiss already 🙄
78,"Dec 16, 2021",I love how he can just piss someone off within seconds
78,"Dec 15, 2021",I just think dokja will play greaaattt role in making Junghyeok more human...
78,"Dec 15, 2021",As someone who read the novel some of you are really pathetic trying to claim “shippers” can’t enjoy the comic. And this is coming from someone that rarely ship anything. What matters is people like the series and if people ship the main two guys or two girls together let them bc they are not harming anyone
78,"Dec 15, 2021","""but you'll have to go easy on me"" OH MY GOOOO BRUH U HAVE NO IDEA HOW CUTELY IT SOUNDS AND NOT EVEN BECAUSE THE GAY TENSION LIKE OW FVCK THIS IS SO CUTEEEE"
78,"Dec 15, 2021","No matter how much crazy sh*t happens, I am always amazed at how well Dokja is still wearing that suit through the apocalypse. a lot of Fallout NPCs would be jealous. Glad he and Jungyeok Yu had a somewhat normal conversation until the only thing saving Dokja from the man on his back is pseudo paralysis."
78,"Dec 15, 2021",YES I MISS THIS WOMEN HELL YEAAA WOOOOO
78,"Dec 15, 2021","Maybe I’m being silly, but where is Lazy Broke Weeb? I miss their comments :("
78,"Nov 14, 2021","Ahhh, Sangah is reuniting with Dokja! I can't wait to see the crew reassembling. I wonder what new skills they've picked up. I'm addicted to this series. 5 coins have been sponsored."
78,"Nov 10, 2021","Damn I love this series so much, from the action to the humor to each character and the art even, this is my favorite on Webtoon right now!"
78,"Apr 12, 2022",old married couple vibesss
78,"Dec 28, 2021",I have a feeling that a certain constellation would be pleased with their development 
78,"Dec 23, 2021",Dokja : i said that as a joke but i don't think it's a joke anymore XD
78,"Dec 22, 2021","It's pretty interesting to see Junghyeouk Yu becoming more of a human, you know. Especially his relationship with poison beauty. I kinda feel for him tbh. 😟😟😟😟"
78,"Dec 21, 2021",why’re they always fruity man
78,"Dec 20, 2021","jongdok is sailing again, despite already finish reading the novel, looking at the picture itself is way more 👌👁️👄👁️"
78,"Dec 19, 2021",Lol although I'm not sure if I support it or not but the Jong Kim ship is setting up sail!
78,"Dec 19, 2021",Junghyeok's character had a lot more depth than I ever imagined. he felt very flat and 2D as far as he was shown but this episode shows a very different person. it's hard to think of them as the same. I really love how this is expanding :)
78,"Dec 19, 2021",There comes our Friendly Neighborhood Spiderman 🕸️🕷️
78,"Dec 17, 2021",Okay but Sangah in the next episode’s thumbnail... Ma’am...
78,"Dec 17, 2021",bro we need more dokja and junghyeok moments with disabled junghyeok-
78,"Dec 16, 2021","This comic is so freaking good. Sometimes action stories are more focused on the action and, well, less on the story. But the story in this one is just so well done. You can tell the lore runs deep and it’s just 🤌🏼"
78,"Dec 16, 2021",Lmao that argue like a married couple 
78,"Dec 16, 2021","I can never get enough of the interactions between the mc and the ""mc"""
78,"Dec 16, 2021",spider man saves the day again
78,"Dec 16, 2021","reading about Joonghyuk's past always makes my heart ache T_T on the other hand, imagining a bright-eyed, compassionate yjh with hopes and dreams is kinda funny in a way..."
78,"Dec 15, 2021",they will really make a great couple HAHAHAAH.. 
78,"Dec 15, 2021","Yoo Jonghyuk: So, you basically choose an answer and that will determine how your love life will be? // Han Sooyoung: Can’t believe we have to go over this. How haven’t you played a dating sim before? // Lee Jihye: Dating sims can be really fun! Look! You even have a wingman best friend called Dokja. // Yoo Jonghyuk: Ah, that’s nice I guess. // (continue in replies)"
78,"Dec 15, 2021","Before I leave:/// Dokja: here's the plan- we sneak into the hall in matching black suits and then we- //Jonghyuk: matching? Why? That’s so coupley and gross. //
Dokja: o-oh…ye-yeah totally gross ;-; //
Sooyoung: y’all were fucking assassinating someone SERIOUSLY-"
78,"Dec 15, 2021","Dokja: *sends a super low-quality image of Jonghyuk to the group chat* //notaplagiarist: If I had a dollar for every pixel in this image, I’d have 15 cents //
depressosunfish: If I had a dollar for every ounce of rage I felt in my body after I read this text, I would have enough money to buy a cannon to fire at you //
Sangah: Actually I did the math, Sooyoung would have $225, not $0.15. //
notaplagiarist: Well who cares about the specifics.... // [continue in replies]"
78,"Dec 15, 2021",This whole episode has helped me derive great inspiration and motivated me to write 3 long fanfics about these two just bickering till there's a literal catastrophe to put a stop to it.
78,"Dec 15, 2021","Han Sooyoung: WAIT SANGAH! PLEASE DON’T LOOK AT MY LAPTOP! //Yoo Sangah: Why? //
Han Sooyoung: I’m… an adult. And I do… adult things on there… //

Sooyoung, slamming the laptop down: WHICH DISNEY PRINCESS I AM IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!"
78,"Dec 16, 2021","Translation mistake “Junghyeok Yu: Just one punch” should be Dokja speaking. Junghyeok says he’ll get him back for hitting him, and Dokja’s saying just one punch.
Also why was Way of the Wind changed to Path of Wind?"
78,"Mar 12, 2022",i just know theyre gonna be bffs sooner or later
78,"Dec 31, 2021",I'm starting to ship them seriously
78,"Dec 29, 2021",our main ship is sailing very smoothly *muahhhh*
78,"Dec 27, 2021","""Just one punch okay? Go easy on me"" Should be changed to Dokja, seems like another mistranslation."
78,"Dec 25, 2021",im looking forward for the two main character! 
78,"Dec 23, 2021",i wouldn't mind getting triple teamed by our lovely plagiarist if you know what i mean
78,"Dec 18, 2021","This is supposed to be the official translation, why so many changes? Like I already don't like when they change the King of No Killing and King of the Kingless Word... It kinda ruins the story since names like those are important details. Please don't change more than you did already because I'm scared that the iconic demon king◼️◼️ or ◼️◼️ Company will be changed. Like at least choose cooler and more fitting alternatives if you need to change the translation. "
78,"Dec 17, 2021",No one understood him and no one will... But Dokja could be the one to change that... This is making me emotional...
78,"Dec 17, 2021",Ahhhh I binged in 24 hours to get here and I’m so ready for the next chapter 😭💖💖💖💖 amazingly well done! The story is so deeply well connected yet not overwhelming! 
78,"Dec 17, 2021",this is so cool bruh having two main characters is shbgshdfbsd so fucking funny
78,"Dec 17, 2021","I ship dokja and junghyeok, lmaooo"
78,"Dec 16, 2021",Junghyeok surely needed someone like dokja in his journey as a companion
78,"Dec 16, 2021",OMGG SANGAAAHHH WE MISSED YOUUUU also can I just say that the art in this episode is just 😌👌👌 artist's kiss
78,"Dec 16, 2021",Must be extremely awkward to know someone so well as a character and then having to have a conversation with them in real life without being able to explain how you know all that stuff
78,"Dec 16, 2021","Yoo Sangah *after meeting Sooyoung for the first time* : Um, Dokja, Don't you think Sooyoung is a bit mean? //
Dokja: You'll get used to it. //

Yoo Sangah *after interacting with Sooyoung for the 143rd time* : Sooyoung told me to 'go to hell stupid pretty-face'. It could only mean she can't find her stash of lemon candies. //

Dokja, eating lemon candies in the corner: wut?"
78,"Dec 16, 2021",isnt dokja supposed to say the “just one punch” line when they were talking im the midday tryst

78,"Dec 15, 2021",the way the avatars are made is pretty cool
78,"Dec 15, 2021","I hate how hard it is to not ship these two. Like, you can't tell me you don't see some shounen ai vibes at least (especially if you've read the novel)."
78,"Dec 15, 2021",Man the art is top tier wow 
78,"Dec 15, 2021",Jung Huiwon: So... is this thing between Dokja and Jonghyuk supposed to be a secret? //Han Sooyoung: Hardly. The only people who don't know about Dokja and Jonghyuk are Dokja and Jonghyuk.

78,"Dec 15, 2021",Spider Sangah - Spider Sangah - Does whatever a Spider Sangah does
78,"Dec 10, 2021",I’m dead 💀 Whenever Dokja and Junghyeok talk I laugh so much. They’re hilarious. Dokja doesn’t really care to censor himself despite knowing Junghyeok is a hot headed angry child and it’s so funny seeing their reactions 😂
78,"Nov 10, 2021",Finally Yoo Sangah!! 
78,"Nov 10, 2021","Yknow that moment when you were a kid and you tell your parent that you can’t do it, yeah, that’s it."

78,"Jul 30, 2022",idk if I just hallucinating or Dokja talking about Seolhwa and Junghyeok have a little bit bitter spite 
78,"Jul 22, 2022",they're like old married couples
78,"Jul 13, 2022",so our mcs gays 
78,"Jul 4, 2022",There has been a wrong tipo in the part where Dokja says that YJH could punch him just one time
78,"Jul 4, 2022","This series has become funnier and funnier during this arc, the author has a great grasp on comedy."
78,"Jun 24, 2022",mom and dad are arguing
78,"May 20, 2022",I can't be the only one who thought of flowey when I saw that flower with an eye
78,"May 7, 2022","I just realized something, Jungheok is probably very mean at this stage of the story because it is still very early in the novel, and therefore early on in his character arc. After dozens of regressions he probably becomes more heroic and altruistic as he grows as a person from experiences."
78,"May 5, 2022",finally! I really miss his companions!
78,"Apr 30, 2022",every time i open the comments yall spell junghyeoks name 60 different times and its so funny

78,"Apr 3, 2022","Novel YJH: [It is one hit. I'll do it gently. Understood?]
[Just one punch, okay? You have to go easy on me.] But if that's the official translation here, it should have been Dokja's line."

78,"Jan 15, 2022","There is a mistake in the text, it's Dokja kim who says ""go easy on me"" when Yu is threatening to punch him"
78,"Jan 13, 2022",Lmao they were like the stereotypical comedic relief couple that's always arguing and being passive aggressive jjsjsjsjs

78,"Dec 18, 2021",Ok soooo why are the likes going down?  Don't forget to like the episodes people!!!
78,"Dec 18, 2021",That’s gotta sting having your lover from your previous regression try to kill you in this one 😭 poor guy. I wonder what happened that was so drastically different.
78,"Dec 18, 2021",Seems like spider man came just in time.
78,"Dec 17, 2021","Ayooo no, we don't want Junghyeok to have a lover alright?? I van just hear hearts breaking... the loudest one is mine 😭😭😭 AND THERE BETTER NOT BE A LOVER FOR DOKJA OR I WILL............ cry in a corner pathetically"

78,"Dec 15, 2021",I'm really worried for Dokja in the next round. He barely leveled up since fire dragon and he won that by a split of a hair. And his boytoy is out of commision to help tank throught and god know where's the rest of the party exept Sangan apparently being nearby. I know Dokja has plot armor but just because he can't die doesn't mean it won't hurt.

However, the other worlds are invading more quickly than anticipated based by Dokja Kim's comments by the plant monster and the hole in the sky.

78,"Dec 16, 2021","no bcs Junghyeok and Dokja are like brothers who argue all day but secretly care for each other sort of way. I know Junghyeok is not totally a likeable character, even Dokja is annoyed by him most of the time, but throughout the whole time Dokja was lonely and only relied on TWSA to get by, Junghyeok probably felt like his only friend that time. This is not the ideal reader meets the protagonist from their fave novel irl but I really like their interactions, especially in this one!"

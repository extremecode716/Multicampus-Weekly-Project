Episode,Date,Review
112,"Jul 6, 2022","before dokja collapse he's thinking of his kids, waaaah😭😭😭"
112,"Jul 6, 2022",Dionysus taking ship matters into his own hands 
112,"Jul 6, 2022","Dionysus. God of wine, revelry, and... matchmaking?"
112,"Jul 6, 2022","Imagine being a god and deciding to wingman a mere mortal, and that mortal just blows it. Dokja sure is dense. Wheeze."
112,"Jul 6, 2022","mama Persephone and daddy hades are coming, I'm excited 😆😆"
112,"Jul 6, 2022","Ah, Dionysus. If you wish to submit a complaint about how frustrating our Dokja can be, please take a number and stand in that very long line over there... 😏 And meanwhile, an important question: does this side trip qualify for Dokja's death tally count, or not?? 🤔"
112,"Jul 6, 2022",It's so improbable that someone would want to kiss Dokja that it almost summons an outer god? Damn.
112,"Jul 6, 2022","FYI Dionysus is talking about Orpheus who played his lyre, attracting Hades. Hades told Orpheus that he could take his wife, Eurydice back with him but under one condition: she would have to follow behind him while walking out from the caves of the underworld, and he could not turn back to look at her as they walked. He ended up looking back at the last moment which led to him failing in bringing Eurydice back to life."
112,"Jul 6, 2022","So 2 things.1. Never expected that Dionysus is that hot
2. As I read the Novel for the first time I never noticed how early on Dokja didn't feel like something good can happen to him, its so tragic and sad"
112,"Jul 6, 2022","Uhm..how about *pushes Dokja aside* we drink instead, Yoo Sangah-ssi 🛐🥀"
112,"Jul 6, 2022","Fyi, based on a much informative translation from somewhere else (yes, I said what I said. I'm only reading here to support the series), the notes Dionysus were singing is written by a man dedicated to his female friend to commemorate their platonic relationship. Take that as you will ig 🤷‍♂️"
112,"Jul 6, 2022",Dionysus really said: kiss kiss & fall in love. Also Dokja maybe it could happen to you man. You're handsome. 
112,"Jul 6, 2022","Dionysus really out here trying to start a shipping war amongst the watching constellations. A good chunk already think he and JHY are together, so I can only imagine what the chats looked like when Sangah was sitting so close. Also, a parallel to Orpheus and Eurydice, let's GOOOOOOOO. I feel like Hades is either going to LOVE or LOATHE our boy Dokja. "
112,"Jul 6, 2022","MOMMY PERSEPHONE, HERE WE GOOO"
112,"Jul 7, 2022","Tbh I don't really ship dokja with anyone 🤷, I just picture him as a single father with two kids💓 , that he deeply cared about 💞"
112,"Jul 6, 2022","One drink with a booze god and he's out, what a light weight Dokja"
112,"Jul 6, 2022",Dionysus trying to break into the domain of the sea God to keep the ship afloat.
112,"Jul 6, 2022",Ah so he’s doing an Orpheus 
112,"Aug 10, 2022","people complaining about their DokSang moment being ruined because they didn't kiss,,,,,, My Siblings In Sin, i don't even ship them but even i can see that the fact that Dokja isn't taking advantage of Sangah when drunk is a point FOR the ship, not AGAINST"
112,"Jul 6, 2022","[Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" would like to quote Sheldon Cooper, ' Wine and a girl in the dark. He's going to be bored out of his mind.' 5 coins have been sponsored.]"
112,"Jul 6, 2022",Dokja was got hit with the “Wake up to reality” treatment
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Dokja: rip to Orpheus but I'm different
112,"Jul 6, 2022","he either tryin to rob hades, make a deal, or get a supporting constellation."
112,"Jul 6, 2022","Oh shit this is getting interesting. I love how he said ""I like rude humans"" lol "
112,"Jul 6, 2022","It’s really fun that they took that dive into the complications with the story of Dionysus, the YouTube series “Overly Sarcastic Productions” has a super concise and engaging video on the topic which tl;dw the figure of Dionysus predates most of the Greek gods and his cult was so messy and rejected that most of what we know now comes in fragments and hopeful guessing"
112,"Jul 6, 2022",UNDERWORLD ARC ALREADY?? YALL KNOW WHO'S COMING NEXT 😍😍
112,"Jul 6, 2022",can't wait to see what kind of Hades we get to see. I enjoy all interpretations of the place and the god
112,"Jul 6, 2022",I CHOKED when he was saying Persephone is the mother. My mom had to ask if I was okay😭🤣
112,"Jul 6, 2022","I mean, once he's sober can he really Kiss her a drunk woman. thats not right "
112,"Aug 10, 2022","Ok, I just wanna say that Dokja not taking advantage of Sangah and kissing her while drunk is very commendable🥹"
112,"Jul 6, 2022",Persephone 😍
112,"Jul 6, 2022","Oh my! I often forget that Zagreus and Dionysius are the same figure, depending on the source! I really like the twist!"
112,"Jul 6, 2022",Not Dokja thinking he can't get game 💀💀💀
112,"Aug 10, 2022","DIONYSUS: NOW, KISS.FOURTH WALL: NOT IN MY PRESENCE"
112,"Jul 6, 2022",Time to meet an edgy teen next chapter 😂
112,"Jul 6, 2022",light weight huh. Dionysus making things interesting.
112,"Aug 10, 2022","Although I ship a different ship, I’ll say that Kim Dokja and Yu Sangah would be in such an adorable and sweet relationship and they could’ve been one had there not been an apocalypse and they just continued their office life (although it would also mean it would’ve been the end for WoS/TWSA in which we won’t know what Kim Dokja might do then 🥲). All that matters to me is having Kim Dokja get the love he deserves. ♡♡"
112,"Jul 6, 2022",Aah Dokja being sober and stop Sangah.. Best husband material indeed.. 
112,"Aug 10, 2022","""This can't happen to a guy like me"" Sure, let's say that monsters, demons, superpowers and magic are all perfectly logical and acceptable, but a girl falling in love with him? Nah, that's where we draw the line!"
112,"Jul 6, 2022",id let persephone hit tbh damn
112,"Aug 10, 2022","I'm not sure if people understood what Dionysus was trying to do at the start... It wasn't about ""shipping"" because that intells a relationship which is not what he wanted to watch. . ."
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Lore Olympus readers: I'm gonna pretend I didn't read that
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Growing up reading Percy Jackson it's really weird to see Dionysus this hot 
112,"Aug 10, 2022","Soooo…. Are we going to get myth accurate hades who is literally the most chill out of all Olympian gods?  Like literally, the only time he does something is if it’s someone trying to mess with this relationship to his wife. "
112,"Aug 8, 2022",I NEED SOME MORE DOKJA X SANGAH 😭😭
112,"Jul 7, 2022","lol Dokja and Yoo Sangah with their near kiss experience💀also, Gilyoung and Yoosung's cute•3•"
112,"Aug 17, 2022",orv doing straight baiting 😭😂😂😂
112,"Aug 10, 2022","THE ART IS PRETTY,DOKJA IS PRETTY,SANGAH IS  PRETTY,EVERYTHING IS SO PRETTYYY ASSJGDHGDSGHJKFD"
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Guys let's ensure this series maintains the  9.90 rating or increase it. This series deserves all the support 
112,"Aug 10, 2022",YES YES I LOVE IT WHEN MEN RESPECT WOMEN'S BOUNDARIES AND DON'T DO ANYTHING TO THEM WHEN THEY'RE DRUNK
112,"Jul 6, 2022",... Is that why we haven't seen him in Lore Olympus yet?
112,"Aug 12, 2022",Seeing how many comments are disappointed how he didn’t take advantage of a drunk girl makes me feel a little squicked out
112,"Aug 10, 2022",I'm sorry but as a percy jackson fan I cannot think of mr d as anything other than a middle aged alcoholic manhe cannot be hot

112,"Aug 17, 2022",Goddamn Kim Dokja is so fucking pretty 
112,"Aug 16, 2022","Not being funny but Dionysus can top me any day 🥴 He's a bit of a daddy, yes sir 🧎🏾‍♀️"
112,"Aug 13, 2022",Also Dokja being concerned for his kids is 😩💖
112,"Aug 11, 2022",I love the drawing of Persephone so much! I want it as a print 
112,"Aug 11, 2022",Dokja just cock blocked himself. ☠
112,"Aug 11, 2022","man yall simp almost as hard as dionysus, the horny drunk god"
112,"Aug 11, 2022","By the way if a person's supporting constellation has an afterlife associated with it, when that person dies they get to go to the afterlife. Like if your supporting constellation is an Archangel, you go to the christian heaven or hell, if it's an Egyptian god you go to either the Egyptian paradise or underworld, etc."
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Junghyuk in the bushes be like: *angry sunfish noises* 
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Can't wait for jealous arc Yoo Jonghyuk!! hehehe

112,"Aug 10, 2022",This chapter just came out on my birthday. Today is a good day.
112,"Aug 10, 2022","Percy Jackson, pt. 2?"
112,"Aug 10, 2022","The man who was very good with the lyre that Dionysus mentioned was probably Orpheus. He was a son of one of the muses of Apollo, and loved a woman named Eurydice. However Eurydice died, and Orpheus decided to go to the underworld to find her. There are a few different versions of how he got there, but it seems like here they’re going with the one where Dionysus showed him the way. Once in the underworld, Hades and Persephone found his lyre playing so lovely that they would allow him to leave 1/"
112,"Aug 10, 2022",kim dokja gay af fr
112,"Aug 18, 2022","Nice to see a ""myths are real"" story that acknowledges alternative versions of the myths exist!"
112,"Aug 17, 2022",Bruh Zeus really fucked everything and everyone lmao
112,"Aug 16, 2022","Dionysus is the god of pleasure and ecstasy, of course he would want to make them kiss"
112,"Aug 11, 2022",Dionysus is talking about orpheus and eurydice right?
112,"Aug 10, 2022","Dionysus, everyone Likes Dokja. Why would the Father of the Rich Night wouldn't like him? LOOOL Anyways, Good Luck Dokja! Comeback alive and with no scratch!"

112,"Aug 10, 2022",Ngl all of the music notes looked kinda sus
112,"Sep 21, 2022",Dionysus comparing Dokja to Achilles: 🏳️‍🌈
112,"Aug 17, 2022","sorry, i only see them as platonic relationship ><"
112,"Aug 17, 2022","as someone who loves Greek mythology this chapter was so fun. the random, unnecessary but fun line about the person with the lyre - I'm guessing Orpheus - honestly made my day so much"
112,"Aug 16, 2022",dionysus was litterally all of us when he said 'you've spoiled the fun.' 😂

112,"Aug 15, 2022",I'm ok with Dokja not kissing Sangah coz they are both drunk and irrational buuuuuuuuut Dokja thinking no one will ever want to kiss him!!!! That's just sad
112,"Aug 14, 2022",📸 📸 📸 that was a moment right there mhm 📸 📸 📸 
112,"Aug 13, 2022",My Greek mythology loving ass is here for this plot 😍 
112,"Aug 12, 2022","""I like rude humans"" 💀"
112,"Aug 11, 2022","it's the way, hades was shown young but zeus was this old white bearded man 😂😂😂     also I can't go along with this I know in this it makes sense but like zeus had a child with his sister who is persephone and to even think about the myth that zeus had a child with his own daughter, who is married to his brother who is technically her uncle, oh i just cant with Greek mythology, I love this books but why but dojka is so hot in this tho, like lord have mercy"
112,"Aug 11, 2022","Oh my goodness, this is gonna be so cool! I love the Greek myths, and I can't wait to see what's gonna happen."
112,"Aug 11, 2022",goddamn I need money for the new episode I'm too desperate

112,"Aug 10, 2022",dokja’s flushed face is so cute 
112,"Aug 10, 2022",DIONYSUS LOOKS SOOO GOOD! 🍇 
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Damn Mr. D got hard-core 
112,"Aug 10, 2022",I never knew about the version of being Persephone's son.. this should be interesting 
112,"Jul 13, 2022",Mr. Dokja Kim can you please scoot over so I can sit with Sangah? PLS
112,"Jul 12, 2022",I THOUGHT THIS WAS A FINISHED SERIES. NOW I HAVE TO WAIT 😫😫😫❤️❤️❤️
112,"Jul 10, 2022",DAADY HADES AND MOMMY PERSEPHONE ARE COMING AAAAAHHH
112,"Jul 8, 2022","[Constellation, Horn of the Ram, is ecstatic to view the Underworld. 5 coins have been gifted.]"
112,"Jul 6, 2022",OH MY GOD. SHOULDER TO SHOULDER.
112,"Aug 10, 2022",idc abt what you guys say but Dokja X Sangah is a cute ship 
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Dokja can u stop being pretty you supposed to be ugly
112,"Aug 10, 2022",well from what I read in lore Olympus they're pretty nice people 😂😂
112,"Oct 6, 2022",Lore Olympus X Omniscient Reader crossover! 
112,"Sep 28, 2022","I like that they incorporated Greek mythology, and not clumsily either. Dionysus in several legends tricked his victims into drinking until they fell unconscious, such as when he r8p3d Aura. they also mention Orpheus (""he was good with a lyre, too""), which is a fun easter egg. "
112,"Aug 30, 2022","Sorry to break it to you but Dokja is gay and Sangah is a lesbian and she's dating Sooyoung, it's true because I said so <3"
112,"Aug 17, 2022","If he gets stuck there forever and somehow manages to come back after ages, will that mean he'll come as a catastrophe?"
112,"Aug 16, 2022",let’s not forget that Persephone also happens to be Zeus’s daughter 😀👍
112,"Aug 16, 2022",omg yes Dionysus is hot finally as he should
112,"Aug 15, 2022","His real mother is Semele, it’s considered a legend for it to be Persephone and is less likely and believed. But whatever guess we’re going with the false route because it’s more entertaining. Dionysus true mother is Semele."
112,"Aug 15, 2022",nooo I've caught up 
112,"Aug 15, 2022",i'm proud of dokja for not feeling like a mc
112,"Aug 15, 2022",dionysus kinda hot
112,"Aug 14, 2022",NOOOO SHIPPERS ARE COMING IN
112,"Aug 13, 2022",This needs to be a game or a game that uses this webtoons structure
112,"Aug 12, 2022",Has anyone read Percy Jackson? If so I hope I wasn't the only thinking of Mr. D as a fat jolly guy.
112,"Aug 11, 2022","haha well, hades liked dokja from the beginning though 😌"
112,"Aug 11, 2022","Diyonisus' mother being Persephone isn't a real part of that myth, btw. She's not always human or a princess, but his mother is always Semele. Fun facts tho: A lesser known part of Diyonisus' origins is that he was ""raised as a girl"", sometimes to protect him from Hera, and sometimes with no reasoning. He's also the reason dolphins exist, and why they're a**holes, and its because they're pirates that tried to kidnap him thinking he was just a really pretty human girl. "
112,"Aug 11, 2022","just a little moreeeeeee, i love this arc so much💕, you will love it when we get there, just wait"
112,"Aug 11, 2022","I mean, with the gods of Olympus the answer can be Both.  Zagreus Dionysus is an aspect we know little of"
112,"Aug 11, 2022",Hades!!! I wonder what this version will be like. also I'm learning so much about Greek lore. son of Zeus and persephone 😱. I wonder if lore Olympus will touch on this ooooooo 
112,"Aug 11, 2022",i've always loved greek myths but i really don't know that vertion. espesially since Persephone (before marriage) was known as Kore and daughter of Zeus and Demeter
112,"Aug 11, 2022",MOMMY PERSEPHONE SOON 😭😭😭😭
112,"Aug 11, 2022",I guess he refered to the faun in midas's story...
112,"Aug 11, 2022","Being Hades town my favourite musical, my heart can't take the ""he was good with the lyre""."
112,"Aug 11, 2022",this is a very well written story it’s actually insane 
112,"Aug 11, 2022",dionysus is the tinder of the new era
112,"Aug 10, 2022",I can't wait for the garter belt incident😂
112,"Aug 10, 2022",I’m 90% sure that the song Dionysus was humming was “kiss the girl” from the Little Mermaid 😂😂
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Ahhhh I cant wait for Dokja to meet the king and queen of the underworld 🫶🏻 and I cant wait for everything to unfold in this arc 🥹
112,"Aug 10, 2022",I know the Greeks were wild but it does hurt that Persephone would betray Hades with Zeus. I can't believe it but here's hoping it goes better for Dokja than it did for Orpheus 
112,"Aug 10, 2022","dont ever forget when dealing with dionysus that hes also the god of madness... be careful when aproaching him, in one moment he can laugh with you, the next you are a dolphin..."
112,"Aug 10, 2022",the father of the rich nights ahem when ahem
112,"Aug 10, 2022","I've always thought Dionysus would look a bit different (kinda like Phil from Disney's ""Hercules"", I have no idea why), but it's interesting to see this interpretation of his character. Can't wait to see what Persephone and Hades look like!! "
112,"Aug 10, 2022",this should be an illegal ending. I desperately need moreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
112,"Aug 10, 2022","Dionysus was essentially sayin ""But I like to waaaaaatch"""
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Hades players be like: 😊
112,"Jul 6, 2022","God of Wine, Fertility, and apparently trolls. "
112,"Jul 6, 2022","wait I'm already obsessed with this story, no way I can handle a reference to Orpheus??? seriously, now I worship this story and the author 🙇🏼‍♂️🙇🏼‍♂️also Dokja is Daddy, but Mommy Persephone is a literal goddess so I'm experiencing major bi-panic🤷"
112,"Jul 6, 2022","YAAAAASSS finally going to the underworld!! finally gonna see (spoilers), reading it was amazing though."
112,"Jul 6, 2022",Man I spent too many coins today
112,"Jul 6, 2022",TO THE UNDERWORLD WE GO🎉🎉🎉🎉
112,"Jul 6, 2022",DID HE DIE?? LMAO
112,"Jul 6, 2022",Next week we'll get to see how our boy Dokja manages to swindle Hades
112,"Aug 10, 2022","Hades from Lore Olympus: ""ZEUS WHATHAFU-@DX%WB!?!?"""

112,"Sep 23, 2022",dam it that should have been me not him 
112,"Sep 21, 2022","Dionysus a shipper too huh? why do people ship characters so much, especially those who aren't even remotely attracted."
112,"Sep 20, 2022",As the viewer count fades off like twsa 😭
112,"Sep 17, 2022",WOW this is so cool!!! Good luck Dokja!!!
112,"Sep 15, 2022",Horny dokja needs bonking
112,"Sep 14, 2022",I scrolled all the way to the bottom and skipped the chapter to ask: HOW DID THE PEOPLE IN AIRPLANES SURVIVE? DID THEY SURVIVE? WHERE ARE THEY NOW?! 
112,"Sep 14, 2022","When Dionysus said someone reckless with a lyre, I thought of Venti 😭😭😭😭"
112,"Aug 30, 2022",Wasn't expecting Dionysus ro look so fine...he sounds like he'd be a chaos gremlin tho 😭😭
112,"Aug 18, 2022",Oh he will like him
112,"Aug 18, 2022","though I think it's the author's choice, I personally think the dokja and sangha shouldn't end up together, it would just feel unnatural and pushed."
112,"Aug 18, 2022","ahh, so that's why Dionysus referred to Zagreus as his brother in Hades"
112,"Aug 17, 2022","I really like how they threw in the story about Persephone being Dionysus's mother. in fact, it's true. Anyone ever heard of Zagreus?"
112,"Aug 16, 2022",WAAAAAH IM TOO BROKE... I spent too much alreadyyyyy nooooo!!!!
112,"Aug 15, 2022",I love this series!!! I’ve come back to read it at least 2-3 a month since it first started from start to newest! Thank you for being my “AUTHOR”!!! And I will continue to read!!!

112,"Aug 13, 2022",Good on you Dokja for getting sober 😤👍👍
112,"Aug 13, 2022",I'm forever going to think that Persephone is the mother of Dionysus.
112,"Aug 13, 2022",I love Dionysus’s comparison between Dokja and Orpheus! I can definitely see the resemblance. I wonder if he’ll go through a similar challenge?
112,"Aug 13, 2022",Thinking of Persephone and Hades makes me cry. I miss them.
112,"Aug 13, 2022","was the human that was ""good with the lyre"" orpheus? Its gotta be, right?"
112,"Aug 12, 2022",Imagine going to hell
112,"Aug 12, 2022",Dokja about to have a katabasis.
112,"Aug 12, 2022","Personally, it think it would have been if they tried to summon Hermes, seeing as he’s a guide for Underworld souls."
112,"Aug 12, 2022","A journey to the underworld is a interesting ordeal, and having your body drunk to make the passage even more interesting."
112,"Aug 12, 2022","the other human Dionysus is talking about is Orpheus (I think). Orpheus wanted to bring back his lover/wife from Hades, but was ultimately unsuccessful and had to go home empty-handed."
112,"Aug 12, 2022",DAMMIT IM CAUGHT UP
112,"Aug 11, 2022","[Another God of Navel Conquest arises from the bottle]                    Also, I KNOW Hades is gonna love ya boi Dokja.

112,"Aug 11, 2022","WHY AM I ALWAYS LATE 😭😭😭 but this! chapter! The art is as stunning as always, and the plot is progressing nicely! of COURSE Dokja's a lightweight 💀 we see more of what the effects of the Fourth Wall can to support him, which is interesting as always. AND DIONYSUS!!! It's so satisfying to see how the plot weaves together. See y'all next week!!! <3"
112,"Aug 11, 2022","Dionysius enjoys some greek drama, it seens."

112,"Aug 10, 2022",Dokja is taking on the role of the hero. According to Joseph Campbell one requirement for a hero is a trip through the Underworld.

112,"Aug 10, 2022","As somebody who's been getting into Greek mythology lately, I can't wait for how they interpret the Greek Gods, I hope they're Atleast accurate to the original. Unlike SOME Movies... Screw you, Percy Jackson movies "

112,"Aug 10, 2022","A group of humans descended to the Underworld, there they shall find a long lost 'companion'.

112,"Aug 10, 2022","i need some Olympus expert for explanation, if the persephone as his mother true, the who's the father? I'm assuming it's not hades since dionysus said he doesn't like him"
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Dokja saying he doesn't believe he deserves something special could happen to him breaks my heart every time 
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Choked on my drink seeing Dionysus visuals. 
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Oh boy I can't wait to see what Hades and the crew actually look like!

112,"Aug 10, 2022","I love how Dionysus communicates, looks, and talks in this! The liquor shifting shapes, the fact that he likes rude humans, the matchmaking! So fun!"

112,"Aug 14, 2022",he looks like the guy from solo leveling 
112,"Aug 14, 2022",I think there's also a version where Dionysus is the great grandson of Aphrodite (Aphrodite and Ares birthed Harmona and Harmona's daughter birthed Dionysus?) been a while since I've read up on my myths. I'm loving this storyline 😍😭😍
112,"Aug 13, 2022",Adding this to my Kubera and Tower of God collection of god-tier epic webtoons 
112,"Aug 13, 2022",... That's not the Dionysus I know

112,"Aug 13, 2022",dokja being your typical reader thinking he ain't got rhythm 
112,"Aug 12, 2022",I haven't reached this part in the novel but did the part with sangah happen or is this just a webtoon thing??
112,"Aug 12, 2022",dang so Dionysus technically just killed him
112,"Aug 12, 2022",i think dokja rlly thinks he’s the ugliest person out there 😆

112,"Aug 12, 2022","Hey, Zag man"
112,"Aug 12, 2022",when he talked about the guy with the lyre he was talking about the legend of Orpheus. he went into hades (the place) to get his wife but failed and became the court minstrel for hades (the god)

112,"Aug 11, 2022",rip to Orpheus but I'm different -Dokja
112,"Aug 11, 2022","(sorry for the grammar errors I'm still learning the language) thank God that kiss didn't happen, for who like this ship don't hate me in the coments just don't read, all sorted; they really don't have quemestry (or quimic dunno) like they rarely talked and when they talked was just convenient at the time, he really don't have a strong bond with anyone for what I saw but I still have the hope kim dokja stays with Jun geoun(I don't know how to write his name and I'm lazy to look) well bye!

112,"Aug 10, 2022",Very intrigued to learn why Dokja wants to get in touch with Persephone that bad. 
112,"Aug 10, 2022",i think Dionysus is talking about Orpheus. This is what Hadestown has prepared me for
112,"Aug 10, 2022",horny god
112,"Aug 10, 2022",what in the straight baiting is this Dionysus 🤨🤨🤨🤨
112,"Aug 10, 2022",nope..no...I cannot...I refuse to believe that kore had sexual relations with Zeus

112,"Aug 10, 2022","a little birdie passing byyyyyy , looking at the 'maybe' people who would've kissed,,,,ahhhh can't wait till the reveal 🤭"
112,"Aug 10, 2022",HADES :DDD (congrats on chapter 111!)
112,"Aug 10, 2022",The way he mentioned Orpheus😭😭
112,"Aug 10, 2022",then zesus slapped dionysus into his thigh
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Greek mythology predicted amogus
112,"Aug 10, 2022","the mindset tho. ""there's no way something like this is happening to me"""
112,"Aug 10, 2022",you have spoiled the fun - he literally has
112,"Aug 10, 2022", MAY I REMIND YOU THAT PERSEPHONE IS THE DAUGHTER OF ZEUS?
112,"Aug 10, 2022","Imagine if Dokja’s soul wakes up in the Underworld still drunk 😂 also, everyone is gonna be freaking out about this… ahhh I’m so curious what’s gonna happen! (No spoilers please)"
112,"Aug 10, 2022",i though dionysius would be... you know.. fat? @aren't all of his iconography like that
112,"Aug 10, 2022","I could have sworn she was Zeus’s daughter and I found this. Quoting by the way 😅 from Britannica, “Zagreus, in Orphic myth, a divine child who was the son of Zeus (as a snake) and his daughter Persephone. Zeus intended to make Zagreus his heir and bestow on him unlimited power, but Hera out of jealousy urged the Titans to attack the child while she beguiled him with toys.” Take it as you well but this remained me of all the incest that goes on. ;-; depending on the myth "
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Kim Dokja's only love is coming...🤣
112,"Aug 10, 2022","""It'll be difderent for me"" "" then I'll be the first"", why do these sound so similiar...."

112,"Aug 10, 2022",Us readers are like Dionysus trynna ship Dokja and Sanghan
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Mr. D!
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Everytime I read this novel I know deep in my heart that if I get into this world I wouldn't remember this comic well enough like dokja
112,"Aug 10, 2022",i normally hate dionysus but he looks so fine here 😭
112,"Aug 10, 2022","More importantly God of plays and of the uknown and parts of mind one cannot control. So glad he's not portrayed as the cliche we usually see, typically like in Fantasia... Dionysus is the divine fire incarnate, the wolf, he is as dangerous as he is necessary. "
112,"Aug 10, 2022",I guess I'm still in love with greek mythology characters because it'a not even a proper whole face but I swooned with Dionysus *facepalm* but anyways Dokja ia really a good father huh
112,"Aug 10, 2022",I love that I get to learn about a different version or style or theory from this series.
112,"Aug 10, 2022",I-... Would kiss Dokja too lmao (no I am not weird okay?)🤣
112,"Aug 10, 2022",The fourth wall made him sober at a wrong time

112,"Aug 10, 2022","Hades won’t only took a liking to him, that pair Underworld couple would love him so much"
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Whoa!! Okay - this just got serious. (As if it wasn't already.)
112,"Aug 10, 2022",That's not the pudgy fat dude from Percy Jackson :/
112,"Aug 10, 2022",New name for Dionysus God of Shipcraft
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Yu Junghyeok be like:🧍‍♂️
112,"Aug 10, 2022","lol it's episode 111, chapter 22, three promises, and part 4...

1, 2, 3, 4"
112,"Aug 10, 2022","""I hope that Father of the Richest Night take a liking to you"". Of course he will😏 Only some arrogant and annoying constellations doesn't like Dokja"
112,"Aug 10, 2022",papa hades is coming :D
112,"Aug 10, 2022","When I read lyre, I immediately thought of Achilles and the book Song Of Achilles"
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Yikes.  Did he go to you know where!?
112,"Aug 10, 2022",To the underworld!
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Underworld coming soon

112,"Aug 10, 2022","Oh heck yeah, Hades and Persephone time. Love those two, they're great."
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Dionysus is pretty decent
112,"Aug 10, 2022",DAMN FOURTH WALL IT'S JUST A LITTLE PUSH
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Dokja just got cockblocked by his own skill. I love that the God's reaction was prolly all of ours too 
112,"Aug 10, 2022",LMAO
112,"Aug 10, 2022",the illustrations of dionysus and persephone are very beautiful 😍😍😍✨
112,"Aug 10, 2022","The dionysus drawing was f-ing extatic, i stared at it for at least a minute"
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Dionysus is so pretty—
112,"Aug 10, 2022",The Lore Olympus fans have been summoned.
112,"Aug 10, 2022","Let's all thank the convenience of ""The Fourth Wall"" for stopping Dokja before something else happened"
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Ok but I can’t get over how cute dokja is blushing 😭💘💘💘
112,"Aug 10, 2022",GOODBYE WHY YALL SI FAST AT COMMENTING
112,"Aug 10, 2022","""And the other is the version in which his mother is Persephone, wife of Hades"" wait wait wait, but I thought Persephone was Zeus's daughter?! "
112,"Aug 10, 2022",even dionysus wants the ship to happen lol
112,"Aug 10, 2022","the entire time I was reading the web novel, I always pictured Dionysus as some burly alcoholic guy like from Percy Jackson. SO WHAT I SAW TOTALLY CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD"
112,"Aug 10, 2022",I’ve never heard the version where Persephone mothered Dionysus. Every version I heard has Persephone as Zeus’s daughter and childless. Has anyone else heard this version?
112,"Aug 8, 2022",Dokja and Sangah remind me so much of Kirito and Asuna 😭❤

112,"Sep 11, 2022",OHHHHHHHHH YEAH I FORGOT!!!!! I was super confused for a second because if Zeus is Dionysus' father and if Persephone was his mother that meant Zues raped his daughter? Right? (Not that I'm shocked) Than I remembered there is a myth where Zues pretends to be his brother Hades to sleep with Persephone and thats how Dionysus came to be but in another version he is indeed Hades' kid. 
112,"Sep 10, 2022",i read it lately thoo
112,"Sep 10, 2022","""i hope that Father of the rich night takes a liking to you"" this is the man who 1. has refused to die and 2. is going to take a soul from the labyrinth through him i do not think hades will be happy"

112,"Sep 1, 2022",Hmmm how would Persephone could be the mother of dionisyus if the father kills her? Doesn't make sense... I think... It would make war between Zeus and Hades
112,"Sep 1, 2022",Sussy Dionysussy baka

112,"Aug 24, 2022","I didn't know about the Persephone one, I do know that in the former he finishes maturing into a baby in his father's leg, I'm sure someone in the replies will note what leg really means"
112,"Aug 24, 2022",I want the kiss😭😭😭
112,"Aug 24, 2022",Can we just acknowledge that folks sobered up because he knew situations like that never happen to him?
112,"Aug 24, 2022",It was god of wine and ecstasy in the novel ? And I totally forgot that Dionysus was actually someone powerful cuz our boi Dokja gonna get wayy more powerful than him 😂
112,"Aug 24, 2022",are u sure there's not a third version with aphrodite as dionysus's mother 🧐
112,"Aug 24, 2022",Orphic Dionysus is a bit more intense than what people usually expect from the god of getting drunk.
112,"Aug 24, 2022",jungyheok wishes that was him 🤭 
112,"Aug 23, 2022","BROTHERSDOJKA AND DIONYSUS

112,"Aug 22, 2022","As a Greek person it's really interesting to see how others imagine the Greek gods. and I like seeing Greek mythology in foreign works, especially when it's correct and respectful. the author has been doing a great job so far!"
112,"Aug 22, 2022","Ngl I like this scenes because they are a funny part of the story xD but I'm kinda mad they didn't get rid of these like the ones between Dokja and Junghyeok, I mean this is also bait xD because Dokja won't end up with sangah, as I said before it was just an homophobic thing to do"
112,"Aug 22, 2022","a good depiction of Dionysus, slightly sinister. I also appreciate the mention of more than one myth of how Dionysus came to be."
112,"Aug 21, 2022",ik dionysus was probably referencing orpheus when he mentioned the lyre but it reminded me of achilles and now im SAD
112,"Aug 21, 2022",Wow this is interesting or rather there is always some new excitement

112,"Aug 19, 2022","Fun Fact: the second myth is true and mich older, attributed to Orphic Dionysus who was worshipped by Orphic cults, named after Orpheus and were studying death and rebirth. This myth has a later variations errands the son as Zagreus, son of Hades. In Mycenean Greece, Hades wasn't in the myths and Dionysus was the son of Persephone and Poseidon, who in these versions was king of gods & god of the underworld. Our knowledge of these things are fairly fragmentary because Bronze Age collapse though."
112,"Aug 19, 2022",Dionysus out here trying to get my Boi laid 
112,"Aug 19, 2022",Nah cause I never imagined Dionysus to be this hot. I've always thought he looked like an old fat man

112,"Aug 10, 2022",why does Dionysus sounds likable and wholesome in my head while reading his lines😭😭
112,"Aug 10, 2022","there are multiple underworld/hell gods. do they all share a domain, or do they have specific domains of their own? do they ever argue who should punish which people?"
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Gonna start calling him Percy Jackson
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Who knew the alcohol god is a matchmaker too
112,"Aug 10, 2022","So he is going to have to get Hades on his side, in which I imagine there will be some Drama with Zeus' and Persephone's child being the one guiding Dokja."
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Sangah's alcohol resistance reminds me of a cousin of mine that can drink alcohol like it's water and keep going long after the rest of the family has given up

112,"Aug 10, 2022",so from what I know the second story is from Orphism where Dyonisus is also known as Zagreus and he was born of zeus and persephone.
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Hades will hate him
112,"Aug 10, 2022","Yes, let's hope so, the chances of him dying if not are... High"

112,"Aug 9, 2022",ack!! what happens next??? i'm curious😭😭😣
112,"Aug 9, 2022","I love these drawings of the Greek myths, they're so beautiful and literally golden. Poor Dokja though, he thinks he wouldn't ever have a romantic moment, when he literally has like a whole harem, plus the King of Beauty would definitely do that to him sober. He thinks Junghyuk will kill him even though he tried to avenge his death, too. "
112,"Aug 8, 2022",This episode was worth spending my five coins on 😌💙

112,"Jul 28, 2022",coins = down the drain
112,"Jul 26, 2022","so he was talking abt Orpheus and Eurydice about the lyre. That’s one sad story. In the version I like the most, Orpheus turns around the moment he steps out of the underworld, too ecstatic and impatient to see Eurydice, not realising that Eurydice is still not out of the Underworld. So she dies. How tragic."
112,"Jul 23, 2022","Dionysus, you naughty little GOD"
112,"Jul 23, 2022",AAAAAAAAH

112,"Jul 6, 2022","Dionysus is my favourite of the gods. not because of Greek mythology, but because of the crazy sex/wine cult he originated from. it was originally rejected by the Greek powers but eventually alot of major players in Athens became members and from there it became impossible for him not to be an Olympian."

112,"Sep 29, 2022",I love the Orpheus reference :)
112,"Aug 12, 2022","Damn, dokja really had to spoil the fun part like that"
112,"Aug 11, 2022","Another comment! A bit of a random tangent but I'm kind of disappointed with the amount of people relating this arc to other fiction, especially Lore Olympus. I don't exactly love Lore Olympus, so this might be a bit biased, but expecting a crossover between the 2 simply because they're both WEBTOONs is just. ugh. From what I remember, at no point do the storylines in either of them relate whatsoever, and it'd feel cheap and out of place to include it, even if just an Easter Egg."
112,"Aug 11, 2022",damn fourth wall! nerf this damned skill!
112,"Aug 11, 2022","Dionysus,why am I thinking of the BTS song?"

112,"Aug 10, 2022",oh dokja you have no idea how much i want to kiss you soo bad.
112,"Aug 10, 2022","Doh... They could have kissed each other... but i think it's better that way, because being drunk it's not good to this kind of things... it could have difficult their relationship... Sangah is so embarrassed"
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Dokja: wait there’s no way i’d ever be pulling bitches hold on
112,"Aug 10, 2022","You're forgetting the 3rd myth, where his parents aren't even gods, and he became a god simply because of the huge following he amassed. Or maybe I read too much percy jackson"
112,"Jul 7, 2022",DIONYSUS acting real SUS right now. Can’t be creating a ship this early in the scenario. We all know that the real ship is Dokja x Junghyeok.
112,"Jul 6, 2022",Oooo dokja is well versed in Lore….Olympus.  Maybe it’s time for a crossover!
112,"Jul 6, 2022",SANGAH HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE LIVING MY DREAM????!?? 
112,"Jul 6, 2022","Damn, not Dionysus trying to come in between Junghyeok and Dokja’s relationship, smh 🤦🏿‍♂️ "

112,"Aug 11, 2022","Hades is one of the good Greek Gods. He does his job, loves his wife and has a dog named Spot."

112,"Jul 6, 2022","I wish I could take shipping into my own hands, Some anime would be a lot less frustrating to watch"
112,"Aug 10, 2022","ShingShong literally so iconic for straight-baiting, gay-baiting, and then revealing that both Yoo Sangah and Kim Dokja never want to get married (i say this as a YHK enjoyer)"
112,"Sep 12, 2022",Dionysus said kiss kiss fall in love! 🤭
112,"Aug 15, 2022","

112,"Aug 10, 2022",damn Dokja... you will die a virgin...
112,"Aug 10, 2022",Will Dokja ever get into a relationship? I hate fantasy protagonists who can never see that someone is in love with them despite all their intelligence and smartness.

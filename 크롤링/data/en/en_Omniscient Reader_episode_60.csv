60,"Jul 7, 2021",Back off Jiwon Min! I was slightly attracted to Dokja first!
60,"Jul 7, 2021","Ahh, they found the golden frisbee of desolation! He who catches it in their mouth is an eternal good boy!"
60,"Jul 7, 2021",Is it me or is that dokaebi keeping a closer eye on Dokja?
60,"Jul 7, 2021",Epic fight scene AND a history lesson? They blended that well!
60,"Jul 7, 2021",And so the Harem continues to expand.
60,"Jul 7, 2021",I’m learning a lot of Korean history from this series. Makes me want to actually read up on it
60,"Jul 7, 2021","the Four Yin Demon Decapacitator has the official name of Four Tiger Evil Cutting Sword (check google arts and cultures) this sword is forged at the ""tiger"" hour day month and year, which is said to contain yang energy to fight off evil forces of yin. Thus ""Four Yin"" is wrong, plz fix 😔"

60,"Jul 7, 2021","seongguk's ""hehe"" what the heck.. pantsless moe man"
60,"Jul 7, 2021",Damn wish I got a notification every time someone was attracted to me 
60,"Jul 9, 2021","Im begging for this to be made into an anime, and I mean BEGGING. "
60,"Jul 7, 2021",Am I the only one that sometimes doesn’t really know what’s going on but still too interested in the series to care… No?.. That’s cool 😅
60,"Jul 7, 2021",Hahah his face when the system messages popped up xD he’s not having any of it xD his expression is literally like “ugh”
60,"Jul 7, 2021",Jiwon do be simping
60,"Jul 7, 2021",so now he has a queen with a strong personality? sounds like a good deal. he got the king beauty and that king with the internet as well as the old man. he will be king of kings soon
60,"Jul 7, 2021","I'm dying at the sudden shoujo manga panels, it's too good 😂😂 And ohhhhh man, this entire upcoming sequence is going to be SO good, I can't wait!"
60,"Jul 7, 2021", KDJ's impression of YJH is ✨✨✨✨
60,"Jul 7, 2021","This is to novel readers: I know that character hasn’t really shown up yet, but please don’t say anything that might spoil webtoon readers about them when they do show up."
60,"Jul 7, 2021",Jiwon's got that Ara~ Ara~ going right now 
60,"Jul 7, 2021",so is dokja building a harem
60,"Jul 13, 2021","Imagine the genres just switch and Dokja finds a new passion, to become a harem king using his knowledge of twsa"
60,"Jul 7, 2021","Love all the details put into this manga artwork,story and history lessons on point. 👌"
60,"Aug 12, 2021","I know a lot of people say that Sangah will 'get better later on', and I agree but like, she's not useless right now either, right? Her skills aren't very 'attack' or like 'battle' abilities at this point but like she hasn't brought the team down, and she literally just proved herself by leading that whole group of people at their station. And I can tell you that more people at the station probably would have died when the apostles/disciples attacked if she didn't form the teams and battle plans"
60,"Aug 11, 2021","As an asexual, I'm getting ace vibes from Dokja and I kinda dig it. A story like this doesn't need romantic subplots. It's very interesting already and I like seeing more friendships and other platonic dynamics in stories."
60,"Aug 11, 2021","Funny, the thing that threw Dokja off in this whole fucking apocalypse was the fact that the girl was attracted to him lol."
60,"Aug 11, 2021",Dokja's face when it says she's attracted to him is peak Aromantic energy- 
60,"Aug 11, 2021",is it just me or dokja is really attractive like how can't they see it👁️👄👁️ (except for that chick)
60,"Aug 11, 2021",*anyone other than yjh attracted to kdj* kdj: DISGUSTING
60,"Jul 7, 2021","Lmao can't believe KDJ imagined that YJH & MJW encounter in the ""shoujo style"", Sleepy-C drew that nicely tho. I still can't get over Dokja's face when it comes to Jiwon 😅. Also, can the wannabe actor please give back the tiddy belt back to Joonghyuk? Sangah was adorable when she found the relic & that throne looks much better than how I imagined~Tbh I'm enjoying the Korean historical parts of this story much more in the webtoon because it's easier to digest in a visual format as a non-Korean"
60,"Aug 11, 2021",JOONGHYUK ON THE SHOUJO PANELS I CAN'T- 
60,"Aug 11, 2021",It's like a part of him dies when he sees the notification from the system telling him that the queen lady is attracted to him.
60,"Aug 11, 2021",Does anyone else read TWSA as one word instead of saying each letter individually?? 😅
60,"Aug 12, 2021",Is this series just an elaborate cover-up to teach us Korean history? 👀
60,"Aug 11, 2021",Dokja needs to realize that everyone is actually just attracted to him 
60,"Jul 8, 2021",Dokja’s face of utter dissatisfaction. The vehement disgust. Fucking pFECTION. Jiwon has been awarded One Yike. 
60,"Aug 11, 2021",*someone attracted to him*a worst case scenario that he didnt expect
60,"Aug 11, 2021",anyone else forget he's just running around Seoul with no shirt😂
60,"Aug 12, 2021",I’d like to think Dokja would be happier if Junhyeok was slightly attracted to him
60,"Aug 11, 2021","""as you may know, Silla won the battle of hwangsanbeol"" Me that don't know Korean history: sure 🤡"
60,"Aug 11, 2021",Lol he has high standards (which probably includes joonghyuk 😏)
60,"Aug 11, 2021","y'all mightn't like this but Dokja not liking the girl makes me laugh so hard, he's got feelings for one person only and it's his man yjh"
60,"Aug 11, 2021",LOL DOKJA JUST DEADPAN STARING AT JIWON LIKE 'BISH YOU SERIOUS'. He's not even dense at this point. And can just imagine messages coming up in front of him about other people developing feelings for him and he's just like 'NOPE'.
60,"Aug 11, 2021",-jiwon is slightly attracted to you- *the most suprised/disgusted face ever*
60,"Aug 11, 2021",*character min jiwon is slightly attracted to you*meanwhile dokja: 😑
60,"Aug 11, 2021",Am I the only one who really wants to read Three Ways to Survive The Apocalypse?
60,"Aug 11, 2021",Am not Korean but it sure is nice to learn about Korean History from this webcomic lol
60,"Aug 11, 2021",since i'm really bad with names  i thought at first that the guy without pants Was the one who attracted to him
60,"Aug 12, 2021",I have a theory that the reason Dokja is so concerned about Jiwon liking him is that she was Junghyeok Yu's romantic partner (with whom he had a child) in a previous regression. Dokja is probably terrified that if he finds out he's going to be killed 😂 
60,"Aug 12, 2021",that one dude still has no pants 🤣
60,"Aug 11, 2021","Dokja: death will come for me sooner or later 

Readers of the novel: sh1t, it is starting  🥲"
60,"Aug 11, 2021","Aaahhhhhhhhh Idk why but after completing the novel, it feels as if I’m watching my children grow up idk how to explain it T_T"
60,"Aug 11, 2021","Dokja to Min Jiwon: ""I'm gay, keep scrolling"""
60,"Aug 11, 2021",alr but to be fair if junghyeok grabbed me like that too i would completely forget how to breathe
60,"Aug 17, 2021",Dokja has priorities and getting laid isnt one of them

60,"Aug 11, 2021","Ngl, Min Jiwon has good taste with men 😔👌✨"
60,"Aug 14, 2021",Jungheyok be grabbing people by collars at first meeting. What a man 👀
60,"Aug 12, 2021",DOKJA'S EYES WHEN HE READS THE MESSAGE ABOUT JIWON 😭😭
60,"Aug 12, 2021",petition for dokja to get his old clothes back because I'm sorry but I cannot take him seriously in that outfit 
60,"Aug 11, 2021","all things aside, with dokja's backpack and sneakers, the incarnations outfits, and them visiting temple and museums made them look like a bunch of theatre kids in a field trip rather than a bunch of people in a deadly scenario marching into battle 😂"
60,"Aug 11, 2021",OH NO SEONGGUK STILL RUNNING WITHOUT PANTS 😂😂😂
60,"Aug 11, 2021",Me: *isn't Korean *doesn't knows Korean history *is confused af *just proceeds to read as if I understand everything 👁️👁️

60,"Aug 12, 2021","wait if the system tells dokja jiwon attracted to him, does that mean that no one else is so far? T-T"

60,"Aug 11, 2021",- So it became Korean history lesson?- Always has been. 
60,"Aug 11, 2021",I have asthma and every time I read this webtoon it just gets worse help
60,"Aug 11, 2021","funny enough like commenter Eva said, Dokja ain't afraid of facing a fire breathing dragon,being almost killed a lot of times by characters of TWSA or non characters, fighting a mf T-Rex but he is certainly afraid or rather nervous of a masochistic queen crushing on him. that's relatable"
60,"Aug 11, 2021",dokja’s face when he realized jiwon was attracted to him has me wheezing on the ground
60,"Aug 11, 2021",And there is still a guy with no pants on...smh🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️

60,"Aug 12, 2021",i can't believe this poor man's still walking around in his underwear
60,"Aug 11, 2021", their attribute is” supporting actor” so that’s why they are so in-tune with their constellations. Actors can sympathize and react with the role they are given and the constellations use that to be in-tune with them
60,"Aug 11, 2021","YESYESYES, the throne is alredy here~"
60,"Sep 12, 2021","[Character, Jiwon Min, is slightly attracted to you.]

60,"Aug 11, 2021","good history lesson and good quotes from dokja, ""what matters is how I choose to live my life"" fighting!!"
60,"Aug 11, 2021",Him: as some of you may... // me: do not look at me...
60,"Aug 11, 2021","To be pedantic, ""Sainchamsageom"" means ""Four Tigers Evil Decapitator Sword"", not ""Four Yin Evil Decapitator Sword"". It was made on the hour of the Tiger, on the day of the Tiger, on the month of the Tiger, in the year of the Tiger, as contrast to other Zodiac animals."
60,"Aug 11, 2021",And because of Dokjas face people could think he is into men.xD
60,"Aug 11, 2021",Imagine all of Dokja's simps meet Dokja...the system wouldn't stop pinging him lol

60,"Jul 7, 2021",Dokja has priorities. Survival over love. 
60,"Aug 13, 2021",Dokja is such a simp for junghyeok oh my god like just kiss already PLEASE
60,"Sep 22, 2021","Dokja learned a valuable lesson: some women like it when you treat them rough. Hence the bad boy trope. Jiwon blushing hits different 😍 Can't wait to see the hilarious, awkward situations this will lead Dokja to. Nope I didn't know but thanks for the history lesson. That was very interesting. "
60,"Aug 29, 2021",i feel like dokja would be disgusted if he knew how much are simping on him and most are attracted with dominant people lmao
60,"Aug 20, 2021",HIS EXPRESSION EVERYTIME I CANTT-

60,"Aug 13, 2021","""slightly attracted to yo-"" dojka: =_=..."
60,"Aug 12, 2021","I feel like Dokja slowly watching all the likes on the episodes dwindle from 99,999 + to like 50,000"
60,"Aug 12, 2021","I highly suggest looking into the official art for Omniscient Reader by BLACKBOX, it's super pretty 😗😙. WARNInG: Avoid Beware of Spoilers it is art for the webnovel Σ(ಠ_ಠ)"

60,"Aug 12, 2021",I'm wondering where these guys found all these traditional clothes 🤔 
60,"Aug 11, 2021","omg so does that mean, dokja came the main lead of TWSA instead of junghyeok yu? shet shet shet na malagket "

60,"Aug 11, 2021",isn't Jiwon and Dokja like the exact same thing as Luffy and Hancock?
60,"Aug 11, 2021","think Dokja not having been rough with her physically is probably why she's only ""slightly"" attracted to him o-o (just my theory.) on a random note.. I flipping love her outfit even though it's kindda simple.. *o * "

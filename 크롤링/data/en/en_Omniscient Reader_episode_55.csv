55,"Jul 9, 2021","Aaah I never thought I’d end up with an obsession. Normal anime and manga never did it for me. But this has perfect plotline, a badass overpowered protagonist and amazing art."
55,"Jul 9, 2021",dokja being badass even when he's not wearing any pants
55,"Jul 7, 2021",Ok so normally I wouldn’t care but based off their reactions I have to know. Did they give him big pp or small pp

55,"Jul 7, 2021",finally fan service
55,"Jul 10, 2021",To think the great Abyssal Black Dragon was a bit intimidated by the other Black Dragon... 👀
55,"Jul 10, 2021","ah so they change ""King of No Killing"" to ""Immortal King""..but the title doesn't suit well with the attribute. Although yes, it does make sense partially because he can revive, but ONLY when he saves a total of people. Let's say: if he's in a situation where he's going to die and he didn't reached the given number, the attribute ""Immortal King"" will not work. Hope I explained it well? "
55,"Jul 7, 2021","Honestly I love how some people mimic constellations in the comments. It kinda makes me feel like it's part of the story, you know? Like if I haven't seen CrazyBrokeWeeb with their comment it just wouldn't have been a new chapter of Omniscient Reader 😂"
55,"Jul 7, 2021","[The constellation Abyssal Black Flame Dragon is looking at your black flame dragon] I LOVE THIS LMFAO. I was lowkey scared that the webtoon would censor the part where Dokja got naked but thankfully, they didn't. Hyeonseong's reaction to Dokja being naked was the best."
55,"Jul 7, 2021",ngl I thought ya'll would be simping harder and be more thirsty after this episode 
55,"Jul 7, 2021",Not the constellations dbeing disappointed with his little pickle
55,"Jul 6, 2021","It’s crazy how I started reading this series when it probably barely hit 20k, and I was shocked it didn’t have the 99,999+, and now it does and it’s amazing. It gets the love this story deserves with how much thought is put into it💞"

When Dokja made his contract with the dokkaebi early in the story, one if the clauses listed was that he couldn't sign with a supporting constellation until he either completed every scenario or died. Technically, Dokja just died and then came back to life. So if he signed with a supporting constellation, would he be violating his contract? That's a loophole."

55,"Nov 9, 2021","""The constellation, Ayssal Black Dragon, is staring at your balck dragon"" excuse me? 🤨"
55,"Nov 8, 2021",Ahh yes the black dragon... It is the serpentine type dragon of Japan's culture.
55,"Nov 7, 2021",But why is the Bald leader of the peasants army disappointed is he disappointed in Dokja's black dragon size? The fact that Huiwon handed him his former robe? Or did he wanted to see Dokja naked? Woh so many questions 
55,"Nov 7, 2021",So is he big or is he small? I am genuinely confused 
55,"Nov 6, 2021",I thought he was resurrected as the protagonist in the novel he's reading and bruh he looked like todoroki for a bit
55,"Nov 3, 2021",am I the only one who saw his pp? It's covered by shadow but the outline is still visible hahahaha.

55,"Aug 21, 2021","Yes! I knew he will pick cold resistance lol. I knew because although I like lie detection, cold resistance seems more cool. And I really don’t like heat, sun, but I do love spicy. I can handle cold but never heat. So I’m really glad he pick cold resistance"
55,"Aug 20, 2021","As a girl, i really wonder how it is to have a dragon"

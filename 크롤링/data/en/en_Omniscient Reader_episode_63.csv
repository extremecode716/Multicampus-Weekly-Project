63,"Jul 28, 2021",damn this conversation between Dokja and the fake author was really great and fun to read
63,"Jul 28, 2021",The minute of silence when they both figured out each other‚Äôs identities is goldEdit: is gold a word I can use in this context? My English is subpar so I wouldn‚Äôt know
63,"Jul 28, 2021","Anyone feels a little stressed that Gilyeong is so ready to kill people? Edit: yes yes i know that someone has to do it because if the people Dokja harmed were to bleed out their death would be on his hands but all I‚Äôm saying is, it‚Äôs a little disturbing that Gilyeong do it without any sense of guilt and remorse, i understand that the world they live in is ‚Äúto kill or to be killed‚Äù but even so, Gilyeong thought he would be better at killing people than Sangah, an adult edit2: yall i get it plsüò≠"

63,"Jul 28, 2021",I love how plagiarists are just left out of the profile system because the author considered them scum
63,"Jul 28, 2021",A Devil Who Should Not Be Messed With. The Maitreya King actually can read the future.
63,"Jul 28, 2021",You have lost your head privileges
63,"Jul 28, 2021",The cat and mouse between the author and Dokja is really cool
63,"Jul 28, 2021",Every bit of back and forth between the plagiarizing author and Dokja is just fantastic from the dialogue to the dramatic shading and THOSE SMIRKS. Aaaaaahhhhh these next couple of chapters are gonna be great
63,"Jul 28, 2021",I guess Dokja is really ‚ÄúAHEAD‚Äù of the game!
63,"Jul 28, 2021",Is Dokja the only king without a cool outfit? He's still wearing the robe he borrowed from Huiwon and still has no shirt or underwear.
63,"Jul 28, 2021","I love that look at other countries, so cool"
63,"Jul 28, 2021",Dokja seems to have a secret ability that protects him from everyone else‚Äôs bullshit‚Ä¶
63,"Jul 28, 2021","Papa Dokja gotta tech his son that killing shouldn't be that ""easy"" for him. Don't wanna see Gilyeong end up as a serial killer "
63,"Jul 28, 2021","Oh Dokja, you silver-tongued bastard, i love you so much!!"
63,"Jul 28, 2021","It'd be nice if webtoon provide the reader with the historical event in foot note or something like the novel did. the novel described it and even left a foot note to it. since most reader here are foreigners, it would help to better understand the story.ps: absolute throne still sound better and suit the story more for me tho (novel reader)"
63,"Jul 28, 2021",Webtoon readers: *exciting* Novel readers: *Bad laugh* here we go
63,"Jul 28, 2021",Dokja protecting tls123 from the plagiarizer is cute. Like I‚Äôd also cut their head off how rude of you üò§
63,"Jul 28, 2021",‚ÄúI‚Äôve never thought of that since my name is Dokja‚Äù JANSALSK SHUT UP. I‚Äôm ashamed I laughed at that so hard. üò≠

63,"Jul 28, 2021","Gilyeong is so fucking funny, kid just casually smashes heads in"
63,"Jul 29, 2021",For everyone worried about gilyeong just watch after him. Don‚Äôt worry just yet Dokja is keeping an eye on him. He grasps what it takes to survive in this world and help dokja. Sangah still hasn‚Äôt and she was never one who could kill so don‚Äôt be too alarmed. Huiwon would‚Äôve said the same as gilyeong.

63,"Jul 28, 2021",Man I sure wish I'm familiar with korean history to fully appreciate this :( The thought of people roleplaying the Arthurian legend in England? amusing stuff
63,"Jul 28, 2021",grrr dokja's the devil for a reason yknow
63,"Sep 1, 2021","When Han Suyeong and Dokja were laughing together, I thought about those rich ladies who hate each other but act like they are friends."
63,"Jul 28, 2021",dokja really making use of his quick draw skills lately
63,"Jul 28, 2021",Is it the guy with clones from earlier?
63,"Jul 28, 2021",How the heck did no one bring up that about his name till now?  That‚Äôs a cliche
63,"Jul 28, 2021",Soooo we not gonna talk about how dokja is on a killing spree. And has no hesitation at all?!!!
63,"Sep 1, 2021","Omg I just realized something genius. Even if the future changes due to Dokja or the other readers‚Äô involvement, he‚Äôll still know pretty much how everything will go because the book went through like hundreds of regressions. Dokja is familiar with hundreds of iterations and possibilities for this story"
63,"Jul 28, 2021","This chapter was so good! I just wanted to say that I recently finished the ORV Webnovel and it's sooo good and reading this episode filled me with nostalgia. It'll take a long time for the Webtoons to reach the Novel's conclusion but it's such a great adaptation and story with so many great characters,pain, and an intricate plot. I just wanna say that y'all should stick with this Webtoon even in it's lenght cuz it's pure unfiltered fiction. Have fun with the new characters and angst:]]"
63,"Aug 30, 2021","Am I the only web novel reader who likes the name ""Absolute Throne"" better than ""Ruler's Throne?"""
63,"Sep 1, 2021",The kid was playing wack a mole
63,"Sep 1, 2021",I loved the whole dialogue's passive agressive energy
63,"Sep 1, 2021",Sangah is such a strong person for killing those guys to protect Gilyeong even though she didn't want to do it...
63,"Sep 1, 2021","""A Devil who should not be messed with"" I really like that description of Dokja"
63,"Sep 1, 2021","I'm a little upset at the translation here lacking notes about the Korean language and history that is intertwined especially here where their constellations are historical and their stories play a role here. For example, the Earthworm vs earth dragon use. Unfortunately I've found this to be a more informed read in the scanlations, I really appreciate contextual clues and dual meanings like that üòî "
63,"Jul 28, 2021","""I gotta make sure I don't murder anyone or I'll lose the immortal king attribute""
begins next episode by cutting up 10 dudes without hesitation.

I get that the other two did the finishing blows but come on Dokja, you're cutting things a bit close chopping off dudes arms and such"
63,"Sep 1, 2021","Something interesting is that the ""coward"" king is called the ""wise king"" in the original novel and other translated versions, could hiding be the best strat here?"
63,"Sep 1, 2021","I remember like 30 chapters ago, people were all talking about how precious and adorable Gilyeong was and I was just scared for the kid because i already saw that he was knee deep in Hero-Worshiping Mode and on a trajectory for exactly this. He is 1000% prepared to do anything for Dokja and would probably rip off his own arm if he asked. This is so unhealthy and I deeply fear for this kid's future..."

63,"Sep 1, 2021","And meanwhile in America, the world‚Äôs largest production of Hamilton"
63,"Jul 29, 2021",ngl kinda curious whats going on in places like North and South America or Australia with the lack of monarchies in thier history outside of ones like the Inca and Aztecs
63,"Aug 25, 2021",I like how all the other kings are decked out but dokja is just chilling in stuff he pilfered from his subordinates after losing his clothes
63,"Sep 1, 2021",‚ÄúA devil that should not be messed with‚Äù do you know how proud i was to read that üòÇ
63,"Sep 1, 2021",Everyone‚Äôs thinking that how tf can gilyeoung kill others at such a young age..well actually according to me ppl find it hard to kill because of their morality which is developed over the years so a kid like Gilyeoung who is literally like 8 years old doesn‚Äôt have much of that‚Ä¶and his morality is learning and developing very quickly at this age so it has quickly adapted to the newer and the more fucked up morality of the new world‚Ä¶...
63,"Sep 1, 2021","there's a top comment mentioning gilyeong's readiness to kill being unsettling and ppl arguing he has to, qnd i just want to point out that gilyeong's behavior is exactly what's got sangah so unsettled and worried lol"

63,"Sep 1, 2021","dokja and fakeymcfakerson's convo are so fucking funny in their intensity, also gilyeong murdering on a whim is a mood"
63,"Sep 1, 2021",Dokja'a way of baiting people and gauging their reactions before straight up destroying them?? Exquisite.
63,"Aug 31, 2021","I'm hoping we'll get to see a bit more of the other characters development, I know the story is more based on Dokja's experience but it would be awesome to see Gilyeoung and the others possibly have a moral dilemma at times and whether following Dokja is the right thing to do. We havent seen much of them on their own so hopefully we'll get to see them evolve from a follower role to being more independent and not just side characters."

63,"Jul 28, 2021","Oh wow, they really showed Gilyoung going for that kill. Sangah's arm was trembling ü•∫ I loved the back and forth between Dokja & the plagiarizer (I don't like how they romanized his name despite it still being technically correct tho)"
63,"Sep 6, 2021","Please to all readers. Like the chapters because it is falling behind already. We all know that some are not here already since webtoon is late and not that on point and they are reading them to ""others s√Æ≈£…ô"" but please do support the ORV by liking the series and chapters in the official webtoon so the series will produce more good drawing."
63,"Sep 5, 2021","the dialogue exchange between dokja and the ""author"" is so interesting and fun to read!  hope he becomes a recurring antagonist in the series <3 "
63,"Sep 2, 2021",Why is it so easy to forget that other countries exist in stories that take place in one singular one?

63,"Sep 2, 2021","I'm worried for Gilyeong. LIKE BOY JUST KILLED A GUY WITHOUT ANY HESITATION AND SAID HE'D BE BETTER AT IT- I KNOW, IT'S SORT OF BADASS BUT LIKE, HE'S A KID AFTER ALL. HE HAS NOTHING LEFT IN HIM A CHILD SHOULD HAVE, LIKE GUILT OF KILLING A FUCKING MAN. its just sorry to see a kid acting like this. Sangah being terrified at the way he's acting is very understandable. And it's also weird how fast he came to accept all this tho. Like this apocalypse. I know it's good for survival but still... "
63,"Sep 1, 2021",that vicious conversation between dokja and the fake author was oddly thrilling ! :)
63,"Sep 1, 2021","Even I smirked a lot here aah.. anyway gilyeong isn't a normal boy,dokja isn't a normal devil and author isn't the normal author..bt where the heck is the author's real body hiding"

63,"Sep 1, 2021",Did he just lose his buff of not killing anyone- but then again it seemed like the fake author was still alive even after his head was removed‚Ä¶ so maybe he won‚Äôt have the buff removed since technically he didn‚Äôt kill anyone‚Ä¶?

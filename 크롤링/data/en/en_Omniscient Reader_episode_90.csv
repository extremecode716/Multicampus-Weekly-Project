Episode,Date,Review
90,"Feb 2, 2022","Lee Gilyoung: Woah, a new insect to my collection. üòà"
90,"Feb 2, 2022",I can finally breathe. Gilyeong is alive. Our terrifying cinnamon roll is alive.
90,"Feb 2, 2022","Dokja: ""I must not look up!!!"" Also Dokja: *looks up*"
90,"Feb 2, 2022",gilyoung‚Äôs face‚Ä¶suddenly i don‚Äôt want to sleep anymore
90,"Feb 2, 2022",oh God the scary one is still alive. I mean yay gilyoung lives
90,"Feb 2, 2022",Poor Lil Gilyeong looks like he's gone insane...
90,"Feb 2, 2022","BTW, strongly strongly strongly recommend any of you all to read ahead in the light novel. It's literally going to take years for this all to be made on Webtoons and the story is so much more than you can even imagine at this point. It's definitely worth it üëç"
90,"Feb 2, 2022","Insect Queen enters tall grass-- ""A wild Bug Catcher appears!"""
90,"Feb 2, 2022","Gilyoung, that's a scary expression on your face..."
90,"Feb 2, 2022",Lee Gilyeong after seeing the wolf bug: Oh look! A new Pok√©mon to catch! (lol)
90,"Feb 2, 2022",Wait did the dog die or just unconscious and the insect queen took over the weakened body? I really liked him I hope he survives.
90,"Feb 2, 2022","This chapter reminded me of a stark contrast of how everything started versus how things are now. None of them would have dared face off against monster like that in the beginning besides Dokja, and even that was a risk for him. Now they're so powerful, they're laying waste to high level monsters by the handful. wonderful progression, really. "
90,"Feb 2, 2022",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' finally felt that time is finally flowing and witnessed them resting.][5 coins have been sponsored. ]
90,"Feb 2, 2022",Dokja be really cool. That white coat looks so damn good on him. 
90,"Feb 2, 2022",I really love how this series has given actual adventures to every character even without Dokja. I love seeing the implications of story without being directly told everything  immediately. I'm also really worried for our little boy Gilyoung.
90,"Feb 6, 2022","all the comments about Gilyoung but none about Sangah. we see how little we knew about her, or it could be we see how much this can change a person. all we saw of her was her niceness, but it was partly just a way to excel in the old world along with her credentials etc. now, the way to excel is to be powerful. but she's still a good person at heart and I hope she stays that way!"
90,"Feb 2, 2022","How to get across a river, Dokja style: 1. Approach the river 2. Bait a giant water serpant 3. Get eaten 4. Wait a few minutes 5. Kill the beast from inside and get out on the other side"
90,"Feb 2, 2022",Didn't strike Sangah the fighting type but I suppose we all have to learn to survive sometimes. Let's hope those gods dont kill that innocent girl cause if they do Dokja is gonna raise hell
90,"Feb 2, 2022","Did anyone else think the words ""oh F*CK"" when they saw the look in Gilyeong's eyes? Because I had horror movie vibes looking at him"
90,"Feb 2, 2022","THE WAY DOKJA LOOKS AT YOO SANGAH , I CAN'T-"
90,"Feb 26, 2022",glad that gilyeong and the internet boy whom i almost forget about are alive ü•≤
90,"Feb 2, 2022",I think it's really meaningful being reminded that even in a situation like that people can choose to give up or get up and try to live even without knowing what will happen next.I'm curious to see how everyone's character development goes and to what extent they are affected by the apocalypse. 
90,"Mar 3, 2022",I like how sangah is at the moment bc she seems more confident in herself 
90,"Feb 2, 2022",Gilyoung: I like shorts! They're comfy and easy to wear!
90,"Feb 2, 2022","I'm usually scared of children, but Gilyoung... he terrifies me!"
90,"Feb 2, 2022","I really missed Gilyeong, I'm glad he's back!"
90,"Feb 2, 2022",Dokja: this is my orgin story
90,"Feb 2, 2022",Gilyoung is a menace üíÄ I like itüòà
90,"Feb 2, 2022",So I‚Äôm suspecting that The insect queen either takes over Gilyeong‚Äôs body OR he makes some kind of connection with her. Praying for the latter üôè 
90,"Mar 9, 2022","this chapter is so.. sad :( the acceptance sangah had decided of this new world pains the most for me she was a lovely woman in her life before T___T she always tries her best to help back then and now... even when that meant to kill people:(
even then i love her character here that adapted with firm and new principal! she's a bit scary but will be the most kindhearted person u can ever meet in this ruined world i think"
90,"Mar 2, 2022",Sangah is so pretty ü•∫
90,"Mar 9, 2022","thats not a river, thats death"
90,"Mar 9, 2022","Plagiarist lady is growing on me tbh, she's becoming much more reliable now"
90,"Mar 9, 2022",looks like gilyoung is in a different genre üò≠
90,"Mar 9, 2022",The terrifying group is about to get quite a bit more terrifying when they all finally group together again haha
90,"Feb 2, 2022","I know it's a wild guess, but what if the plagia girl is actually the real author of TWSA and she's just toying with KDJ? I can't think of anyone else who could have written the book."
90,"Mar 10, 2022","Dang, and they portrayed Sangah so beautifully as well, this chapter!! üòç Thank you, Artist-nim!!"
90,"Mar 9, 2022",I‚Äôd just like to think that YJH is all the way in the other side of the broken city and is just cursing at Kim Dokja ‚Äúdamn you kim dokja what did you do‚Äù
90,"Mar 9, 2022","Omg Gilyong is getting more psychotic, I swear. He‚Äôs still adorable but he‚Äôs definitely becoming a force to be reckoned with. It‚Äôs concerning. I hope he doesn‚Äôt turn into an unstable, bad guy. And Sangahs little tail belt thing is so cute! Makes her look like a cat. I like that Dokja is slowly becoming like Junghyeok"
90,"Mar 9, 2022",So Dokja is trying to become a constellation.
90,"Feb 9, 2022","Okay, realizing that Dokja hasn‚Äôt just been doing things based on the novel & actually had a goal in mind is probably the coolest thing ever . "
90,"Mar 9, 2022","""I've never seen an insect like you before"" damn, how long since we last saw him? "
90,"Mar 9, 2022","*sees gilyoung*me: hey, gilyoung. thank God!
*sees his psychotic expression*
me: ..gilyoung...?
"
90,"Mar 10, 2022",I both found the panel of Gilyeong hilarious and am terrified for his sanity‚Äî and noooo not Lycaon I didn‚Äôt want him to die
90,"Mar 9, 2022",uhhh Gilyoung be scaring me more and more each time I see him in still reeling from the fact he openly volunteered to kill people for dokja all those chapters back. Now he's got some crazy eyes I hope he isn't losing his sanity or humanity more and more each time he connects with bugs. Kinda like in jungle juice where bug humans can lose themselves to instinct.
90,"Mar 11, 2022",Bro on god that Gilyoung panel is straight FIRE
90,"Mar 10, 2022","I‚Äôm sad about Sangah‚Äôs hardened personality, but it‚Äôs true. She needs to be strong to survive this new world. She is not a character with plot armor. (Ironically, she is to us but.. you know what I mean!)"
90,"Mar 10, 2022",it's the fucking insect type Pokemon trainer!
90,"Mar 10, 2022","*sees evil bug* ""a fine addition to my collection."""
90,"Mar 9, 2022",Yes Gilyoung is getting up. And Dokja is finally starting to grow his second of many fables being born. 
90,"Mar 12, 2022",Can Dokja and his boyfriend just adopt Gilyoung already??
90,"Mar 10, 2022",The artist did such a good job portraying the moment Gilyeong met Ant lady ü§© 
90,"Mar 9, 2022",I wish the wolf had lasted longer instead of the stupid bug
90,"Mar 9, 2022",OUR CHILD IS ALIVE NOW WE JUST NEED HUIWON AND THE MOUNTAIN GUY
90,"Mar 23, 2022",The Parasite Queen now knows how a Legendary Pok√©mon feels when it sees a 10 year old in the woods.
90,"Mar 22, 2022","lol, dokja is gilyeong‚Äôs tired dad-figure "
90,"Mar 16, 2022",Sangah is like the dark hero we didn't want. We just want her to be happy... with Dokja. But now we are seeing her strong but feel alone
90,"Mar 10, 2022",hello this amazing and I love the use of ancient mythology and war heros. could u use maori god please
90,"Mar 9, 2022",I love this webtoon
90,"Mar 9, 2022",gilyoung looked a little scary hahha
90,"Mar 10, 2022","Insect Queen: *exists* Gilyeong: ""A fine addition to my collection"""
90,"Mar 10, 2022",antinus is gilyeoung's prey
90,"Mar 10, 2022",Insect lady thought she had it easy when she met a kid‚Ä¶.. but that kid happened to be gilyoung.
90,"Mar 10, 2022","Anyone else kinda wish we got to actually *see* the events that took place with the other characters? I kept expecting it to switch back and forth between them and Dokja. I admit, the element of mystery is intriguing, but I just started to miss them and seeing how much Sangah changed in such a short time makes me really want to see what got her there, like, I feel like I missed out on awesome content (that becomes less cool if told as flashback with less tension as we know the outcome)"
90,"Mar 10, 2022",Aww I liked better the outer gods because it sounded so lovecraftian 
90,"Mar 9, 2022",Ofc use dragons as stepping stones.
90,"Mar 9, 2022","Guys, I am not trying to spoil the story because I haven‚Äôt finished it myself. But I think that the secretive plotter may be the author of the book?üòïüòü"
90,"Mar 9, 2022",i thought something possessed gilyoung .. but then i remembered its the normal  insect loving gilyoung we all love 
90,"Mar 9, 2022",I'm still so sad about what Sangha has been through are her change in mindset üòî I hope she'll feel better later on
90,"Mar 9, 2022",Sangah ‚ô•Ô∏é
90,"Mar 9, 2022","wow , so nostalgic seeing those seacreatures again , last time i saw one was in the begining"
90,"Feb 2, 2022","""i think its time we crossed the river"" ""that river? how?"" ""jump"""
90,"Feb 2, 2022",Oh yeah we all know he is adding that insect queen to his collection!
90,"Feb 13, 2022","KDJ: I must not look up right now. If I do... 4th wall: Don't worry, bestie. Look up now, I got you. KDJ: thanks bestie *looks up*. // this is what basically happened."
90,"Mar 23, 2022",I wonder what his stigma will be?
90,"Mar 12, 2022",sangah my baby </3
90,"Mar 10, 2022",Why did everybody in the comments change the spelling of Gilyeong‚Äôs name to Gilyoung?? My name is Emily but if people started just writing it Emilie I‚Äôd be kind of weirded out‚Ä¶
90,"Mar 10, 2022",Gilyeong : A fine addition to my collection („ÜÅœâ„ÜÅ)
90,"Mar 10, 2022",I wonder who the author is 
90,"Mar 10, 2022",y‚Äôall that bug queen is about to mess with the wrong fetus
90,"Mar 10, 2022",That‚Äôs gotta be a pretty deep river
90,"Mar 9, 2022",Gilyoung: A fine addition to my collection!
90,"Mar 9, 2022",I low key forgot the Internet guy existed lol
90,"Mar 9, 2022","Why is no one talking about the amazing and strong Sangah‚Ä¶ All I see is Gilyoung‚Ä¶ I believe something must‚Äôve caused Sangah to snap, so it was probably the nightmare thing that caused all of them to separate. Last time, when they were trapped in a cell w some nightmare curse, Sangah was protected and we weren‚Äôt able to see what her nightmare was so maybe that was why she didn‚Äôt snap then and only now "
90,"Mar 9, 2022",Sir you should take your own advice
90,"Mar 9, 2022",F. Wolfboy :(
90,"Mar 9, 2022",Little dude's gone mad.
90,"Mar 9, 2022",Gilyoung looking like the bug catcher boy on route 1
90,"Mar 9, 2022","Ah, Gilyoung! Yeah, you‚Äôre screwed now, parasite queen üòÇ "
90,"Mar 9, 2022",That little kid in the woods scared me.  
90,"Mar 17, 2022","To those who care: I read the light novel, and I finished it last week. Guys, I‚Äôm telling you, it gets so much better yet so much worse üò≠ you‚Äôll know what I mean when you go far enough"
90,"Mar 14, 2022","I have now caught up, and unfortunately, I am too broke to even fast pass. So the waiting begins. This sucks."
90,"Mar 13, 2022","Oh lawd I actually managed to binge this ahaha, time to join y‚Äôall in the weekly suffering "
90,"Mar 12, 2022","""I sometimes feel that the story is different despite reading the same thing"" - HSY"
90,"Mar 12, 2022","high key kinda forgot that Hyeonseong, Huiwon, and Gilyeong existed"
90,"Mar 10, 2022",yo it's the river from the first or second scenario

90,"Mar 9, 2022",I can't believe you're still here Cheesy as Pie omg
90,"Mar 9, 2022","i searched for a comment who talks about the art, but found nothing. so here i wanna say that THE ART IS DAMN DOPE!üî• I realized that the author(s) are making improvements in drawing scene with brilliant PERSPECTIVES! we all artists know how hard drawing in a perfect perspective is TvTüôåüèª"

90,"Mar 9, 2022",My dumbass got the spoiler for who secretive plotter is by reading orv incorrect quotes. send brain cells.
90,"Mar 9, 2022","Just swim, right Dokja?üòÇ"
90,"Mar 9, 2022",You are special. You are loved.
90,"Mar 9, 2022","you see theres a thing called electrocution that travels throught water, use a big enough voltage, everything in that river. Good as dead, it's basic pokemon typing advantage's as well as science"

90,"Mar 10, 2022","I'm happy that Gilyoung is back and all, but they whole chapter I was wondering what the hell means that Dokja is turning into a fable, and having stigmas?!!! I definitely didn't expected that... "
90,"Mar 10, 2022","when did the wolf get hurt?wasn't he meditating last time we saw him?
"

90,"Mar 9, 2022","I forgot about Gilyoung for a second and went""Wow look at the this pokemon trainer finding a new member for the team"""
90,"Mar 9, 2022",‡∏Ö ïÔΩ°ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•ÔΩ° î‡∏Ö Are you there?
90,"Mar 9, 2022","The really interesting thing here is that Dokja is awakening a stigma. So far as we knew up to this point, you had to receive those from a supporting constellation. So what does it mean that he's gaining one on his own?"
90,"Mar 9, 2022",I can't wait for the reunion!
90,"Mar 9, 2022","Gilyoung is back, I have missed the little insect patriarch of thors hammer"
90,"Mar 9, 2022",The artwork for Gilyoung is amazing and I love the fact he looks like a deranged Pok√©mon trainer. Dude took being a bug type trainer really seriously 
90,"Mar 9, 2022",I'm kind of sad that the wolf died so early and pretty much off screen... glad Gilyeoung is ok... but he's giving of evil vibes... and where is that demon cursed guy at?
90,"Mar 9, 2022",Gilyoung is still a cinnamon roll in my eyes‚ô°_‚ô°
90,"Mar 9, 2022",Y'ALL I FORGOT ABOUT DONGHOON AND GILYOUNG THIS WHOLE TIME
90,"Mar 9, 2022","Finally, news about Best Girl Huiwon"
90,"Mar 9, 2022","My boy, Gilyoung! ü•∫üòö I missed you so much! I snorted at the part Dokja says, ""Hope he's okay"" more like, I think is the other way around üòÇ Will she be okay? My precious-not-so-cinnamon-roll kid! üòÜ Then I saw the thumbnail for the next episode and I internally screamed in excitement! üî•ü§©"
90,"Mar 9, 2022",Wait so Dokja was seeing that scene with Gilyeong and the insect girl in the wolf‚Äôs body but he also saw where hyeonseong and huiwon are?
90,"Mar 9, 2022",sangah üòç 
90,"Mar 9, 2022",When everyone else was drawn with long eyelashes despite specifically being described to have fairly long eyelashes. Kim Dokja: ( T_T)Ôºº(^-^ ) GIVE HIM HIS EYELASHES!!
90,"Mar 9, 2022",Gilyoung is alive! I was wondering where his wholesome ass was
90,"Mar 9, 2022",ysa is such a milf urghhh
90,"Mar 9, 2022",I thought he said Ariana like Ariana GrandeüíÄü§ö
90,"Feb 2, 2022",The glint in Gilyeong's eye when he found another insect to control ü§£
90,"Aug 25, 2022","is that Gilyeong's ""excited to encounter a new insect type"" face or has he been away from Dokja for too long?"
90,"Jun 11, 2022",I knew it! All I thought about when Insect queen appeared was how much Gilyeong would love her lmaoo
90,"Jun 10, 2022",GILYEONG HE'S ALIVE HE'S ALIVE IM ABOUT TO CRY üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
90,"Jun 9, 2022","Omg I‚Äôm so happy we got to see Gilyeong, I‚Äôve missed him so much üò≠"
90,"May 13, 2022","Is Gilyoung connected to the ""Lord of the Flies,"" Beelzebub, or the ""King of Locusts,"" Abaddon (since locusts are a form of grasshopper, and he was introduced with grasshoppers... And is surprisingly menacing here), or something? Honestly haven't read the book, but I'm VERY curious. If someone wants to spoil that part, by all means... I was trying to think of a deity or historical figure connected to insects from Norse mythology, since Gilyoung wields a replica Mjolnir, but none come to mind..."
90,"Apr 30, 2022","I'll admit it. I didn't question it if the little guy was dead or alive. I was thinking, only if Lee Gilyoung was here then maybe he could control her."
90,"Apr 13, 2022",this kid went from boy scout to menace real quick.
90,"Apr 3, 2022","i asked "" where did the kid who talks to insects go"" on the previous chapter and here he is"

- I have a theory that Dokja and Junyeok are somehow the same entity in some way. it's been bothering me for a long time. 

also curious : Junyeok with the first woman he loved. could this end up being Dokja and Sang too. And Junyeok's son, perhaps Gilyeong as he treats Dokja as a father figure and Sang treats Gil like a mother figure?

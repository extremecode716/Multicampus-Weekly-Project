Episode,Date,Review
58,"Jun 23, 2021","Gotta say, really liking the banter/relationship between Huiwon and Dokja Edit: Thank you all for commenting and advancing on my little ship, but be warned that there are some spoilers in the comments. @Namiiee0613 thank you for the suggestion."
58,"Jun 23, 2021","Yay! Ughhhh my spending addiction is Back! That 2 weeks killed me tho, But I’m sooo glad we’re back in the grove again!!😵‍💫….  Do y’all Ship Huikja??💙🤔"
58,"Jun 23, 2021","""I guess you might end up a slave, Dokja."" Don't call him ugly, Huiwon! 😭"
58,"Jun 23, 2021","Lmao the disrespect! I love Heewon & how she turned Dokja's remark around to imply she's beautiful (which is very true!). Dokja the scamming king is gonna be really rich w/ all those sales. Also, it has been so long since we saw the sky. I didn't realize how long we stay underground in the beginning of the story. Speaking of the subway, they really brought in that chair down there for the Tyrant King 😅 It looks so out of place lol"
58,"Jun 23, 2021","""Both the character and I have to be thinking about each other"" Me: That means Yu was thinking about you... *analyzes* but he was doing so killing people "". _ ."
58,"Jun 23, 2021",I love the friendship that is forming between Huiwon and Dokja. And I can’t wait to see why he won’t let her fight
58,"Jun 23, 2021",'People' vs 'Characters' is definitely going to be an 'interesting' discussion later... I kinda preemptively feel bad for puppy Heonseong?  He's too precious for this TT^TT
58,"Jun 23, 2021","So if Dokja isn’t a main character, he sure seems to be on the road to making himself one. "
58,"Jun 23, 2021",Huiwon is so pretty!!
58,"Jun 23, 2021","Everyone in the comic looks so pretty that when they roast Dokja for looking “bad”, I’m like, that’s bad looking?!! Well sh*t, I must be a flaming hunk of garbage then"
58,"Jun 25, 2021","I love the relationship between Huiwon and Dokja. Hopefully they just stay friends. I kind of ship them, because they're funny together, but that doesn't mean I want them being romantically involved. Somehow I get the feeling that they won't see each other in that way. ☺️"
58,"Jun 23, 2021",Dokja playin 4D chess and all the Kings are his pawns 
58,"Jun 24, 2021",Haha dude still has no pants!! 
58,"Jun 23, 2021",...So we're not going to talk about how dokja and huiwon shared one brain cells? or am I too late in realizing? 🤔
58,"Jun 23, 2021","Ha so does this mean that Yu was thinking about Dokja? oh my!😘😈 *(tis a joke, please do not overanalyze)"
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Huiwon and Dokja are the ultimate insulting duo.
58,"Jun 24, 2021","so, the Omniscient Reader ability is ...being psychic?! >Level 1: Empathy / Sensing.           >Level 2: Telepathy. >Level 3: Astral Projection"
58,"Jun 23, 2021","Forget tyrant king, let me be in your harem Kim Dokja! I'm willing to do anything! You can step on me and I'll die happy! "
58,"Jun 23, 2021","If Huiwon and Dokja are ugly, then I must be E.T. 🤔"
58,"Jul 28, 2021","""i guess you might end up as a slave, dokja."" HUIWON JUST THROWING ROASTS OUT THERE"
58,"Jul 28, 2021","Don’t worry Dokja, we think you’re beautiful."
58,"Jun 25, 2021",Wait so that means Yu and Dokja were thinking about eachother........... how cute
58,"Jun 23, 2021",I can’t be the only person that ships Huiwon and Dokja like if you agree
58,"Jun 23, 2021",it's been 84 years..... 
58,"Jun 23, 2021",I always wait a bit to read this so I know that [LAZY BROKE WEEB] has had time to comment. Otherwise the experience just isn’t as good.
58,"Jun 29, 2021",I see all those ppl shipping huiwon and dokja but all my homies will know that the best ship is rat bastard X sunfish bastard. 
58,"Jun 23, 2021",I only meant to see how he killed the dragon but now I'm here... 
58,"Jun 23, 2021",[The constellation That Writer is pleased with the return of Omniscient Reader] [5 coins have been sponsored]
58,"Jul 28, 2021","😭🤚 my man dokja cant catch a break, ppl be roasting his looks left n right-"
58,"Jul 23, 2021","spreading fake news AND pricing them for 1,000 coins each? He be scamming them hard 😭"
58,"Jul 29, 2021",Y’all Dokja is not ugly?!? The dude is of decent height and has intellect. His nose isn’t too low or too high. His Eyes aren’t to big or small and his face is pretty proportional. His personality takes some time to get used to but after you are when he blows things up he’s hot asf. So ugly where?!
58,"Jul 28, 2021","""do you have the con-man attribute?!"" omg i love bihyung so much"
58,"Jun 23, 2021","that 2 week hiatus was a nightmare. hopefully OP is okay, and everything will go back to normal"
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Why does Huiwon keep getting hotter and hotter?
58,"Jun 25, 2021",Tyrant King is a chaotic bi
58,"Jul 28, 2021",so.... Jungkyeok was thinking of Dokja and that's why dokja could use the 1st person pov? hmMMMM
58,"Jun 23, 2021",Kim Dokja doesn't need a con man attribute to scam 😎
58,"Jul 29, 2021","I love seeing Dokja's and Heewon's relationship progress and strenghtening without any forced romance between them. It's so refreshing and they are such power companions! It's really great to see, I'm tired of forced romance between leads of opposite sex just to add some romance in a plot which doesn't need it and would most likely be actually worse and not better if added. My aro heart really loves that (1/2)"
58,"Jul 28, 2021",At this point the [Lazy Broke Weeb] is part of the lore
58,"Jul 28, 2021",I am still not over people calling Dokja ugly when he looks like a god.
58,"Jul 28, 2021",does anyone else feel like huiwon is one of the best girls in the series?
58,"Jul 29, 2021","istg, huiwon and dokja are just like siblings 💀"
58,"Jun 23, 2021",smart move honestly. I don't think huiwon's attribute will be useful here... Also can we gat my main man dokja some clothes please?
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Lmao dude still going around in his underwear. 😂
58,"Jul 28, 2021","less and less people are liking this webtoon😔 and for the people still reading, please support the creator by liking and commenting"
58,"Jul 28, 2021",why is everyone calling Dokja ugly? he's a handsome young man!
58,"Jun 23, 2021","I hate catching up to great webtoons and then having to wait a week for weekly uploads, the struggle is real, story way too good 😭😭"
58,"Jul 29, 2021",They really be calling each other ugly😂
58,"Jul 29, 2021","What's funny about the omniscient readers viewpoint skill in terms of observing the other characters (like how Dokja explained) is that it works like POV when related to characters' experiences. Level one is 3rd person omniscient, level 2 is 3rd person limited, and level 3 is 1st person. That's really cool, nicely done, author!!"
58,"Jul 28, 2021","Me: “Wow, they’re like siblings! Reminds me of banter between my older brother and sister, haha!” People in the comments: “SHIP!” Me: “OH-“"
58,"Jul 5, 2021",Dokja is getting bullied by her...... straight up called him ugly 😂😭😭😂
58,"Jul 30, 2021","I think a have a theory (idk if someone had already said it). What if “future” Dojka is the real author of TWSA, and he wrote it for his past-self so he’ll know how to survive. "
58,"Jul 29, 2021",Dude still hasn’t found a pair of replacement pants in like three episodes 🤣
58,"Jul 28, 2021",I luv how the world is ending and they're just there arguing about who looks more pretty.Totally not me tho...
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Three chapters and that guy is still pants-less
58,"Jul 28, 2021","""they have to be thinking about each other"" so... dokja and junghyuk...? 🤨"
58,"Jul 29, 2021",im pretty sure huiwon just got hotter
58,"Jul 28, 2021","If this WEBTOON doesn’t get animated or doesn’t get a colaboration with crunchy roll or something I’m gonna be sad bc this is one of the best story and plot lines I’ve ever read, and I’ve seen those weak a*s anime’s where the protagonist is op from the get go but here the main character may have the players manual with all the hidden secrets but he still has to work around the bs and curveballs sent his way but he always has me guessing every time an episode ends"
58,"Jun 28, 2021",Huiwon saying Dokja is ugly without shame 😅
58,"Jun 23, 2021","I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Kim Dokja, you are a master at being a total troll, and I am loving it!"
58,"Jul 28, 2021","""I guess you might end up a slave"" 😭😭"
58,"Jun 24, 2021","There’s a mistake in the translation where it says, “There are even incarnations who gifted their constellation the file.” This is the opposite of what it says in the book. Please correct this, and keep up the hard work."
58,"Oct 17, 2021",huiwon and dokja have such a fun dynamic. I kinda hope it stays platonic. also why do y'all spoil so much in people's replies!! makes me scared to comment anything. Jeez. 
58,"Aug 8, 2021","Dokja and Huiwon have a lot of interactions recently and their relationships seem to grow. Idk whether it become romantic love or not, but it's definetly a good ship! Also I like Sangah, but I honestly don't see any hints in the plot that she might end up with Dokja. Since the first chapter there is no chemistry at all between them. Besides, Sangah sticks around HeonSeong quite often. "
58,"Jul 30, 2021",Aww🤗...that means Dokja and Junghyeok were thinking of each other when he first activated lvl 3 reader's viewpoint!
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Me thinking “hmm Dokja’s pretty enough to become a concubine-“Huiwon immediately “you could become a slave dokja” 💀💀😂😂  love her 
58,"Jul 28, 2021","Huiwon remains my favorite person. That casual personality and strong sense of justice as well as unfailing loyalty is a killer character trait combo. Also, I love her low key shade throwing 😂 "
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Dokja and Huwon acting like siblings is cute 
58,"Jul 28, 2021","them: ""Well the others are characters, we are real people""me: dude, how do I say this..."
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Dokja trying to figure out who is real and who is a character made me question my existence ngl
58,"Jul 30, 2021","Huiwon was always good looking, but that last panel made her look beautiful"
58,"Jul 28, 2021",dokja and huiwon sibling goals lol 
58,"Jul 28, 2021","Tyrant king really just said, ""A hole is a hole"""
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Huiwon saying Dokja would prolly be a slave and indirectly saying he's ugly is just... 😂
58,"Jul 28, 2021",When does Dokja actually sleep and eat?
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Yes. I think it's better if Huiwon didn't go too since she might encounter the Tyrant King and might become a concubine. 
58,"Jul 28, 2021",I'm kind of hoping there will be a little bit of romance in this serie? Those two are clearly a great team!
58,"Jul 28, 2021",“A good nap is more important than you think”  true sleep is needed. And also lol “Mommy” love Dojka and Huiwon insulting each other 😭
58,"Jul 29, 2021",why was junghyeok thinking of dokja before LMFAO 
58,"Jul 28, 2021",I swear not one of yall should forget to like the ep. YOU NEED TO SUPPORT THE  AUTHOR
58,"Aug 9, 2021",I just realized that man still doesn’t wear pants after Dokja asked for his 😂
58,"Jul 29, 2021","I started this webtoon 2 days ago and was like ""there's do many episodes yay, let's get reading"" Less than 48 hours later, here I am, waiting for the next episode to release 🥲."
58,"Jul 28, 2021","""I guess you might end up a slave, Dokja"" lmao Huiwon is ruthless 💀"
58,"Jul 28, 2021","Come on, Dokja is fine! Stop calling him ugly"
58,"Jul 28, 2021",It's so funny that Huiwon and Dokja ship has fans coz like that was the least teased ship in the webnovel. I'm liking the chemistry between them in the webtoon ^^
58,"Jul 28, 2021",i keep forgetting he gave Dokja his pants
58,"Jul 28, 2021",huiwon really came for dokja’s neck 💀
58,"Jul 3, 2021",Why this story so addictive... it's first time I use my coins for many unlock chapter to I read.. I kept repeatedly reading this story from chapter 0 until current chapter.. (^^)
58,"Jul 29, 2021","""the character and i have to be thinking about each other"" so while you were fighting the dragon whatsoever and almost end up dead you're telling me yjh was thinking about you and vice versa? okay... sounds pretty straight."
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Anyone notice that one of the tyrant king’s slaves looks really similar to dokja 😭😭 idk why people keep calling our deadly cinnamon roll ugly when he’s so beautiful 
58,"Aug 12, 2021",They both have to be thinking about each other???🌚🌚🌚🌚 Does that mean Junghyuk and Dokja think about each other often?🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚
58,"Aug 7, 2021",i really love huiwon and dokja’s chemistry
58,"Jul 30, 2021",dokja and huiwon are like siblings LMAO i love their relationship sm
58,"Jul 29, 2021",so it is now canon that Junghyeok thinks about Dokja 😳 
58,"Jul 28, 2021","Maybe I'm just dumb, but how did Dokja know that he and the other person had to be thinking of each other in order for him to activate the first person viewpoint"
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Dokja : What's wrong with her? Huiwon : What is wrong with him?
58,"Jul 28, 2021",I'm fan of this series and also fan of Lazy Broke Weeb XDXDXD he is always there!
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Wait wait wait wait.. does that mean that Junghyuk Yu was thinking of Dokja when he died?! Whoa.. cuteee
58,"Jul 28, 2021",the omniscient reader web novel has 551 chapters. As the wabtoon is following the path of the webnovel and one episode is being released every week it would take approximately 10 years to reach to the end. GET READY FOR THE RIDE OF THE DECADE!!!!
58,"Sep 18, 2021",ilhun is handsome ngl
58,"Aug 5, 2021",Why is it they can’t see the pretty face Dokja has 😐
58,"Aug 4, 2021","its late, but HAPPY BIRTHDAY YOO JOONGHYUK!!! our angry, tsundere, bastard sunfish!! 🎉🎉✨"
58,"Jul 29, 2021","If level 3 requires both parties to be thinking about each other, doesn’t that mean joohyuk was thinking about dokja!!!"
58,"Jul 29, 2021",Everyone saying Dokja is ugly 😂😭
58,"Jul 29, 2021","Dokja's loyal viewers in my eyes - prisoner of the Golden headband : protective older brother, Secretive plotter : the neighborhood taboo, Uriel : Uriel, ABFD : the chuunibyou next door"

58,"Jul 28, 2021","Huiwon is his most trusted friend so far, and not taking her to the battle seems reasonable"
58,"Jul 28, 2021","i know they're not endgame, but junghyeok thinking of dokja and there also being a canon bi character is getting my hopes up lol"
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Lol I love every time Dokja does something and the dokaebi freaks out!!!

58,"Jun 23, 2021",Btw that Ilhun dude is pretty good looking 
58,"Jun 23, 2021",LONGEST 2 WEEKS OF MY LIFE
58,"Nov 12, 2021",So our dear main character was thinking of Dokja? :)
58,"Oct 19, 2021","Honestly I think that huiwon and dokja’s relationship is similar to a sister and brother relationship more than an actual person elation ship, because they don’t show any signs to liking one another but only caring for one another- if you get what I mean"
58,"Oct 6, 2021",dokja sleeping according to her: “mommy…. sorry….. mommy…. sorry”
58,"Aug 17, 2021","The fact that I really said “ooh, I wouldn’t mind being *his* concubine” when I saw how smoking the tyrant king is 🤦‍♀️ I’m so ashamed of myself rn oml "
58,"Aug 5, 2021","Huiwon thinks you're cute, she admits it. Everyone else was saying he wasn't very handsome not long ago 😂"
58,"Aug 4, 2021",Huiwon and Dokja's relationship is soOOOO cute and funny at the same time.

58,"Jul 29, 2021",when you realize the comic has 6.9 million likes
58,"Jul 28, 2021",What if all of this is just exrta writting of TWSA and Dokja is the new MC?
58,"Jul 28, 2021",dokja be like *mommy*
58,"Jul 28, 2021","Dokja seem to have a clear line between characters and humans, whoever he can view his attribute window is a character and if not is a human. But even sangah and lee gilyung ( the humans he saved) are slowly becoming characters either in his view or in reality. "
58,"Jul 28, 2021",petition for this masterpiece to be turned into an anime fr
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Huiwon the savage and confident queen ❤️
58,"Jul 28, 2021",We Stan a bi king 😩✨👑
58,"Jul 28, 2021",All these people be shipping Dokja and Huiwon but the real OG's know that the Demon King of Salvation X The Director of the False Act is the OTP
58,"Jul 28, 2021","""I guess you might end up as a slave, Dokja"" ""The same could be said about you, Huiwon""

High level insults right there (￣▽￣)"
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Ngl Huiwon looking fine on that last panel 🥵
58,"Jul 28, 2021","Dokja saying ""what's wrong with her?"" and Huiwon saying ""what's wrong with him?"" says a lot about their established friendship. 😊"
58,"Jul 28, 2021","I thought the plot was just meta but it seems to be far more complicated than that with the whole ""real world"" getting mixed with what's supposed to be in universe fiction. Also liking the fact that there's some bi representation even if it's from one of the bad guys"
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Awww so that means Junghyeok Yu was thinking about dokja when he used omniscient reader’s viewpoint!
58,"Jul 28, 2021","Man, Huiwon is so beautiful! Plus, it seems their friendship might blossom into something a bit more dear. I love the teasing they're doing to each other. I'm shipping them! "
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Can we please get Dokja some clothes? Huiwon without her robe just feels wrong.
58,"Jul 25, 2021",I really really like the supporting cast of this toon everyone is so cool and likable 
58,"Jun 28, 2021","I just finished reading the novel… well, the ending is not my type but definitely a genius way of ending a story… I recommend y’all to continue reading this story, y’all are in for a ride. "
58,"Jun 25, 2021",Did I just go thru 25 coins to get here? Yes.And where did that Get me? Another cliffhanger 😭
58,"Jun 23, 2021",soooo was yu thinking of dokja during that one scene? kinda sus
58,"Jun 23, 2021",That last panel had me over here going bi panic mode ngl
58,"Jun 23, 2021","Lmao ""DO YOU HAVE THE CON MAN ATTRIBUTE?!"" Love the dokkaebi channel conversations "
58,"Jul 29, 2021",(Everyone knows that the Reader and the Protagonist definitely have to be in true love)
58,"Jul 28, 2021",so basically when dokja was inside junghyeok ...Junghyeok was thinking about dokja...and u ask why we ship them????
58,"Oct 4, 2021",hey my Dokja is not ugly at all Huiwon!! you are mistaken!! HAHAHA 
58,"Sep 30, 2021","Okay so, the level three of [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] is where Dokja can enter a character's body and experience their surrounding. One of the conditions to activate it that both the character and Dokja needs to think about each other. So when Dokja entered Jungheok Yu's POV, they were thinking about each other? "
58,"Sep 30, 2021",sangah putting a blanket over him aw :( she's the mom of the group!
58,"Aug 6, 2021","Dokja's flashbacks to his mother and his sleeping habits revealed in this chapter has me really suspicious and wondering, what exactly was his past and how does it relate to his mother? I am thoroughly enjoying the plot right now! cant wait to see what happens next!! "
58,"Aug 6, 2021",Btw.. I wonder if this webtoon will have 3149 episodes

58,"Aug 1, 2021",How many of y’all don’t read the instructions for the scenario anymore??
58,"Aug 1, 2021",Reminder that it's YJH's birthday on the 3rd of August.

58,"Jul 30, 2021",Ok I know this isn’t a romance WEBTOON but I ship Huiwon x Dokja
58,"Jul 29, 2021",How Dokja comes up with these plans is beyond  me now .........me like
58,"Jul 29, 2021",Literally always shook by how HOT Junghyeok is 
58,"Jul 29, 2021",imagine if he just wakes up and this was all a dream. . .
58,"Jul 29, 2021","Heewon and Dokja arguing is so funny, she’s so out of pocket as always and I hope she continues as she is 🙏."
58,"Jul 29, 2021",Plot twist: You were all characters from the beginning! 😈😂
58,"Jul 29, 2021","I've had this theory for a while that Dokja regresses somehow into a 2nd life and pretends to be the Yu that we see here in this comic, ultimately saving his past self and friends, but sacrificing his older, regressed self by the end of it. Maybe that's also why Dokja can see You in first person. because they're the same!!"
58,"Jul 29, 2021",Someone give that guy some pants
58,"Jul 29, 2021",Did I ever mention how much I love huiwon

58,"Jul 28, 2021",Dokja is shameless as always I see
58,"Jul 28, 2021","Seeing how the entire story is 1000 coins and a fastpass = 5 coins, maybe there is gonna be 206 episodes, 4 extra from the beginning of the series where fastpass was not available and 2 from the start of each season (assuming there are 3) and 200 from the 200 fastpasses seeing as 200*5 = 1000 and that's how much the copies sold for"
58,"Jul 28, 2021",[the constellation god of 🖤ships🖤 is surprised that dokja thinks they are both unnatractive. he gifts them both some Valentine's day choclate]
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Huiwon and Dokjas relationship feels like two best friends constantly teasing each other-
58,"Jul 28, 2021","Okay hear me out 🤚😂 Junghyuk just woke up right, and Jihye was wondering if him and Dokja were a couple, so like.. She probably asked Yjk about his child he has with kdj 😂😂 and then Yjk was thinking about Dokja like ""ugh what the hell"" and that's how omniscient reader level 3 happened "
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Y'all gonna stop coming for my man dokja lol

58,"Jun 24, 2021","Im not sure what to say... I started reading OR just today, well here we are, having bought all the 5 extra chapter already... I guess I'll have to go on a break already for a while. ""One thrill seeker has left the stream"" "

58,"Dec 14, 2021",did yall notice when he said that for him to use the 3rd level of his power the person has to be thinking of him. that means that when he was in joonghyuk's body he was thinking of dokja
58,"Sep 28, 2021",Huiwon straight out admitting she thinks Dokja is attractive and he’ll probably become a concubine too lol

58,"Jul 29, 2021",that Samurai girl is a teenager BTW guys so no shipping a younger girl with Dokja because seriously she is under age -_-
58,"Jul 29, 2021",so I don't like forcing ships in non romantic stories but Dokja and Huiwon would make such a power couple especially in this new world!! I thought the coworker would be the one but I really prefer huiwon they fit better for my tastes. 
58,"Jul 29, 2021",That casual Roast from Huiwon lmaoooo
58,"Jul 29, 2021",Is it me or is the Tyrant King kinda hot-
58,"Jul 29, 2021",Is it bad if I low key ship Dokja and Huiwon
58,"Jul 29, 2021",when will he get a proper clothes again????
58,"Jul 29, 2021","Ilhun Kang, his attribute did not blossom thanks to meeting the WRONG SUPPORTING CONSTELLATION] lol and in addition he's still USEFUL 🤣"
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Why do every character call Dokja ugly?🤔🤔
58,"Jul 28, 2021",am i the only one that thinks Dokja is attractive wtf 
58,"Jul 28, 2021",What if at some point Dokja also gets confused if he's either a character or a real person? lol jk just a random blabber but I'm excited for the next eps
58,"Jul 28, 2021",nobody in dokja team is ugly stop 
58,"Jul 28, 2021",huiwon is literally so cool we stan!! In this household we stan badass sword women!!
58,"Jul 28, 2021","OK but Huiwon  and his relationship, so cute! bickering like siblings I love it. and when he was falling asleep and the other girl ( can't for the life of me remember her name??) was covering him with a blanket, cute!"
58,"Jul 28, 2021",give dokja some pants 2021
58,"Jul 28, 2021","ah so people ship dokja and heewon now, i mean understandable, i've always loved their dynamic."
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Honestly I love how they’re slowly becoming more and more comfortable with each other that they’re even insulting each other. Friendly banter is always needed to forget that you’re living in an apocalypse 
58,"Jul 28, 2021","""They say he takes any beautiful men and women as his concubine."" BI ENERGY"
58,"Jul 28, 2021","Huiwon and Dokja’s relationship reminds me of Ash And Misty, they will snap at each other and make jokes about one another, but they care for each other."
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Feel like he's benching Huiwon so that she can take the flag and sneak into somewhere to plant it at the target base.
58,"Jul 28, 2021",i say it every episode and i will say it again .. i love this webtoon so much .. i kinda miss the constellations tho they were so fun
58,"Jul 28, 2021",huiwon and dojka are so funny pls 😭
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Don’t worry Dokja we think you’re pretty- you wouldn’t be a slave (we think)
58,"Jul 28, 2021","Damn, she really called him ugly I-"
58,"Jul 28, 2021",ugly people become slave Meanwhile Huiwon 'then maybe you'll became Slave😂🤣 why don't you directly tells him that he is ugly poor Dokja😂😇
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Ngl huiwon is hot
58,"Jul 14, 2021",Did the artist just do his own thing and make Dokja attractive or something? They've been calling him ugly for awhile now. 
58,"Jun 29, 2021",",🚢🚢 let's Go dokja + huiwon (Dokwon) ❤️"
58,"Jun 24, 2021",how come everyone rags on dokja and calls him ugly I think he's hot.
58,"Jun 23, 2021","Does Huiwon have a crush on Dokja? 1. Dokja saved her life 2. She teases Dokja quite a lot 3. Even though knowing one of Dokja’s secret, she doesn’t tell, or betray him 4. Okay, I’m not 100% sure, but I’m at least 50% sure."
58,"Jun 23, 2021",who else dropped whatever they were doing when you saw the notifs? me. and i’m not ashamed 
58,"Jun 23, 2021","bro about to be the coldest ninja in the story, how is he not leveling up as fast, if not faster than the M.C. of the novel he read since he already knows what's to come?"
58,"Mar 8, 2022","Bro, I realized that Dokja said: “both characters need to be thinking about each other when is doing the 3rd level of that skill”, so that means when he entered in Yu’s body he was thinking about him! I mean, idk really but whatever lol"
58,"Dec 25, 2021","can we talk about the fact that when dokja entered main characters pov in omniscient reader level 3, jonghyuk and dokja had to be thinking about each other for it to work?? im just saying.. but thats kinda sus ngl"
58,"Dec 19, 2021",dokja's smile hahaha
58,"Nov 5, 2021",i like sangah but i ship huiwon and dokja more lel
58,"Nov 5, 2021",ISTG IS IF JUST ME OR DOES THE TYRANT KING FROM THE SIDE LOOKS LIKE AIZAWA SHOTA AJJDHSHSBS
58,"Oct 30, 2021","It's so funny how this chapter emphasizes the blurring of the line btwn Character and Real Person, bc I'm starting to forget which of the main 4 traveling with Dokja are characters and aren't since they've all grown into their own"
58,"Oct 8, 2021",HDJFHKDF HUIKJA?? 😳😳 idk if i ship it tho them staying as friends or staying together romantically both work
58,"Oct 7, 2021",huiwon is so gorgeous
58,"Sep 28, 2021",Does this mean Junghyuk was thinking about Dokja at the time he entered the station?
58,"Sep 23, 2021","Call me weird but seeing Huiwon shocked and wondering in the last panel, she was drawn very well!"
58,"Sep 12, 2021",oh so the tyrant king is bi 👀😏 /j
58,"Sep 10, 2021","man, the art's just beautiful and damn neat to tell apart which characters in this webtoon r beautiful or ugly LOL"
58,"Aug 29, 2021",wait i realized dokja took away that guy's pants to wear it 😭
58,"Aug 14, 2021","Huiwon is so pretty, I am a simp for her"
58,"Aug 13, 2021",huiwon keeps doing him dirty 💀
58,"Aug 5, 2021",she's so pretty:>
58,"Aug 4, 2021",Dokja and Huiwon are both my favorite characters so far. Great chapter
58,"Aug 3, 2021",It's Yoo Jonghyuk's birthday! Or at least where I live.
58,"Aug 3, 2021",LMAO “do you have the con-man attribute” DOKJA MIGHT AS WELL
58,"Aug 1, 2021",new here happy and sad to be caught up. ready for the 10 year ride 
58,"Aug 1, 2021",Too bad he can't kill anyone. I was hoping for a slaughter 
58,"Jul 31, 2021","I love the level 3 mode! He’s getting so much stronger I feel like a proud mother watching him grow :,)"
58,"Jul 30, 2021",Is it me or is the tyrant king HOT.... yeah  it's definitely me 
58,"Jul 30, 2021","I know this ain't that kinda story, but I love the interactions between Dokja and Huiwon 😅🥰"
58,"Jul 29, 2021",mc being insulted even tho he handsome af
58,"Jul 29, 2021",how is huiwons hair still looking so epic 💔💔 my hair would be limp and oily asf by the third day
58,"Jul 29, 2021",i kinda ship huiwon and dokja lol
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Why she diss him like that 💀
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Sometimes I wish Dokja's dokebi would show up invisible to anyone but him instead of communicating through a chat box. 
58,"Jul 28, 2021",This episode started out a bit meta. Can’t wait to see if Dokja finds the answer to the question who are the real people! 
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Dokja just casually starting a war this episode
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Huiwon is bae
58,"Jul 28, 2021",I didn't expect the tyrant king to be attractive 💀
58,"Jul 28, 2021",i love the sibling relationship mechanic between huiwon and dokja😭☝️☝️☝️
58,"Jul 28, 2021",my fave is when dokja gains an increased understanding of characters
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Huiwon and Dokja throwing shade at each other gives me LIFE
58,"Jul 28, 2021",the crazy thing is that al of them are character in real life. or we are character too?
58,"Jul 28, 2021",i be forgetting half these mfs names💀
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Dokja.... ugly? 🤨 Someone needs to have their eyes checked... 
58,"Jul 28, 2021",I love how this whole arc Dokja's just been taking things from everyone 😂😂 looks like this episode it was Pildu's laptop 
58,"Jul 28, 2021",dokja isn’t even bad looking 😭😭😭
58,"Jul 28, 2021","Damn, Huiwon is so savage...I want to be like her 😕"
58,"Jul 28, 2021","They made heewon extra pretty in the last panel ,I love her ❤ ,hope she gives some badass fights in future "
58,"Jul 28, 2021",why does everyone diss my boy Dojka?? he's not ugly at all lol
58,"Jul 28, 2021",wouldn't it be a great plotwist if the reason why dokja can't read sangha's profile is bc she's related to the author? i feel like she has a bigger part than we let on
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Man I’m suddenly curious what Sangahs been thinking/feeling this whole time. She’s been pretty quiet and we haven’t seen much with her
58,"Jul 28, 2021",So level 3 is basically y/n 
58,"Jul 28, 2021","for a korean webtoon, I'm really enjoying the bisexual representation ^o^ even if it's a tyrant king LOL"
58,"Jul 28, 2021",“i guess you would be a slave then” that’s true friendship right there 
58,"Jul 28, 2021",I like Huiwon's humor 🤣
58,"Jul 21, 2021",Well worth the 5 coins what a chapter 😃👍
58,"Jul 16, 2021",👀 Maybe because Huiwon is a hecking goddess and he wants to protect her from being a concubine target (but so is the really smart peach hair lady so maybe not) 
58,"Jul 11, 2021",N E E D MORE OF HUIWON AND DOKJA... M O R E... 
58,"Jul 1, 2021",omg min jiwon faint feelings for dokja 🤣 she should've fell for junghyok yuu not dokja
58,"Jun 30, 2021",our girl jhw is one of the most badass characters! can't change my mind
58,"Jun 28, 2021",Everyone who will read this until the end will become part of this story.
58,"Jun 26, 2021",what's wrong with Huiwon is that she's starting to catch feelings for you Dokja
58,"Jun 24, 2021",Jung Heewon I am in love with u😌
58,"Jun 24, 2021",What is with these people's standards???? Am I the only person that thinks Dokja is hot???
58,"Jun 23, 2021",Yay so glad it‘s back!! Also lol that dude still doesn’t have any new pants haha
58,"Jun 23, 2021","Now I'm suspecting that in TWSA Huiwon dies in the battle at Gwanghwamun. Please don't kill her, she's one of my favorite characters 😥"
58,"Jul 28, 2021","""I guess you might end up a slave, Dokja"" Translation: ""You're ugly, Dokja"" x)"
58,"Jul 28, 2021",bi tyrant king
58,"Jun 23, 2021",Just remember! The Author technically said it’s all right to plagiarize as long as you are  plagiarizing the plagiarizer…🤓 smart thinking! Just don’t plagiarize TWSA!!!!
58,"Aug 11, 2022","Both the person and I have to be ""thiking about each other"" WJSBKSKSDHD MY HAND FLEW SO FAST TO MY MOUTH AT THE REALIZATIONS AWWWW"
58,"Jul 28, 2022",I have read through EVERY SINGLE comment and lazybrokeweeb hasn't left a comment 
58,"Jul 12, 2022",the pantless guy 😭😭😭
58,"Apr 27, 2022",Bro do people actually think dokja is ugly bro is handsome as hell I would be happy with half his looks (coming from a straight dude btw)
58,"Apr 16, 2022",Lol thta guy still doesn't have pants cuz dokja took them
58,"Apr 11, 2022",Huiwon and Dokja's relationship is really cute and fun to watch. 
58,"Apr 10, 2022",The tyrant king is a daddy for sure 👁👅👁🤳
58,"Mar 8, 2022",Sooooooooooo the tyrant kings bi
58,"Mar 7, 2022",God dang i just realized seonggok is wearing a underwear 😭😭😭😂😂😂
58,"Feb 20, 2022","i know the dynamics between dokja and huiwon is real in this but i can't help but notice how dokja just built a real underground kingdom with him as the king and huiwon and hyeonseong as the executioner and bodyguard duo, and sangah, pildu and gilyeong as domestic authority of the kingdom. To top it off with ilhun, minseob and mr-no-pants (I'm sorry, poor guy) as dokja's special task force."
58,"Dec 22, 2021",it's funny how Dokja's looks are made fun of cuz I find him handsome.
58,"Dec 9, 2021","Ik this isn’t likely to be the case, but I like to think that the reason Junghyuk (sorry can’t spell)  was thinking about Dokja when he first entered lvl 3 was because Jihye asked if they had a child together once he woke up."
58,"Dec 1, 2021",i fucking hate the spoilers in the comments 😀
58,"Nov 24, 2021",anyone else ship junghyeok and dokja 
58,"Nov 18, 2021",dokja isnt ugly what are these characters on
58,"Nov 18, 2021",Huiwon is so funny and amazing lmfao best female character so far
58,"Nov 17, 2021","did dokja says the tyrant would take a beautiful man and woman right?


i bet the tyrant king is a bisexual is✌️😎"
58,"Nov 16, 2021","is it weird that I ship Dokja and Junghyeok, for some reason or am I just going crazy???"
58,"Nov 11, 2021",Dokja : what’s wrong with her?Huiwon minutes later : what’s wrong with him? 
58,"Nov 8, 2021",HIM IN HIS BOXERS LOLL
58,"Nov 7, 2021",It's completely understandable that Dokja was thinking about Junghyeok but what about Junghyeok why did he suddenly thought about Dokja?
58,"Nov 2, 2021",i wondered where dokja got his pants and then I saw one of the revelators in his boxers...🤣
58,"Nov 2, 2021",if using the lvl 3 ability requires them thinking about each other... then junghyeok was thinking about dokja when that happened huh
58,"Sep 22, 2021",please someone give seongguk pants 😭😭 each panel just kill me
58,"Sep 11, 2021","Dokja truly is so very clever… so clever indeed. LOL THE SHADE! He’s not even that ugly… poor Dokja, average just isn’t enough. Huh. Wasn’t the Tyrant King supposed to be a delinquent like Namwoon? Oh right. Then that means those two are on their way"
58,"Aug 30, 2021","Oh. No wonder yu junghyeok would think about kim dokja when he just woke up. Before he fainted at the theater dungeon, it was dokja who said things that shook his heart. Knowledge and personal relationships in yjh's past regressions are things that nobody but himself should've known."
58,"Aug 25, 2021","“I guess you would become a Concubine Dokja” Huiwon knows how beautiful this man is, I love it here"

58,"Jul 28, 2021",I just realized.. It's been so long since I've seen the sky in this comic
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Report all the comments that have nothing to do with the story. They're just people who are desperate for likes.
58,"Jul 28, 2021","omg, i laughed everytime dokja mentioned the first prophet ""plagiarised"" TWSA"
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Sometimes reading this story reminds me of chemistry at some point there’s so much going on you don’t even know if you get it anymore
58,"Jul 2, 2021","I don't know Dokja, I think Huiwon would end up a concubine if it weren't for her attack everything personality"
58,"Jun 30, 2021",Huiwon is savage
58,"Jun 30, 2021",am i the only one to realized she was watching him sleep a tru girl thing to do
58,"Jun 29, 2021",I love how Dokja and Huiwon indirectly called each other cute when talking about  the tyrant king taking cute males and females as concubines
58,"Jun 29, 2021","Junghyeok better start trusting Dokja soon,the whole thing will go soooo much more smoothly"
58,"Jun 26, 2021","I know the update is long already but I'm a greedy constellation I want more. Still, thank you for the team who's making this webtooon! It's so freaking lit! "
58,"Jun 24, 2021",Dokja really is better at this than he let's on. 
58,"Jun 23, 2021",smel like a death flag
58,"Jun 23, 2021","Imagine if this webtoon ended, and then BOOM, some sort of apocalypse happens..."
58,"Jun 23, 2021",one of my favorite oarts was when he got asked if he had the Con-man attribute. lmao. that totally seemed like something i would have done too if i was in his position. lmao. cant wait for more
58,"Jun 23, 2021","gotta say, this is my favorite manhwa for some reason"
58,"Jun 23, 2021",The constellation “impatient reader” is yet again obsessed with this series. 5 coins given.
58,"Jun 23, 2021",whelp I have erred I broke down and payed 25coins later and way past when I should have gone to bed. oops
58,"Jun 23, 2021",Wait…so is his level three skill like some kind of inception ability?   Or more ghost like.  
58,"Jun 23, 2021","Things are starting to get intense, I wonder who’s gonna win"
58,"Jun 23, 2021","*happy noices * Its back!! interesting development with people becoming characters instead of just being in the books story, I wonder if that's going to be an important detail later on? at the moment it with Dokja's skill ots a good way to tell who is a reader and who is a character. "
58,"Aug 13, 2021",tbh I think I like  Dokja and Huiwon  to be of a friend relationship because I cant imagine Dokja being lovely dovey to Huiwon i just cant imagine it 
58,"Aug 11, 2021",GUYS DINT FORGET TO LIKE!!!
58,"Jul 29, 2021",guys sb he said that to activate level 3 both people must be thinking of each other so does that mean that jonghyuk was thinking about dokja the first time he entered main character POV. SB HELP ME IS THIS TRUE?
58,"Jul 29, 2021","Honestly, I think that Huiwon and Dokja would be a lovely romantic relationship. A lot of commenters seem to forget that romance can exist without it being insanely lovey and cheesy. They could easily get together and keep the same vibe they have going now :)."
58,"Jul 28, 2021",Worried about his mom my ass... no spoilers tho :)
58,"Jul 28, 2021",I'm sure Huiwon will misunderstand him thinking he likes here and is trying to protect her😜😁😄 (not that I'm complaining.😂)
58,"Jun 23, 2021","Everyone in this chapter like ""what is wrong with ""insert the pronoun here"""". lol. Also, WDF with that ""Tyrant King"" clothes and does he have horns?? I'm not sure if a love it or I hate it. btw, I wonder if Doka will ever change his clothes?"
58,"Sep 18, 2022",Huiwon be saying that Dokja will end up as a slave but there is a copy paste of Dokja right near the king's throne lol
58,"Aug 20, 2022","""the character and i have to be thinking abt each other"" so does that mean that yjh thought of kdj the moment he woke up when kdj used level 3 on him 😳"
58,"Jul 27, 2022",I think it's kinda funny how Heewon thinks Dokja es BELOW mid yet they look exactly the same in my eyes 💀
58,"Jul 9, 2022",only if huiwon saw novel dokja 
58,"Jul 9, 2022",the one dude is litterally just in his underwear lmao
58,"Jun 18, 2022",well I am supporting there relationship ☺️
58,"Jun 3, 2022",It really took me 30+ chapters to realize how precious and cool Huiwon is
58,"May 28, 2022",i love this story i cant stop reading it this is my new favorite webtoon
58,"Apr 24, 2022",Everyone calls dokja ugly lolol
58,"Mar 27, 2022",Huiwon and Dokja are like besties for years 😭😭will have your back go down hell for you but annoying the shit out of you at the same time
58,"Mar 24, 2022",I don’t know why people call Dojka ugly like in my opinion he’s the hottest guy on there 
58,"Mar 2, 2022",bisexual king 💖💜💙
58,"Feb 28, 2022",so... delusional moment here cause i came back to reread and dokja said the omniscient viewpoint stage 3 only works if both people are thinking about each other.... so that means junghyeok was thinking about dokja when he was able to see junghyeoks pov 😩😩😩 sorry ill see myself out-
58,"Jan 9, 2022",THE WAY HUIWON JUST IMPLIED DOKJA IS UGLY AND THAT HE'LL BECOME A SLAVE 😭😭
58,"Jan 5, 2022",Anyone still ship Jeonghyuk x Dokja? Please...
58,"Dec 29, 2021","""Both the character and I have to be thinking each other""😯😍"
58,"Dec 24, 2021",Wait... so does that mean that... junghyeok was thinking about Donkja? 😏 😏 
58,"Dec 20, 2021",Dokja is wondering if Minseob and Seongguk are real people or characters without knowing that they are all characters of this fiction.
58,"Nov 26, 2021",Tbh if Huiwon was with me when I slept I’d probably be saying mommy too
58,"Nov 26, 2021",I got here back after a year 'cause I heard Dokja and Yu are most likely to become the cannon ship of the series let's see how this goes I really don't want either of the females(mostly Huieong) to become the female lead so I guess I'm fine with anything as long as none of them are the fl
58,"Nov 13, 2021",I think a side effect of character pov level three is it makes you speak what you are most worried about while using it.  
58,"Nov 13, 2021",Diversity win! The evil Tyrant King is Bisexual!

58,"Nov 3, 2021",Wait actually what? She lives because of her fighting like she literally protects them with her sword
58,"Oct 29, 2021",Dokja doesn't have the con man attribute he IS the con man attribute
58,"Oct 15, 2021",I wonder if his ability to see Seonguk Lee & Minseob Jung's character profile is because they accepted the death oath to not act individually anymore. Making them part of the story instead of ability to change it.
58,"Oct 14, 2021",lmaooo huiwon HAHAHHAHAHHA
58,"Sep 29, 2021",best duo ever huiwon and dokja
58,"Sep 26, 2021","frankly I'm afraid that everyone will slowly become characters and if all this ends they will disappear or die, I hope not but you can never know"
58,"Sep 13, 2021","Ahh yes you are Puppet Master Dokja's puppets. Dance for him! Lmao ""Do you have the con-man skill!?"" Awww Huiwon and Dokja are at it again. And she was watching over him as he slept. How sweet. I love those 2 together. Interesting, none of the main characters can be told they're in a novel but I wonder if that applies to Sangah, Gilyeong, and Huiwon. Or how Seongguk and Minseob were added as character. Are only reader's shielded by it? Dokja did mention the 4th wall keeping him trapped. "
58,"Sep 13, 2021",i smell a potential ship :D
58,"Sep 11, 2021",Dokja and Huiwon subtly complementing each other 👀
58,"Sep 8, 2021",lol this is awesome I really like this Webtoon and all the characters in it 
58,"Sep 7, 2021",Day 57 of voicing all the characters 
58,"Sep 4, 2021","i think there's an error in the translations,,, it should be CONSTELLATIONS who gifted their INCARNATIONS the file, not the otherway around since the constellations are the sponsors"
58,"Sep 1, 2021","so.. based on the conditions, was junghyeok thinking about dokja in the previous chapters... 👀 go mom and dad"
58,"Aug 28, 2021","Well then, if people have to think about him for lv 3 to work then you know what that means. Junghyeok is just digging himself a deeper hole. 😂"
58,"Aug 27, 2021",so yjh was thinking about kdj😳😳😳???
58,"Aug 25, 2021","Okay but the Tyrant King looks like a mix of Shota and Yami, and the banter between Dokja and Hui is literally the sibling one, their dynamic is being siblings 😭😭"
58,"Aug 21, 2021",Loll!!! soon that Dokkaebi's braincell is going to split cause of Dokja hahah lmao! he was asking if dokja has Conman attribute😂😂😂😂

58,"Aug 8, 2021",took me a while to digest everything
58,"Aug 7, 2021",That part about the 2 people have to be thinking about each other is kinda sus cuz that would mean dokja and yu musta been thinking of each other thats just mega sus

45,"Mar 10, 2021","Poor Pildu getting the Inuyasha treatment lol and Hyunsung has big golden retriever energy, it's adorable~"
45,"Mar 10, 2021",Lmao dokja like pls let me hit U while I still can 😂🥺
45,"Mar 10, 2021",so......they changed probability into feasibility???
45,"Mar 10, 2021",History's most intense game of capture the flag is about to begin
45,"Mar 10, 2021","If this series ever gets popular enough to have official merch, I want a plushie of Bihyeong the Dokkaebi."
45,"Mar 10, 2021","“pildu, do a backflip”"
45,"Mar 10, 2021","Ah, so this is why he wanted Pildu. No one gonna mess with their flagpole now. "
45,"Mar 10, 2021",there's a certain aesthetic to a ballistic vest and a sword that I don't think I appreciated enough until I started reading this story. It's an odd marriage of tactical and fantasy but I honestly love it. 
45,"Mar 10, 2021","censorship, ruining watchers days even in the Apocalypse "
45,"Mar 10, 2021",Heongseong’s expression is my golden retriever’s reaction to getting a new dog toy lmao
45,"Mar 10, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" is crying over the excessive filter and demands star stream to fix it.] [The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" is getting hyped that the 4th scenario has begun on the channand will continue to support the incarnation kdj.] [5 coins have been sponsored.]"
45,"Apr 28, 2021","i think the best way dokja can describe his ""power"" to the others is: ""i know a version of the future where i do not exist"""
45,"Mar 10, 2021",Sit boy! 
45,"Mar 10, 2021","Dokkaebi: Hi constellations and welcome BACK to my channel! Today's video is sponsored by Galacticzon, use my promo code DokkaebiKing for 15% off your next purchase! Now let's kill some humans!!!"
45,"Mar 10, 2021",Wait so all while Dokja is getting shit done the main character is sleeping?  ain't no main character of mine.
45,"Mar 10, 2021","""Dokja has become the leader"" me: but like wasn't he always?"
45,"Mar 10, 2021",Well it has been done. I am now broke but happy. They say money can’t buy happiness well apparently they haven’t read this manhwa 
45,"Mar 10, 2021",Listen to me imagine all of this is actually the future of our world and we would have to play dokja like he is doing to everyone else or we would be an elite group that already knows what happens in this world
45,"Mar 10, 2021",Let the more-violent-than-usual capture the flag.....    BEGIN!!!!!
45,"Mar 10, 2021","Either this scenario will be a bloody mess or Dokja will convince the other station to submit. Either way, I'm here for it [THE CONSTELLATION, RICCO VAN WILDER, IS EXCITED AT THE THOUGHT OF THE COMING ANARCHY] [YOU HAVE BEEN GIFTED 5 COINS]"
45,"Mar 10, 2021",Dokja being a savage to Pildu lol. I like this dude so much.
45,"Mar 10, 2021",Huiwon is best girl still 
45,"Mar 17, 2021","Ok but can I just say, this webtoon is really top tier. Storyline is amazingly creative and well written, and art style is also really good. I really love Dokja too, I rarely like main protagonists this much.I can not wait for the new episode. Keep up the good work! "
45,"Apr 28, 2021",bruh when Dokja puts his hands on his hips he gives off bad bitch energy
45,"Mar 10, 2021",Why be a king when you can be named the True Monarch 
45,"Mar 11, 2021","King Dokja. That's got a nice ring to it. 
Capture the flag means new faces! excited to see how our main protagonists' skills will develop during this scenario."
45,"Mar 10, 2021","Booo we want HyeonSeong as companion, look at his innocent smile. We need to protect it"
45,"Mar 10, 2021",if I was in their shoes I wouldn't have left😭 as long as I survive with dokja I'll stick to him like glue💀
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Dokja should just get adoption papers for Gilyeong to become his official dad at this point.
45,"Mar 10, 2021","""Constellations have massive wealth and power."" Constellation ""Herald of the Black Dawn"" begs to differ as she tosses in the last of her coins."
45,"Mar 10, 2021",i love this comic
45,"Mar 11, 2021",did dokja just became a hundred times more hot or is it just me?

45,"Apr 28, 2021",Hyeonseong looks SO HAPPY with that new shield lmfao
45,"Apr 28, 2021",dokja literally posed like a model every other panel and i couldnt take my eyes off it lol
45,"Apr 15, 2021",I live for the relationship between Dokja and the Dokkaebi 🤣🤣
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Am I the only one who thinks dokja looked cute when he shrugged 
45,"Apr 28, 2021","It’s not a huge deal, but in the original novel feasibility is actually probability. Which is kind of important since it sounds a lot better in the later chapters. It’s not too much of a difference but it would be nice if it could be changed! There’s no pressure though!"
45,"Apr 28, 2021",I swear he looked at that shield like a dog looks at a frisbee😂😂😂
45,"Mar 17, 2021","This is one of the best moments in the novel, especially regarding Kim Dokja and Jung Heewon’s relationship in the future 😭 (and also because of the misunderstanding Lee Jihye had, which is in the next chapter of this manhwa 👀) "
45,"Mar 11, 2021","Dokja: Pildu. SIT, BOY!"
45,"Apr 27, 2021",I am so shipping dokja and huiwon ♥️♥️♥️ they look so good together
45,"Apr 28, 2021","“I want you to be my companion” Damn, Dokja, are you trying to make the story a bit spicy? 🥵 "
45,"Apr 28, 2021",uGh all i could think about was how cute dokja and gilyeong’s relationship is 🙃💢
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Huiwon and dokja with their kid is adorable. Their whole group is like this cute (incredibly badass) little family 
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Oka I’m sorry but are we not gonna talk about Dokja and Gilyeong, like as soon as Dokja realized that Gilyeong was sleepy he held on to him. Like these two give me father and son vibes and it’s so adorable ☺️ "
45,"Mar 10, 2021",Can you please change feasibility to probability please 😭😭 it's gonna sound weird later 
45,"Apr 29, 2021",he said let’s play capture the flag but make it ✨deadly✨
45,"Apr 29, 2021","""I own him"" kinky"
45,"Apr 28, 2021",lmaooo junghyeok and dokja really do radiate bff vibes i love them
45,"Apr 28, 2021",“I’d like to smack him on the head once more” sent me 😂
45,"Apr 28, 2021",dokja's sassy shrug was EVERYTHING 
45,"Apr 28, 2021",He was so happy to get a new shield!!😆😆
45,"Apr 28, 2021",I love this so much. I’m so intrigued from the last chapters about fictional characters being real: is it all a huge parallel and am I actually a character in someone’s book?
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Doja making moves on the girl my man 😂
45,"Apr 28, 2021",At the end of this webnovel wouldn't it be cool if the last thing we saw was a person reading a book called The fourth way to survive an apocalypse and it was done by the maker of TWSA
45,"May 1, 2021",I came for the coins but stayed because I got obsessed and I need more NOW
45,"Apr 28, 2021","... remembering ""Capture The Flag "" from Percy Jackson...."
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Why did they blur instead of using black boxes? There are things in the novel which are represented by black boxes which cannot be simply blurred out so I hope they change this.
45,"Apr 29, 2021",Hyeonseong is baby and has a 100% crush on Dokja
45,"Apr 28, 2021",THE KING’S ROAD ARC IS HEREEEEEEE ITS HAPPENING YALL 😩😩‼️ SO MF EXCITED
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Damn bruh, Why Dokja so sexy🥲 "
45,"Mar 10, 2021",We'll we'll.... good to know we are the constellations as well. Now take my coins! give them to Dokja! Also absolutely love the fact Pildu is being sat like InuYasha!
45,"May 10, 2021",... Dokja knew about this. That's why he leveled up Pildu. Pildu is gonna hold that station like a boss while they take the others.
45,"May 8, 2021",can you imagine having to play capture the flag for 10 damn days during the apocalypse?? just kill me 
45,"May 2, 2021",I read this webtoon for participating in a event to earn 5 coins but Now I am investing those 5 coins in this webtoon only 😂😂
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Dokkaebi to others : Herald of MiseryDokkaebi to Kim Dokja : Manager
45,"Apr 28, 2021",New waifu unlocked: Huiwon 
45,"Apr 28, 2021",the dokkaebi gets Cuter in each new episode 
45,"May 3, 2021",Hey but I have a question... what ARE the three ways to survive an apocalypse???
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Actually Kim Dokja can step on me too. why tf is he hot like this when he's being a bstard 😂❤
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Pildu will be extremely useful regarding the defensive part of this main scenario
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Gilyeong and Dokja's father son relationship makes my heart warm uo
45,"Apr 28, 2021",So uh... is our Naval Warrior princess not going to ask Dokja how the hay he knows certain information?
45,"Apr 28, 2021",I will protect Hyeonseong smile!!! Anyone who tries will get this Full Cowling
45,"Apr 28, 2021","I wish it was black box cus it feel more meaningful and why would they change it to feasibility , probability is better . Its clear that the translationer doesn't read the eng novel but i get it since they are busy with other manhwa"
45,"Jun 10, 2021",I've been trying to stop myself but I'm gonna say it now -- JUNGHYEOK IS FRIKIN PRETTY !! look how he sleeps like a damn princess 
45,"May 7, 2021",i hope dokja gives another a-grade item to hyeonseong so we can see that reaction again ☺️
45,"May 7, 2021",hyeonseong when he got his new shield is just 🥰🥰🥰
45,"May 3, 2021",I feel happy that I have started to read omniscient reader. Thanks to the webtoon coin earning contest cuz of this I came to know about this webtoon. Who r all started to read it and become a fan of it just by seeing the contest ?
45,"Apr 29, 2021",AHH FINALLY THE KING ROAD ARC HAS FINALLY BEGUN! I'M SO EXCITED ><!!!
45,"Apr 28, 2021",this is really making me wanna go read the webnovel 😅
45,"Apr 28, 2021",I swear Hyeonseong looked like a kid on Christmas when he got that new sheild
45,"Apr 28, 2021",So looks like the next scenario is going to be like capture the flag but instead its capture the territory 
45,"Apr 28, 2021",hyeonseong's puppy face. He's so precious omg
45,"May 17, 2021",HYEONSEONG AND HIS PUPPY FACE IS SOO ADORABLEE
45,"May 4, 2021",i was reading this webtoon just to get free coins but now i'm obsessed
45,"May 2, 2021",i want a dokkaebi plushie so bad :c
45,"Apr 30, 2021","You all do realize that he wasn't the only one to read the story, right? The others just stopped at some point before it ended. He's probably going to run into some other ""readers"" sometime soon."
45,"Apr 30, 2021","I have ignored this webtoons for so many months because I thought it would be a dumb, typical comic about a guy getting a group and fighting evil and blah blah blah. now that I have read it, though, I have fallen in love. thank you, author."
45,"Apr 28, 2021","if anything happens to Hyeonseong, we riot."
45,"Apr 28, 2021","""can U stop inching away from me"" 😂"
45,"Apr 28, 2021",The parts with Pildu always make me laugh so much but sheeeesh this is gonna be an intense game of flag. 
45,"Apr 28, 2021",I love how dockage doesn't try to be the perfect kind hero and just tells people how it is and let's them decide how to deal with it. he's so cruel I love it❤
45,"Apr 28, 2021",So.... Capture The Flag it is
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Why is the filtering like that...the black boxes looked way more cooler and it had a meaning too...like in the epilogue....and what the hell is feasibility...I mean come on!!
45,"Sep 1, 2021",This series gives me actual goosebumps lol...I’m an American who lives in Seoul and watching them move through the stations that I pass by on the daily is fascinating. Even more so as they’ve gotten so close to station I live near by! Such an amazing story :) 
45,"Aug 2, 2021",Is it just me or Bihyeong's getting cuter with each chapter?
45,"May 6, 2021",This is the most intense version of capture the flag I have ever seen.
45,"May 5, 2021","Sometimes I wish to pet that dokkaebi or use him like a pillow , you know my home having a pillow crisis right now 😹😹"
45,"May 5, 2021",Hyeonseong's reaction when he gets a new shield😭💕
45,"May 2, 2021",Am I the ONLY one incredibly interested ind Sangah?! Like I dunno bout you guys but I have a very suspecting feeling there’s MUCH more to them than what meets the eye
45,"May 1, 2021",So are they basically playing a huge game of capture the flag?
45,"Apr 30, 2021","pildu, play despacito "
45,"Apr 30, 2021","I’m still tryna decide whether the author is the cause of this apocalypse, or if they’re like a prophet and just foretold all these oddly specific events🤔"
45,"Apr 29, 2021",sometimes I forget that Hyeonsong is a military man. He is just so cute and precious whenever he is thankful or goofing around Dokja. 
45,"Apr 29, 2021","Feasibility??? But I'm already used to ""probability""!!! AND WHERE IS THE BLACK BOXES FOR THE FILTERS/CENSORSHIP???/?/??/?/?/?/ GIVE IT BACK TO US!!!!!"
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Look how he smiled when Dokja got him a new shield! 
45,"Apr 28, 2021",hold on i just realized webtoon didn't change the “I'd like to smack him on the head once more.” thank you webtoon translators🛐
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Puldu down ! *casually walks and takes the flag* that scene was soo cool😂😂😂
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Woah I went back to read the first chapter and there are a lot of references that now I can understand... time passes so fast ;-; but I’m glad I started this wonderful story!
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Okay so I want to guess which one is the author among the characters that had been introduced... My guess at first was Anna Croft but he doesn’t know Dokja. I re-read Chapter 1 and Dokja used his real name when sending the author a ‘Thank You’ message. So my pick would be Sangah. She was also using her phone when Dokja was emailing the author. Plus there are moments wherein I feel like she knows something. This is just me guessing ‘cause I’m really excited 😂 I hope we’ll find out soon...
45,"Apr 28, 2021",I really thought she was pouting from how it looked in the thumbnail.
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Gilyeong being glued to Dokja this chapter 🥺
45,"Apr 28, 2021","so we gonna see a deadly capture the flag, kinda like Percy Jackson"
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Dokjas so damn sassy i love it
45,"Apr 28, 2021","NOOOOOOOOOOO IM CRYING..... THEY CHANGED ""PROBABILITY"" INTO ""FEASIBILITY"" AND IT PHYSICALLY HURTS"
45,"Apr 26, 2021",I JUST FOUND THIS WEBTOON AND ITS SO AMAZING I'VE STAYED UP FOR 3 HOURS READING THIS AND PROPS TO THE AUTHOR BECAUSE ITS AMAZING!!!!
45,"Jun 8, 2021",Kim dokja said that huiwon wasn’t in the variable of the story “he” created
45,"May 6, 2021",Pildu....SIT BOY!
45,"May 5, 2021",Am I upset that I caught up?? Yes. Do Hyeonseong’s little puppy eyes make it feel okay? OBVIOUSLY 
45,"May 4, 2021","Dokja : ""Hyeonseong! Catch!"" hyeonseong : excited puppy eyes*✨✨✨ I'm like- WHeezeeee** 😂🤣"
45,"May 1, 2021","it would've took approximately 60 years and 150 days for all of ""Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse"" to be complete if it was uploaded once a week"
45,"Apr 29, 2021",Lol Junghyeok looks so soft for once in that panel where Dokja says he wants to hit him again. 
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Wouldn't mind a chubby, dangerous looking, dokkaeibi doll. "
45,"Apr 28, 2021","capture! the! flag! ever since pjo came out that i have viewed that game in a different light, clearly it is ✨for the elites✨ 😤"
45,"Apr 28, 2021","*STOMP* “Woops, sorry, didn’t see you there” lmaaaaaaao 🤣💀👏🏻"
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Im waiting for THAT scene, novel junghyeok x dokja fans would know."
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Dude they have to play for 12 DAYS. This is gonna be one hell of a ride!
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Can I just mention how much I love the word 'companion'. Like it's like really close friends but not romantic. It's like deeper than just like platonic. I just love it so much.
45,"Apr 28, 2021",they way hyeonseong's face lit up after getting the shield waa so cute 😍
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Hyeonseong's sparkling eyes🥺he's cute
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Dokja you madlad, you can't tell someone that they were supposed to be dead and then expect them to make critical decisions 😂😂"
45,"Apr 28, 2021","""pildu, fetch!"""
45,"Apr 28, 2021",can we just appreciate how long every chapter is and how beautiful the art is?
45,"Mar 16, 2021","Feasibility isnt a bad translation but compared to probability its harder to understand. We can infer meaning from probability since people in general use ""probably"" and ""probable"" a lot more. I barely hear the word feasible used in conversation.  I hope people dont get too confused on what it means. "
45,"Oct 4, 2021","huiwon and dokja's relationship is great, it's platonic with no forced romance :) "
45,"Aug 6, 2021",Oh my hyunseong such a cute puppy ◡̈ 
45,"Aug 4, 2021","starting a petition to buy hyeonseong as many shields as he wants , even if we go broke"
45,"Jul 14, 2021",bru the kid has to be my favorite character like we got mini god of insects knowledge and lightning here we need more of this and I want this to be an anime solo goddam Baaaad 
45,"Jun 8, 2021","Dokja you smooth talker with that ""It's the opposite actually"" of yours."
45,"Jun 6, 2021",🐕 pIlDu dOwN 🐕
45,"May 20, 2021",Hyeonseong’s face when he got a new shield he’s so precious 
45,"May 19, 2021",i know this doesn't have romance but AGHH i just love the relationship between huiwon and dokja.
45,"May 13, 2021",“pildu down”
45,"May 13, 2021",Did anyone else see the John Wick poster?? Can’t help but feel bad for whoever went to that one😅
45,"May 4, 2021","can we like the chapters the likes have gone from 99;999+ to 70,000"
45,"May 4, 2021",OH NOOOOO I'M CAUGHT UP 
45,"May 3, 2021",me heart goes 💫flutter flutter💫 everytime I see Hyeonseong's eyes ✨glitter glitter✨
45,"May 2, 2021",All Pildu needs now is a collar and leash to complete the 'I own him' look. ☺️
45,"May 1, 2021",I binged this so hard. So many hours. It hurts to stop.
45,"May 1, 2021","Hyunsung is so adorable, he's like a puppy!"
45,"Apr 30, 2021",ok istg if I'm the last person that reads this webtoon I'm gonna hide in a bunker for the rest of my life
45,"Apr 30, 2021","I was just here for the coin rai, ik what I’m gonna spend on it now *sigh* I need to buy a gift card"
45,"Apr 30, 2021",I got impatient waiting for new chapters so I started reading the novel. This Capture the Flag arc is so awesome. Coming back from chapter 332 I’m looking forward to reliving it. 
45,"Apr 29, 2021","Lol, huiwon is literally the wild card, Dokja really said “oops u could hear me😅”"
45,"Apr 29, 2021",I already read this in the novel but I wanna see how this is like in picture so I'm here 👁️👄👁️✨
45,"Apr 29, 2021","omg what, I binged 44 episodes. this is too  good!!"
45,"Apr 29, 2021",I wonder what others who heard their filtered conversation thought about them!!!;)
45,"Apr 29, 2021",is it just me or dokja keeps getting hotter every episode?
45,"Apr 29, 2021",As a light novel reader of this novel I am enjoying this webtoon a lot and I hope for more chapters.
45,"Apr 29, 2021","why does Dokja become sexier?and, does these people ever sleep?"
45,"Apr 29, 2021",I read this story to get 5 free coins and then got completely hooked.
45,"Apr 29, 2021",so I just read 44 episodes in less than 2 days and omg 🤯
45,"Apr 29, 2021",why this brilliant webtoon doesn't have more likes? show your appreciation 😉
45,"Apr 29, 2021","Plot twist: Dokja actually is too powerful to be a king, he must become a constellation Edit: so about that..."
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Omg all these scenarios are so exhausting 😭 I feel bad for them :(
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Can you stop inching away from me? XD
45,"Apr 28, 2021","So, the fourth scenario is a mix of 'King of the Hill' and 'Capture the Flag' basically. 🤔"
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Okay but... my ship between Huiwon and Dokja is totally building up more. And when they held Gilyeong, they looked like two parents taking their kid home from the park 🥺 It was precious. I almost died when he asked her to be his companion (IK it's not romantic, but it made me happy). I think she's the first one he asked so far."
45,"Apr 28, 2021",If Dokja can put Pildu on defense duty around the flagpole doesn't that basically make them invincible? This scenario is basically won already. I am concerned about our sunfish being left alone after the recent events. 
45,"Apr 28, 2021",not at me lowkey shipping Hyeonseong and Dokja together lmaooo
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Me: Time to buy some more coins, bank account: 0000000000, Me: NOOOOOOOOOOOO"
45,"Apr 28, 2021","""the shield...is for me? 👉👈"" -hyunseong"
45,"Apr 28, 2021",People who read the novel (me): *laughs internally* 😂 + looking forward to Dokja’s new look soon after this scenario 
45,"Apr 28, 2021",OMG- HYEONSEONG'S CUTE FACE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE DAICHI-
45,"Apr 28, 2021","“We may have to risk losing something dear to us” please don’t be anyone on the team, I love them ;__; and also I forgot Dokja could control Pildu 😂 "
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Hyeonseong really is a labrador 
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Lee hyunsong is adorable , like a teddy bear or a puppy ☹️💕"
45,"Apr 27, 2021","So from what I know now, dokja is pimping a fluffy demon baby, an engineer from tf2, and the god that said engineer represents. I'm down to see who's next."
45,"Mar 10, 2021","Wednesday’s are a great day for me, not for my wallet! "
45,"Mar 10, 2021",[The Constellation Die-Hard Fan donates 5 coins.] The constellation also cant wait to see what happens to Pildu.
45,"Apr 28, 2021",*costellations have massive wealth and power*-------- just like our boi Lazy Broke Weeb.
45,"Sep 19, 2021","I just wish they would change the blurred words with '◼️◼️' and maybe 'feasability' to 'probability' just like what the novel used. As a novel reader, i'm especially very familiar with these 2 because it's been used a lot in the novel, and maybe 'dokkaebi shop' to 'dokkaebi bag' too. It just somehow made me uncomfortable and strange😅"
45,"Aug 3, 2021","why is Hyeonseong so cute, he's my favorite 🥺"
45,"Jul 31, 2021",and in the end dokja was the really the author of the novel he is been reading
45,"May 14, 2021",i luv hyeonseong aww😭
45,"May 5, 2021",the look on his face when he got a shield 
45,"May 3, 2021",Agh I read this all in one sitting now I’m pacing around and I keep checking my phone as if it’s gonna update randomly 
45,"May 3, 2021",Oh god this is gonna be a long arc
45,"May 3, 2021","ong this would be a banger anime, this needs to get animated for crunchyroll 😂🤝"
45,"May 2, 2021",I literally just read all 44 chapters in 1 1/2 days.... I’m a new reader 
45,"May 2, 2021","OMG, Hyeonseong's face when he got the shield😍🤧"
45,"May 1, 2021",I hope Dokja and Huiwon relationship isn’t awkward and i hope they become better companies and not just give and take. 
45,"May 1, 2021",this needs to be a streamed series cause I'd pay for the 🍵
45,"Apr 30, 2021",Itd be funny if he ended up stronger than the protagonist
45,"Apr 30, 2021","Dokja is such a sassy, manipulating little genius ❤️ one of my favourite protagonist ever and by far "
45,"Apr 30, 2021",I literally read this from chapter 1 to now in one day instead of revising for my exam tomorrow and I literally have no regrets
45,"Apr 29, 2021","What if this is all KDJ’s imagination cause he fell asleep on the train at the beginning of the final chapter? Like he could be in an Inception style dream where he’s able to make changes, but I was restarting the comic and the though crossed at episode 2"
45,"Apr 29, 2021",Why is dokjas body so fit-? 
45,"Apr 29, 2021","I would love to see this turn into an anime series or a movie, I’d totally pay to see this or watch it at a series "
45,"Apr 29, 2021",all i can say is that im super hooked on this series and all the commotion makes me want to read the novels
45,"Apr 29, 2021",Have you noticed that Dokja is worthy?! True king. 
45,"Apr 29, 2021","Hyunsung is adorable, he's just like a puppy. ❤️☺"
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Honestly I have a really bad feeling about this. Basically Dokja hasn't yet lost even once. But I don't want anyone to die! I'm too attached to the characters in his group...
45,"Apr 28, 2021","I winned 5 coins with the event, guess where I'm spending them again :) "
45,"Apr 28, 2021",i've been reading ahead with the novel and lemme just say this- reading the manhwa here gives me that Fourth Wall feel to it- knowing the future and seeing it evolve here. 10/10 !!!
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Look at LHS reaction when he received the shield 🥺
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Anyone else wonder how Dokja charges his phone??
45,"Apr 28, 2021",adorable hyeonseong🤣💗
45,"Apr 28, 2021",I predict that pildu will become one of the greatest assets to the team in the future 😤
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Dokja's aim in life: To smack Junghyeok on his head while he still can
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Hyunsung is like an adorable golden retriever
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Heongseong's face expresion is me when getting my favorite gummies and chocolate mix lol i love him 
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Guys the previos episode was what happened in the prologue :o, also i really want this to be animated this series is amazing!! Btw if you read the prologue you can see Gilyoung with his mom and it really makes you realize what he’s been through :,l"

45,"Apr 28, 2021",is that a confession? 
45,"Apr 28, 2021",I'm so obsessed with this.
45,"Apr 28, 2021",The bleeped video had me dying😂😂😭Is it werid that I kinda feel bad for Pildu...Dokja waiting to get his on hit on the regression (dont know how to spell his name😔)
45,"Apr 28, 2021",hyeonseong.... puppy....
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Huiwon I think is pretty much my favourite character at this point. I love her energy and how straightforward and moral she generally is. I think she’d make a good friend. A partnership between her and Dokja would be a smashing combo I believe. 
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Dokja in this chapter is pretty, hot and sassy what more do you need?"

45,"May 10, 2021",Can you stop inching away from me
45,"May 8, 2021",So...capture the flag on apocalypse levels?
45,"May 6, 2021",losing something dear to us?? Please dont take Gilyeong from us he's too precious
45,"May 5, 2021",Dokja is totally the coolest !!!🤩🤩
45,"May 5, 2021",I like this so much because it is the thing that has got me to like webtoon and is the only thing i read weekly.
45,"May 5, 2021",dangit. i caught up 🥺
45,"May 4, 2021",I love this fandom
45,"May 4, 2021",Did anyone noticed dokja carried the mjolnir in his hands while carrying gilyoung in his back from the theatre
45,"May 3, 2021",I feel kinda bad for pildu but at the same time he deserves it
45,"May 3, 2021",noooooo I need more!
45,"May 3, 2021",Hm... shoot I caught up 
45,"May 3, 2021","Hyeonseong is like a puppy, I can't with his cuteness~"
45,"May 2, 2021",When Heonseoung got the new shield it was so mf cute
45,"May 2, 2021",so were just gonna ignore that dokja was holding  Mjollnir 
45,"May 1, 2021",Just can't wait for 10 more years for all the chapters to come out 😅👍
45,"Apr 30, 2021",I'm so glad Coin Raid event made me pick up this webtoon. I read it all in one go and now I'm dying for more. [Constellation Dulkia is sleep deprived after binge reading this webtoon and will proceed to catch some 💤]
45,"Apr 30, 2021",so it's basically capture the flag but instead of capturing the flag it's more like capture the base. ( looks at all my times playing halo ) that shouldn't be too hard to do 😏
45,"Apr 30, 2021",I hope they change Feasibility back to Probability. It’ll just sound so weird in future chapters with ‘Feasibility Storms’ - I really don’t think this term was something that needed retranslating?
45,"Apr 30, 2021","So it's a Capture The Flag game, but a more extreme version. If you read the rules of the game, you can already tell whats gonna happen. OUR BOY IS GONNA GET AN ARMY!!!"
45,"Apr 30, 2021","When you decided to start after there were multiple episodes so you could binge-read, only to find yourself at an abrupt ending causing you to wait another week-"
45,"Apr 30, 2021",dokja you are so handsome.... ..and when you shrugged....OMG😍
45,"Apr 30, 2021",Can we just stop and appreciate how cute hyeonseong is?
45,"Apr 30, 2021",when u were here just for coins but now u are addicted ( ╹▽╹ )( ╹▽╹ )( ╹▽╹ )
45,"Apr 29, 2021","Dokja is so bratty and hateful to Pildu, it's BEAUTIFUL. i love him"
45,"Apr 29, 2021",just wanted to say: this webtoon made me love the series so much that I started reading the webnovel as well. And I come here from chapter 73 of the novel to say that Dokja is the only man to ever matter 🙏
45,"Apr 29, 2021",When you use the coins you earned from reading this series to fast pass this series🤣
45,"Apr 29, 2021","hmm I don't know why they change the '◼️' to just blurred words for the sensor/ filter, but I still prefer the black boxes because it was that iconic and... meaningful. or they change it to distinguish the mere filters and the '◼️◼️'? well, both are filters but just blurred words as filters didn't held the same weight and impact as those black boxes though, especially when the boxes weren't just a symbol or manifestation of filters, but literally had meaning relevant to the plot"
45,"Apr 29, 2021",hyeonseong. best. boi.
45,"Apr 29, 2021",woah ...i was gonna read this webtoon only till epi 20 for coins but it was so good that i actually reached till here...and will read this until the very end^^
45,"Apr 29, 2021","I originally read this just to complete the coin raid, but here I am now reading all the episodes in one sitting 😏 I'm addicted!! 🙉🙉"
45,"Apr 29, 2021",lol... sucks to be you Pildu 
45,"Apr 29, 2021",so a huge game of capture the flag of this couldn't go wrong in aaaaaaaaaany way
45,"Apr 28, 2021",i will go cry myself to sleep for a week goodbye
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Hyeonseong is so adorable! That’s the kind of guy I want!
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Everyone turned into Lego heads when Dokja said Pildu couldn’t come. 😂
45,"Apr 28, 2021",So the future is changing as he is taking over all the shit so dominantly... I  wonder
45,"Apr 28, 2021","I’m a fan of Huiwon, love this webtoon so much and dokja and the others are so cool"
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Constellation ""Dokja Simp"" is awaiting for the next big scenario wholeheartedly "
45,"Apr 28, 2021",The scenes where dokja orders around pildu are sooo hilarious🤣
45,"Apr 28, 2021",I only found this series 3 days ago and I love it already I just kind of wish I would have found it later just so I wouldn't have to wait for new episodes lol
45,"Apr 28, 2021",The way I laughed everytime dokja just commanded pilau lmaooo golddd
45,"Apr 28, 2021",He owns a human life now. that's neat
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Now this is how capture the flag is supposed to be like
45,"Apr 28, 2021",my guy bout to be a king with a queen i can already see it
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Why do I find that floating gremlin cute?
45,"Apr 28, 2021",I ship hyeonseong and dokja I just though I should put that out here
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Pildu’s essentially Dokja’s dog now and it’s hilarious 😂
Edit: not even a dog never mind lol"
45,"Apr 28, 2021",HUIWON BEST GIRL
45,"Apr 28, 2021",ok the best way I'm which this comic can end ....the author writes at the end that after 5 mins omniscient reader will become paid ಠ‿ಠ ...I sometimes wonder if only I'll the one reading it till the end and get to be the protagonist and meet dikha lol 
45,"Apr 28, 2021", King Dokja has a nice ring to it👑
45,"Apr 28, 2021",So protecc hyeonseong he’s too precious
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Reading this on my birthday!
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Hyeongsong is such a big softie my heart exploded when his eyes sparkled when Dokja gave him a new shield
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Dokja is having way too much fun ordering Pildu around 
45,"Apr 27, 2021",Love the fact that he isn't a sissy. He's being ruthless to make sure he'll survive all the way to the end. I like it
45,"Apr 27, 2021",[Supportive Reader] smiles at the update. You have been gifted 5 coins.
45,"Apr 22, 2021",Dokja becomes more and more lovable with each episode
45,"Mar 10, 2021",The look of approval from Dokja to his 'property' for gaining stats is priceless
45,"Mar 10, 2021",Had to take coffee to wait for new episode and still had to use my cash... That's what you do when you're in love. Damn this manga is a blast

45,"Mar 10, 2021",the landlords all looked like bobbleheads when they learned Pildu wouldn't be allowed to leave 🤣
45,"Oct 16, 2021","pildu, bark."
45,"Sep 11, 2021",Bihyeong is way too adorable looking to also be scary 
45,"Sep 8, 2021","Lmao ""down Pildu"" is the greatest scene ever 😂 Dokja had to rub in salt in the wound by stepping over him and calling him his property. Huiwon and Dokja. 2 variables not meant to exist in the story along with some of his other companions. I do like how Huiwon teases him but also really admires him. Favorite ship, be my companion"
45,"Aug 31, 2021",did anyone notice the John wick poster 🤔 
45,"Aug 30, 2021",they almost haven't slept since this started... same as me.
45,"Aug 6, 2021",the huiwon x dokja ship is sailing well
45,"Jul 30, 2021","even though dokja knows basically all information about twsa/their new world, i still wanna clap his plans and strategies in knowing those info and turn it in his advantage. I mean even if i know all of those info like him, im sure i still wouldn't be able to plan 10x ahead like what he's always doing. "
45,"Jul 28, 2021","I also want to be in this weebtoon and have a give and take relationship with Huiwon,I'm definitely simping for her.🙃"

45,"Jun 30, 2021","Oh wow so what Dokja said earlier got filtered, interesting. It looks like he caught the eyes of truth seekers constellation. Haha Huiwon heard everything he said lol. Of course, Dokja would be the leader. LMAO Pildu can't run away from Dokja. Haha hyeonseong is so happy. Ooh so Dokja is going to make new allies. I wonder who's the 5 people who left. What an interesting and fun scenario."
45,"Jun 25, 2021",Guess this is gonna be like the reverse of capture the flag from percy jackson Huh? I'm excited!
45,"Jun 22, 2021",dokja is like a bug in a game that disrupt the entire system. if if it's a real game you need force stop the game and back at the checkpoint but in this case they need to kill junghyuk first to get rid dokja off
45,"Jun 1, 2021","What if he says,”pildu from now on you have to call me master” lol that would be just cruel 🤣"

45,"May 2, 2021",I just realized that Dokja was carrying the hammer while carrying the kid(forgot the name but his power was related to insects)
45,"May 2, 2021","hmm. it's weird. you know, they aren't the only humans stuck in this. As readers, i feel like we've become desensitised to the fact that the other contenders are no different from the MC. the other humans from the other stations may also have constellations. it's soo sick that they are being toyed with for the entertainment of higher beings :/"
45,"May 1, 2021",Did anyone else see Dokja holding the hammer when he was carrying Gilyoung?
45,"May 1, 2021",Sometimes I think I should hate Dokja but I love him all the time. I relate to this character on another level.

Like I would feel safe if I was part of his group"
45,"Apr 30, 2021",Not sure how I feel about “Probability” being changed to “Feasibility”

45,"Apr 28, 2021","I love how our antihero looks out for his friends. Even though he went for the quest and earned rewards, he made sure to get something for the two who were left behind. And also when the first thing he was looking for was the sword that he excitedly gave to Huiwon! "
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Please change feasibility to 'Probability' like it was in the the novel. It just makes way more sense. I can take all the other wrong translations but this is too much. Keep 'Probability' same !!!!! Please
45,"Apr 28, 2021","so, basically they're playing capture the flag, but with danger in the mix! how exciting! ...really though, i'm interested in how dokja will act as leader. i feel like he's done a good job so far, but at the same time, will he become more ruthless as time goes on? it kind of seems to be going in that direction imo."

45,"Sep 13, 2021","I don't know why but I feel like at the end of the weebtoon someone will just close the book and be like ""that was the story of the apocalypse 😭"""

45,"May 20, 2021",Inuyasha vibes anyone?
45,"May 19, 2021",Huiwon is actually pretty smart to ask if she is a liability for knowing to much right off the bat. It's gotta suck finding out someone can read the future but says they don't know yours because you were already dead in the one he knows though.
45,"May 19, 2021",HE IS CARRYING MJÖLNIR!!!!!!!
45,"May 19, 2021",Now I know why I love Hyeonseong so much!!! His happy face is so adorable!!!x3
45,"May 13, 2021","Did anybody else notice the statement ""a variable that wasn't in the original story that i've created""?  I thought he read the story and didn't write it?"

45,"Apr 29, 2021",Wow this is just starting right up huh. No breaks in the action! I feel like this capture the flag scenario could be super cool if handled properly so I'm excited to see what happens...

45,"Apr 28, 2021",Dokja is a total savage 😂😂
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Dokja said something that made me think, whoa that's a spoiler!!! What?? Why would you say that?!? How would you even know that at this point?!?! And then I realized it was just a misplaced modifier. Oops."
45,"Apr 28, 2021","The terms ""working together"" and ""finding  a leader"" with your enemies will absolutely NOT go well"
45,"Apr 28, 2021","kagome is that you? ok... the lecherous monk got less lecherous,  there's an animal kid, they even have a tortured demon slaying sango with a thing for monks robes... there's an obnoxious emo sorta- family member who's entirely op... kaede got significantly hotter... there's a morally ambiguous anti hero who slices things up but has a redemption arc... nm, checks out, carry on, kagome, the haircut suits you"
45,"Apr 28, 2021","He is changing fate! Instead of Jeyong, he is using knowledge from the story . I wonder if the final boss will be the person who wrote the story in the first place? What if Jeyong is the writer and he knows Dokja should take over instead of him?"
45,"Apr 28, 2021",when u want to screenshot a scene so bad but this is webtoon 🙂
45,"Apr 28, 2021","""Down, boy!"""

45,"Apr 28, 2021",Hyeonseong is adorable. 
45,"Apr 28, 2021",idk if it’s just me but dokja is... taller?? than in the beginning of the series? perhaps it’s the ballistic vest but he looks to be built different. I’m assuming it’s the art style adjusting to his newfound confidence and prowess. quite interesting eh? how the turns have tabled... from a timid office worker to a prospect king of the apocalyptic world.
45,"Apr 28, 2021","I like the new TL: ""feasibility"" - makes more sense in English given what it's describing. "
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Noooo, webtoon change probability to feasibility 😭😭😭 please keep the translation to probabilty, I am too used with probability term. even when the novel translator change, it still use probability"
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Hyeongseong looks like a little kid with a new toy from Christmas he's so adorable!!!

45,"Apr 28, 2021",HIM SHRUGGING AND THAT CHUUNI BANGS ARE SENDING ME JDKDNSKNSKS
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Dokja really said ✨M I N E✨
45,"Apr 28, 2021",My theory is that because dokja is changing so much of the original story that by the end he wouldn’t be able to ‘predict’ anything and it’ll be an “in the moment” thing
45,"Apr 28, 2021",bro my dyslexia kicked in and all I read was flag flag plant blah blah blah flagpole flag T-T

45,"Apr 30, 2021",I don’t understand how it says failure to complete is ??? When it also says if they don’t plant the flag in the directed flagpoles the whole group will die. So wouldn’t the penalty for failure be death?

45,"Apr 29, 2021","With the way that scene was shown... I can't help but wonder if Biyeong might have put a romantic undertone to the become my companion"" scene"

45,"Apr 28, 2021",Damn I was never good at capture the flag
45,"Apr 28, 2021",that sassy shrug dokja 😂
45,"Apr 28, 2021",OMG capture the flag has started. this is my favourite arc because this is where i feel the story really takes off!
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Feasibility? Wouldn't it be probability?
45,"Apr 28, 2021",When your life rests on a variation of capture the flag. 
45,"Apr 28, 2021",I wonder why dokja said that huiwon wasn't in the future? does it mean there is a probability of her death in the early stages? I hope dokja saves her...
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Dokja just went ""down"" and just ended Pildu's entire career 😂😂😂"
45,"Apr 28, 2021",dokja went from a 4 to a 10 waaaay too quick

45,"Apr 28, 2021",DAMN IT!! I HEKKING DID IT AGAIN! I REALLY NEED TO STOP SPEED READING
45,"Apr 28, 2021",So the chat can be filtered too? That's interesting. The author of TWSA is way too OP to even prevent a dokkaebi from hearing.
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Pildu, make minute rice in 58 seconds"
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Quick, Dokja, bust out the phone-----"

45,"Apr 28, 2021",Is it just me or does the does the dokkaebi look like that one character from Tower Of God?
45,"Apr 28, 2021",dokja as king oh boy this is going to be funny
45,"Apr 28, 2021","To sum it up, in the next episode we'll be seeing a game of capture the flag! TO THE DEATH OF COURSE!"
45,"Apr 28, 2021",oh no its gonna be a crazy round of Capture the flag... kinda
45,"Apr 28, 2021",elected leader? that doesn't seem too democratic 
45,"Apr 28, 2021",what does it mean when Dokja said Huiwon didn't see him as a companion? Does she not trust him?
45,"Apr 28, 2021",dokja really being smart with ordering pildi around 😂
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Ngl, I'm getting Call Of Duty Capture the Flag vibes"
45,"Apr 28, 2021",Paint a skull on the flag!
45,"Apr 28, 2021",yep.. nothing like being forced to play capture the flag to the death or death... epic..
45,"Apr 28, 2021",[The constellations of the nebula 'WEBTOON' are displeased with the change from 'probability' to 'feasibility']

45,"Apr 28, 2021",when you find out your companion knows the future and then you find out you dont even exist in said future.

45,"Apr 26, 2021",I'm so excited for the new episode! the author and artist did an outstanding job on the Manga. I can say with true confidence that I'm completely addicted! keep up the great work I'm excited for the new episode!!!🥰
45,"Apr 26, 2021",both Hyunsung and Pildu give off dog energy. Hunting is a golden retriever and Pildu is a chihuahua
45,"Apr 25, 2021",main scenario ## - webtoon takes all my money 
45,"Apr 22, 2021",Dokja is the cutest omg. 
45,"Apr 22, 2021",Pildu went from landlord to lackey in just three episodes I can’t wait to see what happens next!
45,"Apr 21, 2021",hyeon is so cute XD
45,"Apr 21, 2021",dokja just be like Stay down! Shut up for 30 minutes!
45,"Apr 17, 2021",😂😂😂. I don't like Pildu but isn't that a little too much? But it is funny-
45,"Apr 16, 2021",HNNNNN I’m so hooked on this story it’s not even funny ㅠㅠ 
45,"Apr 15, 2021",It’s about to go DOWN
45,"Apr 15, 2021",dokja is giving kagome vibes with those commands lol
45,"Mar 25, 2021",How do these guys get unlimited energy to do Neverending scenarios? 
45,"Mar 19, 2021","Ok, but it was really smart of Dokja to bring back items to reward those who stayed behind. This further cements their loyalty, keeps them from feeling like they ""lost out"" on items because they didnt come with, AND continues to strengthen those at his side, who might later save his skin when he needs it most. "
45,"Mar 16, 2021","Penalty for failure ""??????"" aka ""Eh, you're boned. Just haven't thought about HOW boned yet...."""
45,"Apr 28, 2021","WTH is going on.? The translation is going downhill fast. First they change Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship to Blue Star Weapon Aura, Outer Gods to Aliens... Now Probability to Feasibility?!?!?!?!?! That sounds so dumb, especially later on in the story it's going to sound so stupid."
45,"Apr 28, 2021","Feasibility.... no no no. I cannot imagine having to read ""feasibility storm"" or ""feasibility sparks"" it hurts so much."
45,"Mar 10, 2021","I didn’t take you as a companion, i took you as the blob of ink that messes up the words in the book"

45,"Mar 25, 2022",this my favorite arc😭💖🫀
45,"Feb 28, 2022","Dokja's so... dominating, like woah... 😳 that dude is the reason i can never state my sexuality with confidence, and i always end up saying, ""i don't know"" when asked-"

45,"Jan 24, 2022",the white horned guy has such a marketable quality to him. If he was a plush he'd sell like hot cakes.
45,"Jan 21, 2022",I’m honestly suprised I haven’t seen a single shipper 
45,"Dec 16, 2021",do they all know they're in a novel? seems like it
45,"Dec 5, 2021",ok but i know dokja is rlly handsome but his side profile + serious expression is something else dude. also yay ctf!! i've always been fond of ctf games and stuff so im excited to see where this is going! and yes hyeonseong has rlly big golden retriever energy + the way his eyes lights up 😔
45,"Nov 28, 2021",companion=gf/bf dokja has a gf and bf now/hj 
45,"Nov 12, 2021","With the new power of control he has and Pildu, I think he is trying to stock pile assets to protect himself, so that he can reach the end.  "

45,"Oct 14, 2021",hyeonseong is a himbo and he has a crush on dokja I've decided. loving their whole group. huiwon is my favorite so far.

45,"Jun 1, 2021",THIS IS SO EXCITING
45,"May 8, 2021",If only solo levelling had this much long chapters
45,"May 6, 2021",part of the instructions said if they don't plant the flag by deadline everyone will die but in the penalty section it's all ??? so does that mean the leader penalty is undetermined
45,"May 5, 2021",So the translation decided on ‘Feasibility’ instead of Probability? Interesting decision. I wonder why 
45,"May 3, 2021",in no way I am able to sail a ship with dokja
45,"May 3, 2021",this is interesting 
45,"May 2, 2021",LHS IS SO PRECIOUS OMG

45,"Apr 30, 2021",the penalty for failure isn't death
45,"Apr 29, 2021",somehow this scenario remind me of the room that can't be trusted arc from tog. and i'm not alright with it

45,"Apr 28, 2021",Well I read all the episodes of these series but none of them got counted towards the coin raid event. But I did find a new webtoon to obsess over.. 
45,"Apr 28, 2021",I guess that now the future is changing little by little then at the end the things dokja read will be changed vastly..... just a assumption 😅
45,"Apr 28, 2021","wait, if huiwon heard all that stuff dokja shouted at junghyeok, shouldn't jihye have heard it too? they were basically together while dokja was fighting junghyeok "

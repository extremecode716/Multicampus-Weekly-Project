Episode,Date,Review
100,"Apr 13, 2022",HE IS A COMPANION OF MINE!? WHY WEBTOON. WHY CAN'T YOU KEEP THE ORIGINAL. HE IS MY COMPANION??
100,"Apr 13, 2022",who? who can you possess? my guess is the little girl
100,"Apr 13, 2022","Junghyeok: *calls dokja his companion* ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Dokja: ITS BECAUSE OF THE MONEY, HE WANTS COINS"
100,"Apr 13, 2022","ok but the ""sigh, i've died again"" took me OUT"
100,"Apr 13, 2022","I wish they kept the original ""He is my companion"" instead of switching it to ""He is a companion of mine"""
100,"Apr 13, 2022",just another chapter of junghyeok and dokja caring for each other 
100,"Apr 13, 2022",figures dokja would have to be seen as dead for him to admit his feelings lol
100,"Apr 13, 2022",Yoo Joonghyuk: He is my companion.Kim Dokja: *shocked pikachu face*
100,"Apr 13, 2022",HE. IS. MY. COMPANION. He finally acknowledged that. üòç
100,"Apr 13, 2022","NOO KIM DOKJA üò≠ DON'T CALL YOURSELF A MERE READER! YOU HAVE BEEN READING THIS STORY FOR 13 YEARS, THE NUMBER OF READERS WHITTLED DOWN EVERY CHAPTER, BUT YOU STILL CONTINUED TO READ IT UNTIL THE VERY END! ALMOST AS IF THIS STORY IS MADE JUST FOR YOU!"
100,"Apr 13, 2022",hea going to use it on the catastrophe isn't he
100,"Apr 13, 2022","DOKJA- He must‚Äôve said that to get the coins‚Ä¶.BRUH, I‚Äôm dead ü§£"
100,"Apr 13, 2022","(1) Ahem, I have a theory. allow me to explain‚Ä¶ *puts on glasses* ü§ì *props up papers* üìë according to the evidence within this episode, it all points to the catastrophe. Even everyone else is saying it in the comments! We all know, because Jughyeok has put that thought into the catastrophe‚Äôs head. She‚Äôs clearly angry about it, the fact that Dokja is considered his companion now. She‚Äôs thinking about Dokja and how she‚Äôs replaced her in some way. In the next episode, it‚Äôs most (go to replies)"
100,"Apr 13, 2022",Joonghyuk you spelled Husband* wrong.
100,"Apr 13, 2022","I know nothing about the structure of the Korean language but I am starting to suspect that whoever does the translations doesn't necessarily keep to the script, and fan translations tend to be more careful about keeping to the spirit of the original text. Skybreaker and Breaking the Sky Sword are not the same. We had a similar issue with Regressors and Returnees. Concerns about some no-context spoiler keywords in the replies. BC ABSTRACT CONCEPTS. Word choices change meanings."
100,"Apr 14, 2022","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" is finally able to loan coins and is ready for the spo---] [The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" collapse after realizing that its already late.]"
100,"Apr 13, 2022","the dramatic flashback of them at the bridge, the dramatic gust of wind blowing kim dokja's hair, and the dramatic line yoo jonghyuk declared. what an episode."
100,"Apr 13, 2022",Oh my god!?! I thought they were rivals or something by the way junghyeok and dokja fight and argue all the time. Guess that's what couples do though üòòüòÇ
100,"Apr 13, 2022",this is so much better than solo leveling 
100,"Apr 13, 2022",Seeing Junghyeok go feral for Dokja was wayyy too good for my heart that early in the morning. Go my dude! It's also nice to have hints of how much Junhyeok changed mentally over his regression through Castastrophe!Yuseung. I really think she was a good idea for the plot and character developments 
100,"May 18, 2022","I really feel bad for the older Yuseung. She sacrificed herself for a man who didn't even pay respects to her after she died, and then that same man is avenging someone he has only just met. Actually, it doesn't even matter that YJH just met KDJ. It's just that Yuseung and KDJ both sacrificed themselves for YJH but were treated differently by him after their deaths."
100,"Apr 13, 2022","""I need to possess someone other than junghyeok who's been thinking about me!"" Uhmm-- I'm willing to be possessed Sir Dokja? I've always been thinking about u, all day all night 24/7 365(‚óï·¥ó‚óï‚úø)"
100,"Apr 13, 2022",Happy 100th episode everyone:))
100,"Apr 13, 2022",Ayeee we back!! And what a chapter this is ü•∫‚Ä¶. Finally he acknowledges himüòç
100,"Apr 16, 2022","ok ok i see that this may not be too much of a difference fr webtoon readers but for ln readers like myself ""he is my companion"" was such a big turning point for me and had me screaming so it's kinda sad :((("
100,"Apr 13, 2022",'cOmPaNiOn' yeah right mateüò≠
100,"Apr 13, 2022",SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS !!! YOO JOONGHYUK CALLED KIM DOKJA HIS COMPANION AHHHH !!! EXCITED FOR THE NEXT EPISODES OMG THIS IS GETTING BETTER !!!
100,"May 18, 2022","I kinda feel bad for the beast girl and the people who fought for junghyeok. I mean from her POV he completely disregarded their deaths, so her anger is justified. I hope we get to see his POV and know the whole story behind it soon."
100,"May 18, 2022",love at first chokehold ‚ô°
100,"Apr 13, 2022","This made my day after having one fantastically $hitty day at work today, thank you for letting me end my day with a grin. Additionally, get ready for a good time."
100,"Apr 13, 2022",T-third person observer!?!? ISN'T THE NAME OF THE SKILL OMNISCIENT READER'S VIEWPOINT 
100,"May 19, 2022","""He's my companion"" *flashes back to when he dropped him off a bridge into a giant sea serpent's mouth* ""see, look at all the fun times we've had"""
100,"May 18, 2022",And history will call them companions
100,"May 18, 2022","I love how Junghyeok runs up to Dokja while dying to save him, refuses to kill Dokja when asked, goes mad after he ‚Äúdies‚Äù, and LITERALLY CALLS DOKJA A COMPANION. Yet Dokja is like ‚ÄúHe MusT‚Äôve SaID iT fOr AlL THe CoIns He‚ÄôlL eaRn‚Äù ü´•"
100,"Apr 13, 2022",i wonder how it must have felt looking at your own corpse omg you dokja got them thick fourth wall ig
100,"May 18, 2022",The first memory that comes to his mind is him chocking Dokja... kinda sus ‚ò†
100,"Apr 14, 2022",My theory is that Uriel isn't gifting coins to Junhyeok because she us too devastated by Dokja's death xD
100,"May 19, 2022","He must've said that because of the coins he'll earn!!""üò≠kim dokja trying to rationalize everyone's affection for him for the 8627472th time:"
100,"May 18, 2022",Dokja: pfft my corpse lol
100,"May 18, 2022",dokjas ability to no homo everything yjh does smh
100,"Apr 13, 2022","Dokja, you dense fool. He's not calling you his companion for the coins!"
100,"May 18, 2022","i love how, when Joonghyuk is about to call Dokja his companion, it flashes back to that one weirdly homoerotic panel for the bridge scene. the whole scene seems to be used to establish Joonghyuk as an asshole, but that one panel where Dokja fuckin SMIRKS at him and tells him that *he's* the one who should be showing him respect,,,,,,,,, is second only to the one where he smiles while Joonghyuk tightens his grip on his neck,,,,, ""love at first chokehold"" indeed"
100,"May 18, 2022",Only Dokja would think it‚Äôs for coins üôÑ our silly precious emotionally stunted KDJ
100,"Apr 13, 2022",he will become the catastrophe shes hella thinking about him
100,"Apr 13, 2022",I'm pretty sure Uriel is enjoying that moment if we ignore Dokja's death
100,"May 18, 2022",I love how he's amused by his own corpse
100,"May 11, 2022","Not even from a shipping standpoint, I'm honestly disappointed they changed the line. It held a lot of weight for me. Also, the rest of the scene doesnt seem to change? he says, ""He's a companion of mine"", kind of implying he has more and yet he hasnt really interacted much with the others? Also in other lines he says just, ""my companion"" which makes it seem like he's his only companion. Theres also the lines where 41st Yuseung is saying, ""What about the others?"". I could be missing something?"
100,"Apr 13, 2022",are we gonna get beast lord vs beast lord????
100,"May 11, 2022",Not Dokja already thinking about how Junghyeok is going to kill him once he revives himself. ü§£ Some things never change.
100,"Apr 13, 2022",This kind of dynamic character development is why this story is so good üò©
100,"Apr 13, 2022",i love how Dokja Kim recently and now by becoming the original MCs only true friend starts becoming the actual MC in his own eyes now
100,"Apr 13, 2022",what if he possesses baby yuseung????
100,"Apr 13, 2022",y'all in the comments need to put your fourth walls back up and chill lmao
100,"May 18, 2022",Joonhyuk Yoo: He is my companion.  Dokja fucking Kim: ...hES DOING IT FOR THE MONEY-  this man needs SO much therapy istg
100,"May 18, 2022",the 41st round junghyeok was acting like a jerk but imagine the pain he had indure to see the same companion of his die again and again man just makes me cry. Also ships aside imagine what 41st round yuseng will be feeling after hearing the word of acknowledgement from her a jerk of master mouth which she would have been dying to hear for someone else
100,"May 18, 2022","""He is my companion."""
100,"Apr 17, 2022",let‚Äôs gooo life and death companions
100,"Apr 13, 2022",Help me. I‚Äôve been trampled over by all the shippers *cough* I‚Äôm seeing the light‚Ä¶ save-me
100,"May 18, 2022",...'he must have said that for the coins' I CANTT GHJGC YOU GRAINS FOR BRAINS HHH
100,"Apr 30, 2022",Aha not me literally screaming on Junghyuk's revenge for his boy- I mean companion.
100,"May 19, 2022",junghyeok: literally fighting an OP Yusung knowing he gonna die and saying Dokja is  his camrade and companion / Dokja: He hAtES mE He wAnT mE tO DiE WhAt iF hE kiLls mE
100,"May 18, 2022",Webtoon please‚Ä¶ stop trying to sweep the ‚Äúcomradeship‚Äù under the rug LMAO
100,"May 18, 2022",I think we should all congratulate Dokja for being the one person who can say with absolute certainty that he is his favorite fictional character's companion üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
100,"Apr 13, 2022","""He is a companion of mine"" *shrieking crying throwing up*"
100,"May 18, 2022",I was sure Junghyeok didn't like Dokja but I guess that's not true...because somehow I don't think it was bc of coins... And I had to laugh at Dokja wanting to see Junghyeok be a little beat up. I'm guessing Dokja's going to take over Yuseung so it could be Yuseung vs herself but it'd be interesting if he could control the catastrophe instead 
100,"May 18, 2022","""he must have said that for coins""..come on dokja ! he isn't like youüòÇ"
100,"May 11, 2022",Yoo joonghyuk throwing a rampage because Kim dokja died* I swear if this isn't love-
100,"May 18, 2022","It's ""He's my companion."" this hits harder than ""he's a companion of mine."" this last one makes it seem like he has many companions. PLEASE CHANGE IT PLEASE üò≠"
100,"May 19, 2022","I know that Dokja and Junghyeok probably would not become a couple, but damn the quemistry is right there, even if it's just bromance "
100,"May 19, 2022",He acknowledged him!!! ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ So he‚Äôs a tsundere cuz he def acted like he hated him. Dokja touched a part of him 
100,"May 18, 2022",Before I continue reading: there's something very poetic about reader not being able to predict the way he himself affect and changes characters around him. You're no longer an invisible reader once you're their companion
100,"May 18, 2022",Guys why is no one talking about the art üò§ Illustrators hats off to you guysss üëèüëèüëè I am enjoying the plot thanks to your hardworküôåüôå
100,"May 18, 2022","""he's a companion of mine"" what, like you have MORE??"
100,"May 18, 2022","Now what was the purpose of changing the line ""He is my companion""? ü§®"
100,"May 12, 2022","Just say you‚Äôre in love with him, Junghyeok"
100,"May 19, 2022",Awwww he misses him ü•∫
100,"May 18, 2022",2 guesses. either of the children. gilyeong is never not thinking about dokjaüò≠
100,"May 18, 2022","possess the catastrophe you effing idiot, noone is thinking more about you than her right now üôà"
100,"Apr 13, 2022",He is gonna possess the catastrophe of floods
100,"Apr 13, 2022",PLEASE BE HYEONSEONG he needs more camera time! our tank boy needs some lovin
100,"May 18, 2022",Im starting to unironically ship Junghyeok and Dokja 
100,"Apr 13, 2022","""He is..."" *flashbacks to choking scene* I'M GOING TO CRY JOONGHYUK, PLEASE DON'T BE SUCH A TSUNDERE"
100,"Jun 11, 2022",DID HE JUST PUBLICLY CLAIM DOKJA AS WIFEY?!!
100,"Jun 10, 2022","""he's a companion of mine"" AND HISTORY SAID THEY WERE ROOMMATES. JUST SAY BOYFRIEND YOU ASS üò≠üò≠"
100,"May 19, 2022","this webtoon makes me giggle uncontrollably like a little school girl, anyone else?"
100,"May 19, 2022",Jgk: He is.../ Me:yesss??/ Jgk: he is....../Me: YESSSSSS??????/ Jgk: he is a companion of mine/ Me: OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE-
100,"May 18, 2022",junghyeok is a tsundere canon
100,"May 18, 2022","everyone losing their mind with the Dokja and Junghyeok ship, while those who readed the novel know the true ship... ""Dokja X the chinese dress"" xd"
100,"May 11, 2022",Poor Uriel. ü•π She missed the best part (;¬¥‡ºé‡∫∂Ÿπ‡ºé‡∫∂`)üëç 
100,"May 8, 2022",Dokja: how can not think  about me‚Ä¶EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
100,"May 6, 2022",Where is Uriel? She‚Äôs missing out on prime ship building material.
100,"May 4, 2022",I'm convinced it's Dokja Junghyeok is falling for in this regressionüòå
100,"Apr 13, 2022",It‚Äôs going to be the author girl I bet
100,"May 20, 2022",Thanks for your concern Dokja but Uriel is currently passed out
100,"May 20, 2022",junghyeok: he is... my boyfriendif he said this I'd flip 3 times and become a fish 
100,"May 18, 2022",junghyeok: i'll avenge my companion dokja: lol he doin it for money
100,"Apr 13, 2022","I want to say it‚Äôs the girl he became the supporting constellation for, but part of me thinks it‚Äôs the plagiarist woman since she dipped out a few episodes ago"
100,"Apr 13, 2022",time to determine who is simping over mc. 
100,"Apr 14, 2022",he's gonna possess the blonde chick im guessing because she's currently jealous and probaly thinking why him and not usü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
100,"Jun 11, 2022",always love the fact kdj manifested hard enough to become his fave's companion

100,"May 19, 2022",i can‚Äôt blame the girl she‚Äôs been serving junghyeok for so long and he hasn‚Äôt called her a companion until she died that must be so heartbreaking 
100,"May 18, 2022",he is a companion of mine yes you terrorist I mean yjh üò≠ this still gives me some butterflies ü¶ã 
100,"May 18, 2022","this just sad, all she wanted was to be recognised as his companion üò≠üò≠üò≠"
100,"May 18, 2022","ngl i remember hating joonghyuk bc of how he used to treat the people who were with him like nothing. yoosung must've felt like she wasn't worth anything to him and then all of a sudden, this dude who she doesn't even know or have any recollection of, gets called by joonghyuk as his companion. "
100,"May 18, 2022",Life and Death companions letssgooo
100,"May 18, 2022",he is now afraid to revive cuz of all the thing junghyuk said about himü§£

100,"May 18, 2022",who is this incarnation? Junghyeok: *thinks about choking Dokja* he's a comrade of mine...     me: that was some gay shiiiiiiiii 
100,"Apr 19, 2022","Hey, real talk. The thing about shipping JongDok is that, shippers ain't pulling anyone's legs just to grab on to something. They censored the webtoon for a reason."
100,"Apr 13, 2022",Bro this is so gay lol. Also I‚Äôm broke now 
100,"May 21, 2022","I'm getting some strong gay couple vibes from the way these two guys are written but it almost seems like the adaptation is trying to sweep the hints under the rug, I wonder if someone made the decision to tone it down for some reason. It's so weird how webtoons seems to swing from full on queer to queer-bating depending on the comic, I wonder if there's some major differences in how the Korean and international publishing branches handle things. "
100,"May 20, 2022",everyone is pissed about the shipping even though it's been a thing since before the manwha even started and there will be even more moments more sexual than this in future chapters
100,"May 20, 2022",My gut feeling is the one in the bottom left of the companions/friends of Dokja shown is possible Heewon 
100,"May 20, 2022","I was waiting for this but they changed the translation üò≠üò≠ what the hell is ""Skybreaker"""
100,"May 19, 2022","Joonghyuk- ""I love him."" Dokja-""He hates me."""

100,"May 19, 2022","ohhhhhh, ohhhhhh, he's gonna do it... it's happening, it's happening, POSITIONS PEOPLE, POSITIONS!!"
100,"May 19, 2022",This has been my favorite Webtoon since I started reading it. Others may have grabbed my attention while it's plateaued. But this one has a way of hooking it's readers consistently.
100,"May 19, 2022",*smirks* I saw that tiny blush of yours Dokja 
100,"May 19, 2022","ACCEPT IT DOKJA, HE LIKES YOU!"

100,"May 18, 2022",ahh hell twitter shipper is here
100,"May 18, 2022","People getting anoyed by the translation... I read that in the translated novel, it wasn't perfect. Maybe this translation is better than the novel. Is there anybody who knows korean who could tell us which version is closer to the original?"
100,"May 18, 2022","Reminder on how to report mistranslations!(since so many people are annoyed at ‚Äúcompanion of mine‚Äù rather than ‚Äúmy companion.‚Äù) If you‚Äôre in the app, go to ‚Äúmore‚Äù(three dots bottom right anytime you‚Äôre not reading) then ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù then ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù (like 5th from bottom-ish).

100,"May 15, 2022",webtoon should have a feature where you can go in debt. so like if I have 2 coins i can still buy a fastpass but will be in three coins in debt and when you get 3 coins they automatically go to the series. maybe a debt limit tho

100,"May 12, 2022","Oh man, I wanted to see what would happen after Dokja died, but now there's a bigger cliffhanger! He really does mean so much to Junghyeok, and I can see how Yuseung would take offense when he just immediately moved on from her own death and she sacrificed so much in her life and after it for him. She's kind of just destroying the world out of jealousy but honestly, I kind of understand her. I wonder if talking to Dokja once he's revived or her child version in this timeline will change her."

100,"Jun 1, 2022","OK so ""he is my companion"" is a better translation than ""he is a companion of mine"" bc FIRSTLY, the former sounds more sincere and direct,  and hence more intimate than the second phrase, which seems more formal and distant. also,  the first phrase makes more sense narratively. Junghyeok is fighting, and it would be easier to say less words and conserve energy. Furthermore he doesn't just call anyone his companion. The shorter sentence would make a bigger impact.  "

100,"Aug 8, 2022",Dokja is just fixing Junghyeok's mess atp. also why is Junghyeok suddenly calling Dokja his companion when he did his previous ones like Yuseong so dirty and who were literally devoted to him? is it for the cheap bl fanservice? makes no sense
100,"May 21, 2022","Homophobic is a word that I despise just as much as ones like ""literally"" or ""triggered""  because it's been overused by the weaklings of the modern world even though fear and distaste aren't synonymous in every context.

Now that that's done, I ship this."

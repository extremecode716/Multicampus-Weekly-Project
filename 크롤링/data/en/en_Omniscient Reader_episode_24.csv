Episode,Date,Review
24,"Oct 19, 2020",I'm happy with this twist. I'm sick of characters who try so hard to stick to the moral high ground. 
24,"Oct 19, 2020",I‚Äôm really interested to see Dokja‚Äôs developement at this point since he‚Äôs clearly not going to be a ‚Äògood‚Äô character. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be straight up evil but I‚Äôm excited to see the extent of his neutrality at the very least. 
24,"Oct 19, 2020","The people: ‚Äúsharing is caring!‚Äù Dokja: I don‚Äôt care ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Edit: just to clarify, I don‚Äôt disagree with Dokja‚Äôs decision, I just thought it was funny how people were trying to get him to maintain a high ‚Äúmoral ground‚Äù but he was just like, nah, this an apocalypse my dudes"
24,"Oct 19, 2020","Finally, a MC that makes the most optimal choice. I've been getting bored of MC's always trying to be the hero."
24,"Oct 19, 2020","For real though, aside from the people Dokja originally saved with the bugs, everyone is a murderer. They have a lot of audacity to be begging for their lives. I‚Äôm down with Dokja‚Äôs pragmatism"
24,"Oct 19, 2020","Wait I just noticed. Look at the panel when Dokja cuts the guys arms, you see that he is facing away from his group. Then look at the last panel, you can see that he has his back now turned to the guy whose arms he cut off and his body is facing towards his group. So that means that this man just cut the guys arms off, turned around, and then look over his shoulder to flex on all these people. XD"
24,"Oct 19, 2020",This really is gonna be the best webtoon on the app. And if they end up making an anime adaption you know it‚Äôll go CRAZY
24,"Oct 19, 2020","I really like the approach to an anti-hero type of character. It‚Äôs nice to see someone who is intelligent but doesn‚Äôt magically make all the right decisions, it makes him seem really human, mostly fending for himself. Great work author, please keep it up. :)"
24,"Oct 19, 2020","Them: Gimme coins!!!Dokja: Why?
Them: Ugh, let‚Äôs just kill him and take the coins.
Dokja: Mistake *slash*
Them: *Pikachu surprised face*"
24,"Oct 19, 2020",I guess the guy at the end there was ‚Äúdisarmed‚Äù eh ehhhh
24,"Oct 19, 2020",lol why didn't he just let everybody know about the 8k coins the cursed guy with the suit has?
24,"Oct 19, 2020",Crowd: give me a refund. Dokja: sorry there is a no refund policy ;)
24,"Oct 19, 2020","""Give us coins"" Dokja: ""I missed the part where that's my problem"" This webtoon along with Solo Leveling is all I am looking forward to every week"
24,"Oct 19, 2020",Crowd: Let me get that.Dokja: Its gone cost you an arm and leg.
24,"Oct 19, 2020",they had time to complete the quest but they where sitting there all that time just crying about it and now it's his fault? pathetic 
24,"Oct 19, 2020",Pretty sure Sangah has Ariadne as her constellation. Ariadne is sometimes seen as the goddess of mazes and is credited with giving Theseus a ball of string to find his way out of the minotaur's labyrinth . I mean that was so iconic from that story it just seems too coincidental. I don't know if a Japanese/korean/chinese  myth involving string exists to provide an alternative. 
24,"Oct 19, 2020","I honestly think that his decision is the ""good""one he needs verification that anyone he gives coins to will at least be able to offer something to him in exchange. If they don't then they wouldn't be surviving very long anyways. If he helped them it would probably just make them suffer longer with no hope of actually surviving and acclimating to the new world order. I mean they couldn't muster 100 coins Dokja gets that much as a gift from the constellations all the time."
24,"Oct 19, 2020","The first theme being Original Sin, would that mean the second theme is Survival of the Fittest? He wouldn't be doing any of them a favor by handing out coins for free, as they would be bound to the other guy. They would rather take the easy path and just kill him, when all they really need to do is offer either an item of their own, or their services in future runs. Its how society is supposed to work in the grand scheme of things, where all parties work at their own pace to contribute. "
24,"Oct 19, 2020",Manager dude got 7k coins last chapter. Let him save the people.
24,"Oct 19, 2020",M8 I think my favorite constellation is the secret plotter
24,"Oct 19, 2020",he's right. he worked for his coins. even with his knowledge he still had to accomplish those things to get an award.  this webtoon touches a lot of areas in society and its great. thank you author for amazing comic 
24,"Oct 19, 2020",[The contellations Webtoon readers are happy with your performance] [You have been gifted 5 coins]
24,"Oct 19, 2020",I think the facts come down too no one has a moral high ground here like he said original sin they all murdered someone to be alive right now so the fact they expect some one to save them after that is ludicrous. No one is good or evil here it‚Äôs just survival for survivals sake.
24,"Oct 19, 2020","Dokja is also not Dokja, I believe he is The Omniscient Reader. otherwise, he would cling to humanity and sins, for example, he would had tried to save as many people as possible, but instead decided to let them choose their fates, he knows what to do and how to do it, instead of morals he thinks with the most logic. very interesting and also very hard to stay on that path. Having the ability of ""the fourth wall"" also helped in move forward, resistant to fear, charm, taunts, very powerful indeed"
24,"Oct 19, 2020",he made a good point they all killed someone to get pass the first scenario even that little kid so if you don't take care of yourself then you don't deserve to live money grabbers 
24,"Oct 19, 2020",Jesus f*cking christ the audacity of those assholes
24,"Oct 19, 2020","I can't wait to see Inho Cheon get what's coming to him üòå gonna be even more satisfying than watching little Han boy become a mother ü§∞
Edit: These aren't spoilers, this is just what I hope happens."
24,"Oct 19, 2020",[The Constellation Spiteful Spender wants the next episode now]
24,"Oct 19, 2020",Throw Myeongeh under the bus! He‚Äôs got 8000 coins now
24,"Oct 20, 2020",I love it when the main character doesnt stick to moral values. Like they're in the apocalypse and they expect people to still follow the moral code even tho most if not all of then already killed someone  
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I love love love Dokja‚Äôs character. I am incredibly sick of ‚Äúgood‚Äù characters that make stupid decisions because ‚Äúit‚Äôs the right thing to do‚Äù I‚Äôm fed up with the moral high ground. Obviously he‚Äôs not a bad guy either, he‚Äôs just selfish and I don‚Äôt find anything wrong with placing your survival first. He is NOT responsible for these people"
24,"Oct 19, 2020",Jean Henri Fabre was a French Naturalist in the late 1800s known for his books on the lives of insects if anyone‚Äôs curious.
24,"Dec 2, 2020","is it just me, or does Dokja get hotter with each passing episode. I love how he looks, I love how he doesn't take bull, look at him!!! he's one of the many reasons why my standards are skyrocketing"
24,"Oct 19, 2020","God, I'm already so spoiled with this one episode a day lol. Easily my top 3 series, can't wait for more!!!!"
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I think the important thing here is regardless of whether or not sharing coins is the moral thing, Dokja not letting himself be manipulated is better in the long run. Leaving a mob under Incite‚Äôs control will only hurt him in the end. Not to mention, giving those coins would be like taking responsibility for those lives. It‚Äôs too much for anyone to really bare. "
24,"Oct 22, 2020","people are saying that he wasn‚Äôt keeping a moral high ground or that the people were telling him to keep a moral high ground and he wouldn‚Äôt. but i think that he‚Äôs still got a moral high ground. these people, the moment they were manipulated or had to think things through, resorted to murder. and that‚Äôs exactly what he expected of them. so why give them coins? why trust them? i think that despite his looks saying ‚Äòneutral chaotic with evil‚Äô it‚Äôs more like ‚Äòlawful chaotic with a moral compass‚Äô."
24,"Oct 19, 2020",I see Dokja as a survivor not good or bad just trying to live.
24,"Nov 25, 2020",Finally this MC action makes sense in an apocalyptic world. He's not bad but smart
24,"Oct 20, 2020","I love how they try to attack him, he fights back, and their expression is *surprised Pikachu face* "
24,"Oct 19, 2020","I don‚Äôt seem to follow why people have been saying this makes them evil? They threw their own lives away, unable to beat their inner fear and even attempt to survive. It would be a waste to save someone like that. In fact, I‚Äôd say saving them just to force them into more suffering would be the evil choice. If they are unable to even try and survive for themselves, why not just let their suffering end? "
24,"Oct 19, 2020","It seems cruel on the surface, but Dokja's got a point in not being too generous. People who live passively and allow themselves to get manipulated by relying on charity and sponsorships won't survive if their supporters suddenly decide to leave them be. It's true in the Scenario, and in this reality, too"
24,"Oct 19, 2020",Dokja is not the protagonist of twsa so he will have to take hard and clever decisions in order to survive this game till the end...and it's much more fun to see him not following the moral values
24,"Oct 19, 2020","he really does look like a villain in that lase slide, its so awesome, no wonder the constellations are interested in him."
24,"Dec 2, 2020","100 coins just means you‚Äôre alive one more day to beg for even more coins. It‚Äôd be a waste. Hopefully Dokja mentions boss man‚Äôs monies.Also, I love he gave Hyunsung Lee a shield and Lee loves him now. They‚Äôre bros. Gotta max out that affinity."
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Dokja, an actually good main character."
24,"Oct 19, 2020",Seriously? As if he‚Äôs some high level monster that you can defeat and he‚Äôll just drop coins. Why don‚Äôt they just break some pottery and pray for rupees? 
24,"Dec 2, 2020","""do they deserve my help."" it's an important question. he can't be expected to shoulder the weight of all these people through the whole apocalypse. at some point they need to stand up for themselves."
24,"Dec 3, 2020",I love how the author sets Dokja apart while Inho says ‚ÄúReturn the coins to the people‚Äù it sounds like he is doing it for the good of the people and Dokja‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnd if I refuse‚Äù sounds villainess but he‚Äôs the main character and it‚Äôs refreshing that he isn‚Äôt a morally bound person but at the same time hasn‚Äôt tipped too far off that has left him insane in this situation. This is absolutely one of my favorite webtoons by far and I rarely read anything other than heartwarming and romantic webtoons.
24,"Dec 2, 2020","First, they wanted free food. Next, they were too scared to help him kill the giant rats for coins. Third, when they came back, they asked for free coins, thinking that he would give. After that, they tried to kill him and expected him to be a sitting duck. Finally, they have the audacity to be surprised that he sliced someone's arms off."
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Honestly, I love Dokja‚Äôs character! He‚Äôs rational and doesn‚Äôt let his emotions take the reins over his decisions. He‚Äôs the embodiment of someone going against the world‚Äôs corruption while not utilizing the common ‚ÄúGood prevails‚Äù trope. I‚Äôm 100% looking forward to his journey!"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",*Hyunsung Lee has started to trust you*Dokja: hmmm... I can use this...
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I agree with Dokja, there‚Äôs no reason for him to help these people, specially in the situation they‚Äôre in."
24,"Dec 2, 2020",the mc did the right decision because if they can survive just that one scenario how will they survive the next one those people is so pathetic the mc help them for food then they will blamed him for losing of coinsüòë
24,"Oct 20, 2020","I don‚Äôt need sleep, I need the next episode!"
24,"Oct 19, 2020",Yay! A gray area character!!
24,"Dec 2, 2020",People who rely on others too much usually drag down the whole group because they always expect you to save them and feed of the kindness of others. In a survival situation you have to either drag them with you and risk getting the whole squad killed or you have to leave them behind to save those who are able to stand alone. I think Dokja made the right decision because it would mean he'd have to take care of a bunch of people even in the future. That is not a longterm solution.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I feel like Dokja is more rational than evil as people are saying. He makes smart decisions and calls based on logic. everybody is talking about the moral high ground and how hes evil when mans is making rational decisions and being smart. hes neither good nor evil hes j a guy with a rational mind
24,"Nov 28, 2020","This comics unreleased episodes are starting to make me agree with ""coins are power""..."
24,"Dec 3, 2020","I love Dokja‚Äôs personality. In my opinion, he is correct. This is the apocalypse, and he isn‚Äôt obliged to help everyone. Everyone brought food because they were hungry. It‚Äôs their own decision! What does Dokja have to do with it? If they wanted coins, earn it themselves. It‚Äôs every man for themselves"
24,"Oct 21, 2020",[Constellation of anticipation has fast passed all episodes and is now anxiously awaiting the future.] 
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I love this author already. They're the first to actually show you when the veil of civilization is torn apart by apocalypse. Even after murdering another person to survive, these people are acting dependant on others. If they don't fend for themselves, no one will fight for them anymore. Beautiful storytelling."
24,"Dec 2, 2020","that's one the the reasons I really like this story, the MC is quite different from the standar hero üôà I'll support him as far as he don't betray his team üòåüëå"
24,"Oct 20, 2020",Dam I caught up to quickly again I‚Äôm so happy that‚Äôs he‚Äôs releasing quickly and with great quality I‚Äôll keep spending coins as long as they keep coming 
24,"Dec 3, 2020","people i know that there are some people who came here from the webnovel but for those of us who are reading it for thw first time on webtoon dont google anything about omnimicent reader because it will just most likely spoil the manwha for you like it did for me
edit: did anyone else love hyeonseongs face when he was holding the shield"
24,"Dec 3, 2020","This is absolutely perfect, Dokja maintains logical thinking in a time where it would be necissary to do so, so it actually makes sense, he isnt a hero, just a guy, a lucky guy but a guy nonetheless."
24,"Dec 2, 2020","None of you can say that Dokja isn't good. He doesn't do bad things, he just does what is needed to survive. Moral ground won't work in ""apocalyptic world"". He didn't use them, he just simply did what was best for him so I really like his decision"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja= BadassDokja in the end of the story= Fucking badassü•¥
24,"Jan 2, 2021",WELL THIS IS REAL INTERESTING Dokja is a unique protagonist and i absolutely love it
24,"Dec 3, 2020",[The constellation ‚ÄúLazy Procrastinator‚Äù is excited for the next chapter]
24,"Dec 3, 2020","Although, those background characters are hella annoying for being hypocrites, their reactions and actions are all natural. I mean, who did expect this to happen? Not even Dokja. Dokja is lucky enough to have knowledge about the overall situation.  Also, it's understandable as to why they're afraid to go out for the quest. I mean, their families and friends didn't come back after they joined something like that."
24,"Dec 2, 2020", True Neutral Character coming through.
24,"Dec 2, 2020","As a mother I say kill the greedy bastards and save the children, but as a lover of apocalypse stories, the kids would get him killed."
24,"Dec 5, 2020",I am now a simp for Dokja ü§ö
24,"Dec 3, 2020",they only show interest in dokja when they need something from him. why should he share his coins with them? he made the right call üò§
24,"Dec 2, 2020","You have me hooked! Dokja‚Äôs decision really gave a sense of reality to the comic. Most would make their characters be the ‚Äògood‚Äô guy, stick to morals and would give themselves to save others. Dokja is a very  rational character and I am excited to see where his story leads him. "
24,"Dec 2, 2020","y did I have the biggest smile on my face when he said ""y should I give u any"".... am I psycho"
24,"Apr 9, 2021","dokja really takes no ones shit and I think that‚Äôs what makes him such an awesome protagonist. Like yeah it‚Äôs cruel but considering the circumstances, he‚Äôs got every right to refuse. No one else has done anything that deserves his help. It‚Äôs survival of the fittest, people are bound to show their ugly sides no matter what"
24,"Apr 8, 2021","if I was one of the people there, I would be desperate and honestly feel some resentment towards Dokja, but I'd also understand that he very much risked his life to get the food and coins he has and I don't have the right to demand him to give me some, especially if I haven't even tried to risk my life to get them myself. so I understand if they feel frustrated, but it should be more with themselves and the situation. what Dokja's doing is perfectly fine and realistic."
24,"Mar 27, 2021","absolutely love this anti-hero, what a fresh twist. Looking forward to the lack of romance and high action packed chapter to follow"
24,"Feb 23, 2021","I love him, he's not evil just logical and fair"
24,"Dec 19, 2020","They're all using scrap metal, bats, tools, and pipes as weapons with some waving bone weapons as the highest thing there, and this mf pulls out a sword"
24,"Dec 18, 2020",He risked his own life to get the food. Of course he is not going to give it all out for free.
24,"Dec 17, 2020",I like a lot Dokja just because he's not pretend  to be like the hero or something like that he's just acting like the situation are and the instinct of survive. 
24,"Dec 16, 2020",The woman‚Äôs constellation has to be Ariadne right? Like with the whole thread to get out of the dungeon thing is kinda like her and the labyrinth 
24,"Dec 3, 2020",I mean why should he give them coins when they are threatening him? 
24,"Dec 3, 2020",I was wondering how they were going to portray the dokkaebi chat! I must say I am thoroughly pleased. I love the emoticons. üòÇüíú
24,"Dec 3, 2020","This webtoon is so amazing!!! The art is some of the best I've ever seen, it is so well done, I love it! The plot is awesome! I normally don't like apocalypse-themed stories, but this is amazing!!! The characters are fantastic, too (especially Dokja) I love how realistic they all are. I can tell how hard the author(s) worked on this, and they did truly some of the best work I've ever seen. 
Well done!"
24,"Dec 3, 2020",DOKJA!!! ME TOO GIVE ME JUST 5 COINS TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THE STORY!!!! AND THEN GIVE ME 5 MORE!!!! AND THEN 5 MORE!!! AND THEN 5 MORE!!!....... THEN I WILL PAY YOU BACK PLEASE!!!! I JUST WANT TO SEE MORE OF YOUR SURPRISING AND AMAZING INTELLEGENCE AND DECISIONS!!!!-   *1 second later*  *rip my arms ;;;;*
24,"Dec 3, 2020","GOD I WANNA READ MORE, WHY CANT THIS SERIES JUST BE OVER SO I CAN BINGE IT "
24,"Dec 3, 2020",I love that he's not a hero. I get tired of all the high morals and instead he's a survivor. This comic is amazing 
24,"Dec 2, 2020","What‚Äôs the old saying about Jesus, ‚ÄúGive a man a fish he will that day, teach a man how to fish he will eat every day.‚Äù  Giving them coins doesn‚Äôt solve the issue because what about the next day and day after that they‚Äôll need someone to help them rather help themselves. "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",these people complain about morality but don't hesitate to kill people for coins. at leat dokja's transparent. 
24,"Dec 4, 2020","They all knew about the survival fee, yet they still bought so much food that they didn‚Äôt have any left for the fee. Now correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but didn‚Äôt you get 200 coins for clearing the first situation? They had enough coins there alone to survive two days. But they bought large quantities of food in order to have it. Now doesn‚Äôt that sound like the Sloth and Fox sin? Gluttony and Greed? Screw them Dokja is definitely doing the right thing. "
24,"Apr 26, 2021",It's funny how those people went from pleading for Dokja's help to being completely hostile towards him. Talk about true colors huh.
24,"Mar 14, 2021","Unrelated, but I swear to god I am SCREAMING ABOUT THIS LITTLE BOY. GILYEONG I LOVE YOU SO DAMN MUCH. I don't know what it is but something about him has just stuck in my heart since the beginning. And every reaction with Dokja just makes my head SPIN. The 'big brother' vibes are killing me!"
24,"Mar 11, 2021","honestly it‚Äôs messed up that they‚Äôre all so dependent of dokja since he has the food and the coins. like damn if yall want some then stop sitting around and get some yourself. survival of the fittest and wisest am i right? if your kid doesn‚Äôt have enough coins or food, stop babying him/her and teach them to survive not to depend on others"
24,"Feb 22, 2021",Dude is a true capitalist
24,"Feb 15, 2021",Dokja is such a badass
24,"Jan 1, 2021",In an apocalypse there could have been no better choice.
24,"Dec 21, 2020",LESHGOOOOO I'm so glad he's not your typical hero he has his own sense of neutrality nd I love that 
24,"Dec 9, 2020",damn it why is he so hot
24,"Dec 8, 2020",People can hate Dokja all they wantI still think he's bae üò©‚ù§Ô∏è‚úãüèΩ
24,"Dec 8, 2020",Damn...Dokja is ‚ú®ÔΩÜÔΩâÔΩéÔΩÖ ‚ú®
24,"Dec 5, 2020","Ah, yes. This is the type of MC I like. üòå"
24,"Dec 4, 2020","Y didn‚Äôt he say that guy with the glasses have 7,000 coin just ask himüòÇ"
24,"Dec 3, 2020",He's using like a mythical max level weapon on level 1 villagers 
24,"Dec 3, 2020",I love how people were trying to guilt him using morals and then literally two seconds later tried to kill him
24,"Dec 3, 2020",omniscient reader is the best thing on this universe 
24,"Dec 3, 2020",I completely understand why he chose to do that if he wouldve chosen to give his coins out most of the people would die anyway and he would‚Äôve wasted 2000 coins for no reason leaving him with way less coins
24,"Dec 3, 2020",its funny how the same people willing to kill to survive are the same ones that ask for coins to survive like get your crazy ideas that world revolves around you under control. dokja aint at fault for the fact u domt have survival fee after all u did was sit on your asses and wait for someone else to take care of you
24,"Dec 3, 2020","I really like where this is headed. So many stories have the main character stick to the typical hero plot, which there‚Äôs nothing wrong with because it always makes a good story. But I really like how different this is. It‚Äôs a way more accurate portrayal of the chaos and the human desire to survive. People really wouldn‚Äôt be generous in this scenario. It really is a fantastic depiction of survival of the fittest."
24,"Dec 3, 2020",The reason Wednesdays exist. Omniscient Reader
24,"Dec 3, 2020",Dokja just became one of my 3 favourite MCs.
24,"Dec 3, 2020","I like this so much. I didn‚Äôt think he was going to kill someone but you got to do what you gotta do. And it‚Äôs not some game, this is actual survival. You already payed for the food so no refunds. This is a game of survival and you must think wisely "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I think everyone can agree it‚Äôs so refreshing to have a character who cares about others but also knows to look after themself first. Can‚Äôt wait to see how it develops further thank you author keep up the great work!
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Dokja‚Äôs character is what‚Äôs lacking in solo leveling. Limits. I rly, rly like Dokjams character, the whole series I believe is a gem that needs to be caressed slowly. Great job Author. Hope it continues to prosper "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I'm a caring person but I'm siding with Dokja. They don't see that they allowed this situation and are still being manipulated.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",why do i feel like dojka is going to turn into a nuetural good character?
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Can I just say that sword is real nice
24,"Dec 2, 2020","1. Dokja sold food for $10 while Inho sold his food for more.2. Why should Dokja be responsible for all these people life's if he isn't even part of the group. If Inho the leader shouldn't he be responsible for everyone.
4. People can lie about how much coins they actually have.
5. People already knew about this coin system early so shouldn't they have been responsible with their money."
24,"Dec 2, 2020",look our favorite dokkaebi is backü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
24,"Dec 2, 2020","It's not that he doesn't care at all. He just knows that he needs those coins to survive later, because he knows the relative future. It is his life over others, so obviously he has to choose himself. No one is going to pay him back later."
24,"Dec 2, 2020",HyeonSeong Lee is the type of guy that would never cheat on you. üòå
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Another thing I love about this is that his group stays by him, they understand that he doesn‚Äôt owe these people anything and he‚Äôs not a bad person for refusing to give them food and money. I‚Äôm glad that they aren‚Äôt falling for any of it"

24,"Apr 7, 2021","Gosh that kid is quite OP. Oh cool Sangah have some useful skill too. Woah so Dokja can now collect information on the target character. OMG The cute evil dokkaebi Bihyeong is back! Oh so the dokkaebi can use telepathy with Dokja, that's interesting. Lol the soldier Hyeonsyeong is happy with his shield. Bruh this annoying guy again. Yes, I'm waiting for you to make your decision too, Dokja. Deym he went full cold psycho, that's so awesome. He even cut that guys arm off clean. I'm so proud of you"
24,"Mar 31, 2021","It‚Äôs is time ladies and gentlemen, this is what I call sweet fucking satisfaction "
24,"Mar 13, 2021",everyone is like oh he doesn't have morals but that's not true his morality is just different. In an alignment chart he would be lawful neutral possibly lawful good compared to everyone else. He doesn't believe in giving away things for free the people could offer him something and he would probably agree. that doesn't make him moralless.
24,"Feb 12, 2021","Honestly, Dokja‚Äôs character development really resonates with me. If i have been put at the edge of my life‚Äôs cliff numerous times, hanging on with my teeth, I‚Äôd be sick and tired of people‚Äôs shit, too"
24,"Feb 11, 2021",Oh my‚Äî Dokja is so‚Äî jfjdhskfhdjebdjdndj üî• üî• üî• üî• 
24,"Feb 2, 2021",YES YES!!!! Dokja worked so hard for his coins and he is without any sponsor! Why should he give them just because they think he shouldn't let them die? They killed people without problem to survive the first scenario üôÑ
24,"Dec 29, 2020",WTF HE IS HERO FOR HIS FRIEND  AND VILLAIN  FOR OTHERS .I LOVE IT üò±üò±üò± I LOVE THIS TYPES OF CHARACTER

24,"Dec 8, 2020",this is one of those ones where they should make into a show
24,"Dec 8, 2020","yo i think dokja made the right decision. it‚Äôs an apocalypse and he has his own to care for. plus, how many of those people would give up their coins if they were in his situation? i‚Äôm pretty sure none of them would üòå"
24,"Dec 8, 2020",It‚Äôs literally the apocalypse. You live on by every decision you make and being nice isn‚Äôt going to keep you alive forever. Dokja did the right thing 
24,"Dec 8, 2020",I'm honestly in love with Dokja's character
24,"Dec 7, 2020",Dokja in the beginning of the webtoon:I'm not smart or handsomeDokja right now: *is the most attractive Character ever*
24,"Dec 6, 2020","i smell anti hero development, and im here for itüòä"
24,"Dec 4, 2020",Dokja has shown us he‚Äôs considerate but he‚Äôs not a pushover either 
24,"Dec 3, 2020",when this is your 6th time reading the comic and it still hasn't gotten old
24,"Dec 3, 2020","well if he would not have sold them food, they would be already dead ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
24,"Dec 3, 2020","I'm 100% with Dokja in this, why the hell he has to share his coins? just because some random dude ask you? lmao tbh I'll do the same, he doesn't have the responsibility for others lifes, only for his own survival. Dokja is one of the best MC I've seen in a while. "
24,"Dec 3, 2020","Love the Line about the killing in the first trial.Like, you're capable of premeditated murder but not to take care of yourself. You don't even have to do everything alone. You can team up. If they didn't just stay in one place, roughly 40-70% of them would be able to survive."
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Honestly, I would have behaved like that too. "
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Dokja is not ""selfish"" just because he isnt being blindly selfless, he is strategic because this world is all about survival"
24,"Dec 2, 2020","i love how hes not our typical hero and is a human. to be honest if i was in his position i probably wouldnt help them, either. its a dog eat dog world, only the fittest will survive, every man for himself."
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I like how he refuse. he earn the coins with hard work and good thinking, while those people are desperate to survive but they don‚Äôt think outside of the box like Dokia in the first scenario."
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja is Good AND Evil.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Yes. Mess them up do not. I repeat DO NOT let this sick ass bastered get away with this
24,"Dec 2, 2020","its literally not his fault, its like attack a stranger because they didnt want to help you with your problems. its your life to deal with. "
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Dokja is such a refreshing main character! I feel like most mains are usually true good or true evil, but so far I'd say he's pretty neutral. He's so interesting and unpredictable."
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Dick leader: Hey bro don't you have the most coins? Everyone: *COMMUNISM INTENSIFIES*
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Honestly I‚Äôm happy. Protagonists should focus on their own survival. It‚Äôs not realistic to expect someone to sacrifice themselves for a bunch of strangers, not to mention ones who have killed innocents to survive "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",forget morality... this is sparta
24,"Dec 2, 2020","thanks author, how is this comic not popular? you need to be appreciated author "
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Nice decision, he worked hard for those coins. Those people should‚Äôve worked for coins when they clearly had the chance, not leeching of someone else‚Äôs coins. It is also not even his fault that they don‚Äôt have coins from not using it wisely. So honestly, don‚Äôt give me that shit! üò§"

24,"Dec 5, 2020","I think Dokja is doing the right thing even if the other people think he is being selfish.  In a survival scenario, you can't depend on others to save you. the incite guy is banking on Dokja's morality forcing him to play nice, but survival is the goal, not being liked."
24,"Jun 10, 2021",Ariadne was a princess who gave someone (theseus or daedalus i think?) her magical thread for them to escape a labyrinth. Im a super greek mythology geek so my theory is Sangah's constellation might be Ariadne or something?? 
24,"Jan 2, 2021","its funny how they blame dokja for everything, like did he forces you to buy the food or what? "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja: I‚Äôll give you the coins back if you can undigest all that food you bought from me
24,"Dec 2, 2020",he HANDled that nicely
24,"Dec 2, 2020","it's funny how similar this is to real capitalism. people always seem to demonize people with money because there  are ""needy"" out there and thus try to take their money through various means. Just a connection my brain made."

24,"Oct 22, 2020",i read it in the novel but i still get irritated and upset with this scene!!! kim dokja may sound selfish but everyone else needs to be responsible for their own lives. giving them fish for today wont help them tomorrow.

But for him this is survival of the fittest and he earned those big money because of his smart thinking/strategy. He has the right to refuse as selfish and cruel as it sounds.

24,"Jan 12, 2022",Pff to be completely honest I would've been worse in dokja's situation like I don't know why I should save them. I don't mind being called the 'villain'..

24,"Dec 8, 2020",These people's hypocrisy is just so real to me if ever this apocalypse happens. The audacity to be guilt tripping someone to greed over their lives when that person's already trying to survive himself too.

24,"Dec 4, 2020",these people are the most unreliable if he helped them now then later they would probably betray him when the odds are against him dokja is seriously my number 1 character and development i agree damn well with his choices i would do the same its the apocalypse not a guy begging on the street i dont mean that rudely btw
24,"Dec 4, 2020",I love this because he just stick to surviving that‚Äôs all sure he may be doing some wrongs but also some right. He is more balance if anything 
24,"Dec 3, 2020","I dig Dokja, he's more in a grey area instead of being a goody-two-shoes. A lot of protagonist with his powers and knowledge would use them too much and create more problems for themselves. I'm glad a lot of webtoons seems to promote this kind of less predictable protagonist."
24,"Dec 3, 2020",Dokja's face expressions coupled with his black shirt was really . . . hot ;)
24,"Dec 3, 2020",Dokja is against communism 
24,"Dec 3, 2020","Dokja isn't a hero nor is he a villain, he's a survivor doing whatever it takes to live, and give the people he cares about the opportunity to survive without taking care of them."
24,"Dec 3, 2020",You know what I think he is making the right decision. Its there fault for being greedyüòí. Love the twist btwüíó.

24,"Dec 3, 2020","Dokja is the most fair of all them. It may seem a little too drastic, but giving that people coins would be like giving thousands of money to murderers (bc of the first scenario).

24,"Dec 3, 2020",Dokja...my guy...I simp for you...I just wanted you to know
24,"Dec 3, 2020",I definitely love Dokja being a real one. Giving coins to everyone doesn‚Äôt help anybody. What a masterpiece of a webtoon üò©
24,"Dec 3, 2020",the last panel was literal fire. Dokja's squad are preparing to destroy those idiots

24,"Dec 3, 2020","The constellation, Webtoon Fangirl, is very intrigued. "
24,"Dec 3, 2020",I‚Äôm curious to see how Dokja‚Äôs party thinks of this. 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Them ppl thought Dokja was pussy üòÇüòÇüòÇ. The entitlement of all of them as if he had to help them because why? To be a good person? Please. They all sat around on their asses instead of trying to fend for themselves and expect him to give out his resources he earned for free. Byeee 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",ain't his fault since he didn't force you guys to buy the food
24,"Dec 2, 2020",shit I love this webtoon! I think I'm addicted to it
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I like Dokja's thinking. All those people literally killed other people to make it this far but now act like their the victims at the hands of his mercy. If they were ready to kill other people for survival they are responsible for their own survival as well. It's also unlikely for them to survive anyway if they don't stop to rely on other people. And they literally had the choice to either try finishing the scenario or die because of lack of coins. The first might have even provided some coins.
24,"Dec 2, 2020","honestly, what are they gonna do to him if he doesn't share? In a matter of minutes they'll all be dead anyways so..."
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I love his character....  it's real....  who would want to share his live freely with someone he didn't know

24,"Dec 2, 2020",here I am the person who read the novel Patiently waiting to see kyrgios
24,"Dec 2, 2020",chaotic neutral?
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Wait until you see what he become in the future
24,"Dec 2, 2020",what I find interesting is that these people who are themselves killers trying to hold Dokja to a moral high ground. like bish??
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Yup. Inho needs to see he ain‚Äôt the boss. And the people need to see that Inho has been mooching off of them. Parents with little kids, children, women have it rough in scenarios like these :/ but even Dokja knows that he needs to cull thieving menaces to be of real help. And that dude that got violated by a demon seems to not have learned his lesson either :/"
24,"Dec 2, 2020","the point is, that all the people in this scenario are murders. They have killed someone to be in this scenario. For them to be asking for coins as if it is the moral thing to do is ridiculous. It depends on who actually deserves to be helped. "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Sangah's ability reminds me of the legend of Theseus and the minotaur.
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I'm glad the main character is basically saying, ""F*ck you. I'm tryna survive too"" Ain't no charity in these streets! This is just life, the rich people don't hand out money, we work for our coins."
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I think his point is justifiable. He straight up asked why do you deserve his coins. Prove it, get them. This is the apocalypse, being friends wouldn't help you survive for long. üòå"
24,"Dec 2, 2020","To be honest, Dokja is the type of person who is alone, but when it comes to life-threatening situations he would do anything and help anyone if it benefits him as well. The type of people Dokja is helping are the type to 'give-and-take'. They are all compatible in there small 'group' that Dokja made. They help each other out. On the other hand Inho Cheon who don't give any f***s and use other people. (I would also like to see Inho Cheon face when that man hands got cut of by Dokja!)"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Also Dokja legit is getting food and this is what they do ;---; the respect !
24,"Dec 2, 2020","He might point out that the got who killed the Monster Has 8,000 Coins and that the guy leading them Didn't seem worried so he must have plenty of coins to spare"

24,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja is looking out for his newly formed family. notice how he was telling his new kid brother not to use his ability until he tells him to? or how he lets the girl know not to tell anybody about her contract? or how he got a shield for his buddy? it seems to me he's looking out not just for himself but his friends. oh and love the back and forth with the dokabi
24,"Dec 2, 2020","LMAO, I just realized something. Coins are the most powerful thing in that world and this is the same for us. People who have enough coins can fastpass while us peasants are left to die in boredom and impatience lewl"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",The moral high ground has no meaning when the first thing you had to do to survive was take another life

24,"Apr 4, 2021","I feel like you could never stick to a moral high ground in an apocalyptic universe. People are gonna die and you want to survive, what you have to do to survive may not he the most morally good thing to do. But that's life."
24,"Mar 31, 2021",I like dokja‚Äôs way of thinking it‚Äôs not the typical ‚Äúhero‚Äù personality that he‚Äôs got but at least he thinks rationally depending on the situation they are in stan dokja üõê
24,"Dec 20, 2020",did they think they'd survive if it weren't for dokja giving them the food? what do they think is dokja to them?? their nanny? ofc he's gonna ask you to pay for shit. nothing is free in this world. nothing. 
24,"Jan 12, 2022","I really do love Dokja's character to death, he's not the usual annoyingly good guy MC and even the protagonist of the story isn't nice. They're human and it shows, I love how much this webtoon shows the flaws of us living beings. I also would do the same thing, he's smart, cunning and selfish plus he tells it how it is, like why should I give up my coins for y'all when that has nothing to do with me? He reminds me of myself and I love it"
24,"Dec 15, 2021","i think dokja is a good person. he does help people when he can, like heewon. but theres a line between nice and stupidty. he cant just sacrifice himself for everyone else. in such an insane world, it really forces your true self out of you. i like how this mc isnt just gonna blindly follow ""we must help others!! sharing is caring!~"" like many other mcs do. another example of an mc i think is similar to dokja in the above stated manner, is medea from your throne. "
24,"Nov 8, 2021",Dokja sure is one hell of an interesting character huh
24,"Oct 20, 2021","i love how realistic (kind of) dokja is, i mean his personality"
24,"Sep 5, 2021","dokja had to risk his life in many situations in order to earn that many coins, it‚Äôs his right to keep those coins to himself instead of giving it to people that sat around in a safe zone waiting for coins and food while others went out and risked their lives for coins and food. ü§∑"
24,"Sep 1, 2021","Okay but seriously. How many of them killed to survive the first round? Only thise who didnt deserve it. And honestly, survival of the fittest (and his friends). He and his crew went out and EARNED those coins. They didnt kill a single person either"
24,"Aug 19, 2021","Idk why people think the protag is evil, in the first game he saved the child when he had no reason to, and he also saved the woman from the poison when yet again he had no reason to. It just so happens that they were useful the child was not in the webtoon that he was reading and the woman was but he had no idea who she was"

24,"Jul 29, 2021",The ad I got at the end of this episode just so happened to be a Snickers ad.
24,"Jul 29, 2021","Self defence. Moral high ground: they took lives, why should he save theirs? I dunno, still pretty high morals and he attacked only when his life was in danger ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it‚Äôs not all so black and white"
24,"Jun 19, 2021",dealing with people is exhausting irl and even in apocalypse.
24,"Jun 9, 2021",Are we just gonna ignore Hyeongseong Lee being adorable after polishing his shield??
24,"May 4, 2021","right, if you need coins get them for yourself. Dokja literally fights everytime while the others just wait for food and coins. it's an apocalypse. "
24,"May 1, 2021",I dont like it morally but i do agree with him since he did earn the coins and this is life or death he cant rlly be charitable in this kind of situation 
24,"Apr 29, 2021","yep, I'm addicted :D"
24,"Apr 28, 2021",Dokja was like: nah this an apocalypse not a charity :)
24,"Apr 27, 2021",üò®üò®üò® Dokja sometimes is really scary !!
24,"Apr 27, 2021",'i want a refund' huh lol ok karen 
24,"Apr 27, 2021","""i want a refund!"" when you ask for a refund you gotta bring back what you bought, no? then give the food back- oh you can't? not his problem"
24,"Apr 27, 2021","dude there's literally a survival fee for everyday... say dojka gave away all these coins for the people ok and then what. he cant do this everyday so they're going to die anyway. like bruh he's not even being ""evil"" "

24,"Apr 8, 2021",I love me some psychological warfare
24,"Mar 27, 2021","This is survival, anything goes. If only you hadn't bought excessively then none of this would've happened. He may look like he's making heartless decisions but it's simply survival."
24,"Mar 14, 2021",Lol our favorite Doakabi is back
24,"Mar 13, 2021",I mean even if he went full on humanitarian and gave away every single scrap he still couldn‚Äôt save everyone. In rescue training they teach you never to put yourself in a position of unnecessary risk bc you‚Äôll just increase the number of people needing rescued...same idea here. Some degree of selfishness required. 
24,"Mar 13, 2021",I'm satisfied with Dokja's decision!
24,"Mar 11, 2021",morally grey characters are my weakness
24,"Mar 5, 2021","Why isn't anyone talking about Bihyeong? He was hilarious (and adorable)! That wink! And that ""totally innocent"" whistling!"

24,"Feb 12, 2021","A character with common sense and isn't an asshole, I'm hooked now. "
24,"Feb 11, 2021",DOKJA IS SO BADASS IM HERE FOR IT
24,"Feb 8, 2021","bruh the kid in the back is lookin just as evil as Dokja. He like ""mfer deserved it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
24,"Feb 8, 2021","I'm kind of happy.  a little sad that some kids will die but, these people can't seem to understand that this world now revolves in a different way.  and dokja will ride the waves."
24,"Feb 8, 2021",im glad that dokja didn't give in
24,"Feb 5, 2021",fck that dumb face inho i wannaüòíüëä him
24,"Feb 1, 2021","i love how this dude really keeps targeting dokja,he doesn't even help them out himself just using their misfortune to manipulate them :/"
24,"Jan 20, 2021",No more kind Dokja
24,"Jan 18, 2021",i like how dokja has gone from ‚Äúi am a normal person‚Äù to ‚Äúi am a Super Genius‚Äù to ‚Äúwhy should i give a shit if you live or die‚Äù over the course of ~20 chapters
24,"Jan 16, 2021",In a situation where you dont need morals to survive... i like that attitude...heh..
24,"Jan 15, 2021",he's so hot god i need a minute
24,"Jan 14, 2021",the look in his eye is crazy... AND I LOVE IT
24,"Jan 3, 2021","Checkmate, communists "
24,"Jan 1, 2021",Yes!Yes!Yes !YES!!!!!!!! KILL THEM ALLI LOVE IT WHEN THE MC TURNS EVIL
24,"Dec 31, 2020",ooo goddamn dokja is becoming a morally grey character (someone who isn‚Äôt good but not bad)
24,"Dec 29, 2020",dokja is my new religion üßé‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
24,"Dec 26, 2020","honestly I get it; why sacrifice for people who leech off of you and kill you the first chance they get. the best thing to do, while they still had plenty time, would've been to try to fulfil the scenario with the strongest leading the charge or with Inho inspiring the others but unfortunately those in charge are selfish cowards "
24,"Dec 16, 2020",I'm glad he chooses to be selfish cause for what reason he wanna give them the coins? In this time you should save yourself first before save other people. 
24,"Dec 14, 2020",Yay the little crazy creature is bk and l love Dokia face is like a crazy person laughing to himself
24,"Dec 13, 2020","This webtoon is awesome,  the main character is very progressive and hyper aware of the situation I love it. "
24,"Dec 13, 2020",hey uh Dokja got cake 
24,"Dec 9, 2020",All these people survived by murdering someone if anything they shouldn‚Äôt even talk about sharing and having morals. I think Dokja‚Äôs decisions are right. I think morally he is doing the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing to survive. 
24,"Dec 9, 2020",What about what‚Äôs his face that received 7000 coins for finishing off the demon? Couldn‚Äôt he share
24,"Dec 9, 2020","I love how Dokja thinks, fck morals, be smart "
24,"Dec 9, 2020",This is why I love anti-hero main characters 
24,"Dec 9, 2020",am I the only one who laughed when the guy looked back at his falling arms?üëÄ it was funny to me I'm not sadistic tho lol
24,"Dec 9, 2020","If this was real life than I'd probably have to think about my personal morals and the situation a bit before siding with Dokja, but since this is fiction I'm satisfied as hell with what's happening right now. Go Dokja :D"
24,"Dec 9, 2020",Ugh man I read it to fast. Now I have to waitüòÖüò¢
24,"Dec 8, 2020",Ooooooh yes I love Dokja. He's one of the best characters I've seen in Webtoon so far.
24,"Dec 8, 2020","everyones gonna forget that 8,000 coins that evil rich dude got for slaying the monster"
24,"Dec 7, 2020",would have been funny if he said that the annoying ex workmate had just won 8000 coins. just wondering what would have happened then :p 
24,"Dec 7, 2020",holy fudge!!! this is the MC that I've been looking for!!!
24,"Dec 7, 2020","this has nothing to do with the webtoon but, long live the demon king"
24,"Dec 6, 2020","He‚Äôs not rude.. he‚Äôs just being smart. All these ppl would never give him if they had..Period. They would never and we all know that.. so ya, why would he? "
24,"Dec 6, 2020",dokja is the one character who's neither too kind and good to be true neither evil and ruthless he's smart and wise it's so refreshing to see such a character and well ofc he's climbing up the 2D best list too quickly
24,"Dec 5, 2020",OMG MAKE THIS AN ANIME!!!
24,"Dec 5, 2020",AWOOOOGA BARK BARK GRRRRR
24,"Dec 5, 2020",Yesss love a good Chaotic Neutral character. 
24,"Dec 5, 2020","I wonder what the backstory of that kid did since the first scenario is to kill an organism. I wonder if he killed a person or something else. 
The kid as in one of the woman‚Äôs kid.
"
24,"Dec 4, 2020",I love it when my main characters go chaotic neutral.
24,"Dec 4, 2020",Did anyone notice Huwons traits is about to blossom hope she doesn‚Äôt become a mass murder like Dokja said she might
24,"Dec 4, 2020",please make this an anime!!!
24,"Dec 4, 2020",I like how the authors made clear Dokja its not a piece of cake by making him cut BOTH arms of the thug at once... No joking around...
24,"Dec 3, 2020",I love this. I can't even write
24,"Dec 3, 2020",He went from zero to badass in 2 seconds
24,"Dec 3, 2020","I'll call it as a realistic, smart and pratical GOOD character. "
24,"Dec 3, 2020",dokja is the epitome of true neutral 
24,"Dec 3, 2020","I'm really curious to see how his friends are going to react for him doing that. In a survival speaking it was a really good choice, if your point in that time is to survive, then morals and feelings are useless. However, in a ""human"" way of seeing this situation, no matter what you tell yourself, there is this feeling of morality that tells you ""what he did was wrong to those persons who are just trying to live and you shouldn't be with him"" so it becomes a huge psychological conflict."
24,"Dec 3, 2020",Dokja's perfect retaliation.... this is why it's one of the top webtoons
24,"Dec 3, 2020",They all asked so nicely for the coins and food before but when he's finally being a little selfish because there his coins they all just try to kill him like dude he gave away all of his food and risked his life to find more and this is what they resort to lol
24,"Dec 3, 2020",original sin? I think it refers to the 7 deadly sin. PRIDE - inho the b@st@rd LUST - the guys that tryna rape girls by luring them back in the early ep. GREED - them hovering over dokja's food and money SLOTH - them be just sittin there waiting for food WRATH - inho and the people attacking dokja ENVY - cursed dude envying dokja for its achievements GLUTTONY - idk?
24,"Dec 3, 2020",Yeah this decision seems logical to me ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
24,"Dec 3, 2020","new world , new rules , even on normal world there is no good people and evil people . There is survival your mind, own sense od justice"
24,"Dec 3, 2020",This webtoon is a war between my ‚Äúwork together to survive‚Äù mentality vs my ‚Äúgive no shits cause they don‚Äôt deserve it‚Äù mentality 
24,"Dec 3, 2020",It‚Äôs getting so fucking good
24,"Dec 3, 2020",OuR CoIns 
24,"Dec 3, 2020","What I find funny is how they all say they want a refund, but they already ate all the food-"
24,"Dec 3, 2020",Dokja really said F in the chat to the people who can't pay for it. üëÅüëÑüëÅ
24,"Dec 3, 2020","I want dojak to turn the tables ""besides. none of this fee stuff would have happened if greedie boy over there didn't stockpile food"
24,"Dec 3, 2020",love when main characters go semi dark in these situations.
24,"Dec 3, 2020",I really shouldn‚Äôt be laughing this hard üòÇ 
24,"Dec 3, 2020",dokja really is the definition of true neutral
24,"Dec 3, 2020",Dojka in the last panel left me with shivers down my spine...
24,"Dec 3, 2020","I would have turned it around. I would have said ""Okay, but only if you and your group redistribute your own coins first. Let's see your status screen and the other search party members and have you pay off as much as possible, then I can pay the remainder. That should be fair since I haven't officially joined this group yet and have been attacked twice already. Don't  delay too long of you want everyone to survive."""
24,"Dec 3, 2020","I'm eagerly waiting for the next episode. Dokja is not a hero known for his heart of gold and his bravery. He's just another player with a distinct advantage. He has intricate knowledge of the game world and he has to use that knowledge wisely. I'm sure he doesn't want people to die, but there's no point in killing himself for them, so early in the game. He might give them a chance if he deems them worthy of joining his party, but that's about it. "
24,"Dec 3, 2020","Dokja is so freaking cool because he is not one of those goody-goody ""Always do whats right and angelic and kind at your own expense!"" kind of character, but he is not just a straight up ""Kill everyone and make explosions for no reason but to cause suffering!"" kind of character either. It is so amazing and I love it."
24,"Dec 3, 2020","It was the people decision to buy the food in the first place, then they crazy cause they don‚Äôt have the coins to survive anymore. Tough luck man ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
24,"Dec 3, 2020",I think dokja is chaotic neutral
24,"Dec 3, 2020",He did the right decision. I would of done the same or just not return
24,"Dec 2, 2020",You see those Mental Gymnastics right there. First they blame Dokja for all their problems then they expect him to fix their problems AND then expect him to just sit their and let them jump him. Hilarious 
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Hahaha the fine line between morality vs justice. It may not be morally right to not help those people but they put themselves in that position, so it would be unjust to Dokja if he were to selflessly sacrifice what he had earned himself. It‚Äôs all oh so sweet!!! Gotta love Dokja my man üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº"
24,"Dec 2, 2020","It isn't morality, it's justice. What have they done to deserve the coins, it's just stupid. The next time they need to pay the fee, they won't have any coins, because there aren' t helping nor going out for supplies. Btw, black shorted hair girl is waifu UwU"
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I was getting tired of him playing along, for the love of God, IT'S THE F*CKING APOCALYPSE!!!"
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I really like this character development. Unlike other main characters, this make apocalypses more realistic "
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I hope Dokja knock some sense into those people against Inho or even themselves. They let themselves get into a position where Inho's group has power over them. It may not be the best decision for Dokja, but it may have been a wise one."
24,"Dec 2, 2020",YES FINALLY AN MC IN DEALING WITH THESE KIND OF SCENARIOS THE WAY I WANT THEM TOO!!!! No more playing the hero and saving people who don't need to be saved or will just flip on you at the drop of a dime.

24,"Dec 2, 2020",Best. Mc. Ever.
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Of course those people deserve coins but if they‚Äôre all clamoring and running up towards him violently he can‚Äôt give them to anyone since he doesn‚Äôt even have enough coins. In addition they are only thinking of themselves when doing this- trying to attack him, saying that he *needs* to give them coins, because they need them more than him, because it‚Äôs evil to do otherwise. They act out of selfishness, so why can‚Äôt Dokja act out of selfishness too? This is the apocalypse "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",i badly want an animation of this webtoon. i know it will and i cant for itü§ßü§ß
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja is right all of these people killed someone else to clear the first scenario. Now why they are asking him for help? That's not how you survive fellas. You go Dokja. As long as he is not betraying anyone he is fine
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Bihyeong in the background, looking adorable and secretly chatting with Dokja is precious. best thing ever.

24,"Dec 2, 2020",YES! That's exactly what I wanted to see! This Webtoon just climbed up the ranks of my Top 10 with a gigantic leap.
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Everyone who is saying Dokja is gonna be a bad character kind of person, I will say these are his survival tactics if he just agrees to everything other people say then whats the profit in reading TWSA. He needs to be one of the protagonist that I feel"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",it feels to me like Dokja is going to walk a weird sort of moral grey area and apply pressure on both sides to survive. I like this...
24,"Dec 2, 2020","ok but suit man has like 8k coins, someone let them know"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Why does he let blond main group leader live?.. He kills for less
24,"Dec 2, 2020",this is totally interesting survival story where moral ground is in conflict with survival of the characters
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Finally. Tbh I would of been done killed someone bro. Like fr. Idc Let me be the Villain that is full and is rich off coins. I earned my fair share. Should of read the book. Sucks to Suck. Tell on the so called ""leader"" That bastard."
24,"Dec 2, 2020","It would have been seriously idiotic if Dokja had chosen otherwise. Usually all the protagonists try to be heroic and hold on to their morals and stuff with the stupid self sacrificing personality. BUT DOKJA IS STRAIGHTFORWARD LEGENDARY!!! AND HIS FACE IN THAT PANEL ""Why should I give you any?"" WAS SO BADASS!!!!! "
24,"Dec 2, 2020","It‚Äôs nice to have heroes that act selfish once in a while. It‚Äôs quite refreshing to see the people‚Äôs faces like ‚ÄúWHAT?!? BUT WE WASTED OUR MONEY ON YOUR FOOD!!!

24,"Dec 2, 2020",ohohohohohoIT'S NOT CENSORED
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Dokja keeps showing traits of maybe why his destiny chose him to hold more power in the times of apocalypse. People deserve love, mercy and sharing to prosper together but Dokja also knows how to find the true deserving one's. "
24,"Dec 2, 2020","...When you go to attack someone, you should expect them to fight back. He has more coins than all of you for a reason."
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Now this is what a protagonist should be
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Well frick. Why does Dokja have to be so hot and cool. Help me pls. Somebody.
24,"Dec 2, 2020","You don‚Äôt need to set yourself on fire, to keep other people warm. Greedy people just take and take, there‚Äôs no end to it. One day it‚Äôs this, another it‚Äôs that. I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs not giving in. "
24,"Dec 2, 2020","It‚Äôs rare to see a main character not maintain morals. This series is so original and well written, and honestly I hope it gets its own anime."

24,"Dec 2, 2020",oh I like him more and more 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Why should dokja share his coins if they didn't even earn them. Everyone literally wants everything for free and it's pathetic.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Yess a protagonist makes a practical decision 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",He looks dead on the inside.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",he literally disarmed that guy
24,"Dec 2, 2020",This was a rather....disarming episode

24,"Dec 2, 2020",DOKJA YESSS YOU WILL NOT BE FOOLED BY THAT EVIL MAN
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Okay but why is the dokkaebi so cute?
24,"Oct 19, 2020",I see Dokja being a grey area character. not necessarily evil but not good either hes just true neutral .
24,"Oct 19, 2020",People: kill the man who survived the subway Dokja: *Deletes a mans arms* please do continue to try if you want to die
24,"Oct 19, 2020",That‚Äôs insane. He‚Äôs giving out coins in trade for hands.
24,"Oct 19, 2020",I love dokja.
24,"Oct 19, 2020",this is not a handy situation. its all out of hand and in the palm of chaos. but this story is finger licking good.
24,"Oct 19, 2020","Came to comment on how much I like having a neutral main character, but so did everyone else üòÇ"
24,"Oct 19, 2020","Oh boy, he‚Äôs not playing around anymore"
24,"Oct 19, 2020","why cant they release two chapters a day?! they got me f*Cked Up having to wait! üëÄüò°üò° also I love homegirl that asked for the sword lol  bish has no chill and i love it,  she is def gun be a bad ass character ‚úäüèΩüëäüèΩüí¢"
24,"Dec 23, 2020",that'll be me when I stop acting nice to everyone and smiling.
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Dokja is right. Why would he give his coins for them? If he gave his coins, they will just be thankful at first, but the system will collect coins and the cycle will repeat again. It's 100% waste, he don't even know or owe them. They're parasites, and you wouldn't want parasites stick on you and extract all you have until you have none."
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I‚Äôm not gonna put Dokja on a pedestal for cutting the guy‚Äôs forearms off, but I will say, this is getting pretty interesting. "
24,"Apr 6, 2022",SLAYYY DOKJA AS YOU SHOULD
24,"Feb 24, 2022",He always think logically i love his character
24,"Feb 22, 2022",I'M SO ADDICTED TO THIS WEBTOON
24,"Jan 14, 2022","what high morality and shit?? dokja collected all those coins himself, he risked his life to get the foods too. if anything it's those ""leeches"".,,,"
24,"Jan 12, 2022","That went from.. ""Please give us some of your coins~"" to ""Kill him and get his coins from him"" real quick"
24,"Jan 12, 2022",Dokja is just keeping it 100 if they wanted to live they couldve gone out and put the work in instead following a prick who just talks all the damn time dokja earned his coins he owes nothing
24,"Dec 30, 2021",Why do they want a refund? I mean they bought it and ate itüíÄ
24,"Dec 5, 2021","I mean think about it. What would happen in the long run, it's just like that saying you can give a man a fish but, you can teach how to fish and hell fish for the rest of his life. It's not exactly like that but In the future they won't have enough coins either and he can't just keep giving them coins that will get him killed."
24,"Dec 3, 2021","yk i love it when characters drop the good deeds and decide that they don't wanna deal with any of the bs. he's also got a point as well and yeah majority of the people were asses anyway who killed to survive in the first scenario but now they're all going up to dokja and beg him for coins and shit. im excited to see where this is going, and him slicing the dude's arms? man i've never been so satisfied"
24,"Oct 24, 2021",Really love Dokja so much sick and tired of Mcs who are like ‚Äúohhh yeah I‚Äôm a good guy lets share some shit‚Äù he is like NAH BITCHES NOT HAPPENING LMAO
24,"Oct 16, 2021",Dokja believes in justice so hes right to ask why. if u have bad intentions why should he help
24,"Oct 7, 2021",[the constellation of Gamer God is overly pleased with Dokja's decision. donates 700 coins.]
24,"Oct 1, 2021",he's so hot
24,"Sep 12, 2021",This is why I love dokja ü§£‚ù§Ô∏è
24,"Aug 11, 2021","If its not just me but why do I feel like dokja is not normal either?‚Ä¶ from the start where he instantly knew how to use his bookmark and hi calm demeanor while facing people deaths, its not normal. It feels like he knows something but I couldn‚Äôt explain."
24,"Aug 7, 2021","Oh yey ~ there's a difference to logic and morality. Thats why philosophers always grind their brains with ethics coz they have different values and principles. With survival as the main objective, being charitable kills even the recipients, not just the giver"
24,"Jul 28, 2021",Bihyung is back lol but he looks so cute
24,"Jul 26, 2021",Even I'm scared and pleased to his decision. It's just so good that the author makes the plot twist exciting
24,"Jul 22, 2021","dokja's decision was realistic (idk the right term for that) bcs i mean, they are all fighting for survival. being righteous and kind would actually bring them nowhere. or something like that dang i should work on my vocabulary"
24,"Jul 16, 2021",OMG IM SO IN LOVE WITH HIS ATTITUDE
24,"Jun 25, 2021",THAT LAST PANEL. CHILLS.
24,"Jun 18, 2021",mc so bad ass
24,"Jun 18, 2021",this is refreshing
24,"Jun 18, 2021",hyeongseong is a big softie
24,"Jun 3, 2021",hahah I like how his arms got chopped off. .........They are saying that he is a bad guy but all of the survivors are  bad people for what they have done so they shouldn't even say a person is bad because their is no good people
24,"May 29, 2021",Dokja lookin' hot there wtf
24,"May 26, 2021",Am I the only one who missed the dokkaebi and thinks its cute??No? Just me?? Okayüòë
24,"May 19, 2021",ok damn that was HOT
24,"May 17, 2021",He's kinda like a prantagonist.
24,"May 16, 2021",I would have just murdered anyone who tried to take the coins. no moral high ground in this universe. 
24,"May 13, 2021",screw you inho
24,"May 13, 2021",they want to get coins easier than accomplishing the scenarios
24,"May 12, 2021","The best way to describe Dokja is ""Dark Heror"" thought their methods are cruel, they always do what's justice."
24,"May 8, 2021",This is exactly what I expected him to do in the previous episode... people should learn not to blame others for their errors (Eren Like)
24,"May 6, 2021",[Late reader is reading in class]
24,"May 5, 2021","this is actually a depiction of the sad reality, people will blame you for their own misfortune. they will ask you things and if you wont give it to them, they will blame you for the things they couldn't attain bc of the loss of that 'something' when in fact, they could've made a way to get that 'something'. "
24,"May 3, 2021",Dokja is so hot grrrrr
24,"May 1, 2021","okay look if he gave them coins just for free. like he‚Äôs not getting anything in return free. he‚Äôs giving them a free pass. they will end up just sitting there with their hands outreached waiting for you to put the next thing in their palm. they have to EARN it. even now, you have to work for everything. so like they‚Äôre not just gonna be given a free pass. even the child was like ‚Äúim not gonna be useless‚Äù and got skills to help. and actually helped. that‚Äôs not a lack of morals or empathy"

24,"Mar 8, 2021",fkk....i like this Side MC
24,"Mar 6, 2021","I think dokja is doing the right thing, if you want to survive an apocalypse you don‚Äôt really try to protect everyone around you, this isn‚Äôt a game it‚Äôs life. Survival of the fittest my dudes"
24,"Mar 5, 2021","Frankly, when trying to survive, you can only look after yourself and your loved ones. In good times or bad, you can share what you can, but if I had myself to look after, I would be the same. And I'm a really giving person. You gotta be smart and Dokja is."
24,"Mar 4, 2021",So glad the MC isn‚Äôt a generic trash that tries to have a moral high ground!
24,"Feb 26, 2021",I fucking love Dokja. He's one of the best MC out there. He sees no need in having a high moral ground. It's a damn apocalypse.
24,"Feb 25, 2021",I literally love this character..... it's ok to be badüòà
24,"Feb 25, 2021",i like how both dokja and the station ppl are to blame for their situation right now. the reason they've run out of coins is bc they gave it to dokja and now everyone is pointing fingers at him. it's a kindness of dokja to even think of sharing his food to them. this webtoon is just.. amazing. cant wait to read more.

24,"Dec 6, 2020",Guys remember to like the chapter
24,"Dec 6, 2020","I'm laughing cause the regular main characters be like: ""We need to uphold the moral standpoint and SHARE"" while Dokja just be like: ""Pay up, B*TCHES~! I don't f*cking care if you die. Only me and my friends can survive for (almost) free~!"" Like oh my god~! XD... he is like an anti hero(?) or like one of those people you think are more logical than moral(some villains?) but are actually the main character(aka Dr.Stone)"

24,"Dec 5, 2020",Dokja kinda looking like a psycho at the end there.... and i kinda I like it....
24,"Dec 5, 2020",the secret is that the coins they use is the coins us readers use to buy fast passesüòâ
24,"Dec 4, 2020","DAMMMMNNNN DOKJA, YOU RULE!"
24,"Dec 4, 2020","I agree with Dokja's logic. Why should someone that killed someone else, to save themselves, get coins from him for free. What makes them so deserving of the coins. Also the food he had he'd gathered for himself and was even willing to sell it to them. They were not obligated to buy it nor was it his fault when it disappeared."
24,"Dec 4, 2020",Honestly I would do the same in this situation. Being pushed around by the Incite ability can only go as far as you let it...Dokja just killed a STRONG monster...what are these puny humans gonna do to him? LOL gtfo
24,"Dec 4, 2020","He's simply just thinking about his own future, there's nothing wrong with that, people already do it in this world (but are more corrupt about it) Damn manz tryna live dude,"
24,"Dec 4, 2020","I thought he would tell them that the glasses clown has 8,000 coins, but this might be better, since even if all of these people manage to get past this round, they're guaranteed to die on the next round anyways lol"

24,"Dec 4, 2020","You know what? This is Kim Dokja , the best mc ever. And for novel readers, did Dokja acted like this in the novel? I don't remember clearly but I think he was not that angry. "
24,"Dec 4, 2020",I really really want this to get turned into an anime
24,"Dec 4, 2020",I got where he's coming from if he gives those ppl the coins that's equivalent to giving all the clothes off your back in the dead of winter and you die and they still in trouble. It benefits for a sec but it didn't truly help. I kind of like the route his character is taking a lawfully good character would have been supremely irritating because they would continuously sacrifice themselves without thinking of the personal repercussions. Just like an avg. person he's neutral preserving.
24,"Dec 4, 2020",oh my god I'm loving this so so much and it's getting better every single episode
24,"Dec 4, 2020",Mental note: don't ask Dokja for anything or I might lose my hands
24,"Dec 4, 2020","He risked his life to get those coins, and what did y‚Äôall do? Just sit around in the station expecting someone else to do the work for you."
24,"Dec 4, 2020",Dokja has hit his point 
24,"Dec 4, 2020",I like this character... so awesome I like it
24,"Dec 4, 2020","These comments literally sound like Constellation commentary lol. But Dokja really is an interesting character because he has a lot to deal with. Pleasing the constellations, trying to stay alive, while also helping others. It‚Äôs really unfair because he has worked really hard for his coins while other people do nothing and just expect the coins to be handed to them. "
24,"Dec 4, 2020",Gosh this whole comic is amazing! 
24,"Dec 4, 2020",‚ú®King‚ú®. Periodt
24,"Dec 4, 2020",well that was hot *nosebleeds* you see nothing
24,"Dec 3, 2020","if dokja decide to side with that high moral to help those people, he will defintely get trapped in cheon inho plan. just like if you being kind to the people for one time, they will ask you another kindness. thats how human do, even in the our world. and inho want that for his own selfishness and so he can using and  controling dokja. thats why, what dokja do here is right.

24,"Dec 4, 2020","These comments literally sound like Constellation commentary lol. But Dokja really is an interesting character because he has a lot to deal with. Pleasing the constellations, trying to stay alive, while also helping others. It‚Äôs really unfair because he has worked really hard for his coins while other people do nothing and just expect the coins to be handed to them. "

24,"Dec 3, 2020","if dokja decide to side with that high moral to help those people, he will defintely get trapped in cheon inho plan. just like if you being kind to the people for one time, they will ask you another kindness. thats how human do, even in the our world. and inho want that for his own selfishness and so he can using and  controling dokja. thats why, what dokja do here is right.

24,"Dec 2, 2020",I was so interested in this webtoon that after reading the last episode I went ahead and read the webnovel lol
24,"Dec 2, 2020","why the hell he needs to share? this is apocalypse, he gained his coins slaughtering demons. he doesn't need to share it with some man only sitting in the corner safely. I would do the same with one exception; I would spare kids. "

24,"Dec 2, 2020",dont worry bro you can open your character status in like 200+ chapters :)
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I‚Äôm so glad Dokja didn‚Äôt do what other people would deem the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing. Those people are hypocrites. Especially that whats-his-face. He should die first
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Huh come on even the lil kid is using his survival skills. It's high time these people understand. Dokja way to go boy. 
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Man, I really dislike Inho Cheon. I think Dokja is doing the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing (we‚Äôll see exactly what he plans next chapter)... he didn‚Äôt take those coins from anyone, they willingly paid because they wanted the food he originally collected himself. And he brings up a good point that all these people who are alive now *most likely* killed someone in the first scenario to survive. I can‚Äôt wait to see how the characters develop, especially Huiwon! Also can‚Äôt wait to see what fate belongs to Inho!"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",who would give Out coins to Help Killers survive Like who the hell they think they are
24,"Dec 2, 2020","a lot of top comments are saying ""everyone there had to kill in the first scenario"" but like, there are clearly young children & older people present. maybe they got lucky and had a different scenario, bc i don't remember dokja or dokkaebbi saying the first quest was the same for all users, but also, even if it was the same, maybe some of them had similar solutions to dokja in that scenario? and the comments are saying it's pragmatic to let all those people die, i disagree, that's eugenics.

24,"Dec 2, 2020",i need coins too üòú to read any further..lol
24,"Dec 2, 2020",All this time I thought the dokaebbi eyes were just hollow sockets when in reality he‚Äôs got these cutesy bubble eyes üò≠

24,"Dec 2, 2020","I can't deny it, that guy was good at manipulating people at the right time. He knows when to use his powerful enchanting words. "

24,"Dec 2, 2020","Read the web novel guys, it is srsly amazing and you will not regret it. I couldn't wait for more of the webtoon so I started the novel and I have been reading it non stop for the past three days coz it's so good. I keep trying to recommend it but it feels just like when Dokja tried to recommend TWSA and no one listened to him. :') "

24,"Dec 2, 2020",At this moment they should know they f*cked up.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",They do realize they are trying to say they deserve coins and then attempt to murder their only chance at survival! Plus they don't even know killing him will give them back their coins!
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I NEED COINS TOOOOO :'<
24,"Dec 2, 2020",One word only: BADASS
24,"Dec 2, 2020",HECK YEAH. This WEBTOON is definitely in my top 5. It‚Äôs situations like these that it makes it stand out. 
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I mean, he is absolutely right, why should he share anything with those people? To get where they are they surely had to end a life "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Lol dokja has always been a chaotic neutral character. It‚Äôs honestly really refreshing.

24,"Dec 2, 2020","I think this might be what people were referring to when they said this webcomic was different than solo leveling. in that other series, the main character helps out other people (even if they're sh*tty) because he's jacked enough to do so and also doesn't believe in allowing innocent people to suffer. well, these assholes aren't exactly innocent though"

24,"Dec 2, 2020",i really wonder how the kids got past the first scenario‚Äúok billy just go beat up that lady so we can survive‚Äù
24,"Dec 2, 2020","YES! I love this character. Of course, he has tue advantage of knowing mistly everything about the current situations, but still. He's playing a neutral role, where he is only concerned about his survival, and that of his allies, as it should be in that situation. People jus twant to get free coins and free food, yet do nothing in return. The best thing that Dokja could do for them is just give them a few tips as to how to survive"
24,"Dec 2, 2020","he's such a badass, can't wait to read the next chapter :') everyone remember to like the chapter"
24,"Dec 2, 2020","The world they‚Äôre living in is a game, and damn Dokja is winning it"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",DOKJA BECAME MORE HOTTER. I LOVE HIM SM
24,"Dec 2, 2020",To be honest if I'm in Dokja's shoe.. I should have done the same.. Seriously why should I give them when I earned those coins .. and it's definitely not my fault in such situations.. I know coins will be definitely useful to me in long race.. 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Now this is a main character that really let his Intellect go first before his emotions. I really salute Dokja for thatüòé
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I love the art so much .It's so good .I guess we all should appreciate the author for the art.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Wait.... why one of the guy who wants to kill Dokja said they must kill him and get the coins ??? How even he knows that ??? What if all the volunteers had been killed by those bastards who controll the station to get money from them ??? I REALLY WANT ANSWERS FROM NEXT CHAPTER !!! NO MORE CLIFF HANGER PLEASE......
24,"Dec 2, 2020",let's go!!!! I been waiting for this moment! :D
24,"Dec 2, 2020",i love love love this

24,"Dec 2, 2020","Spare me some coins dokja, pls i need to read next episodes :'("
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I think Dokja‚Äôs alignment is selfish neutral. so not a good guy and not a villain 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Couldn't he have exposed the businessman for having 8000 coins 0_0 I thought that was the reason the author would even give him so much
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I actually like this development. Dokja isn‚Äôt NOT considered lending people coins, but he understands how necessary coins are for his own race for strength and survival. He‚Äôs not evil, but he‚Äôs not a saint either. If he lent coins to someone, he has to consider whether they‚Äôre capable of earning coins on their own, to be able to pay him back. None of these people wanted to earn coins for themselves, but they also believe that they deserve to have coins that they don‚Äôt deserve. "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",go earn your own coins. Dokja  fighting his ass off. üòè
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I'm so glad this is getting so much love. This story would never disappoint you. Keep supporting and reading. Also please remember to like the chapters. ‚ô•Ô∏è
24,"Dec 2, 2020",damn if I was in this webtoon id want to be dokjas friend cuz if not I'm kinda screwed BUT THEN WOULD I BE LIKE THOSE PEOPLE WHO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MORALS CUZ I DONT WANNA BE LIKE THAT

starve in a dragon-like monster‚Äôs stomach for 4 days without rest and nearly slay a tier 7 demon"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja has been very smart with his decisions and this Inho guy needs to grow a pair and try and take Dokja on his own like for real man it's dishonorable to sit back and let others do your work like what are you a coward? if your gonna try and command people to do something than you should show your not afraid to do it yourself if you lead your troops into a battle but just sit back and don't go with them than you don't deserve to lead them because good people might get hurt because of you.

24,"Dec 5, 2020","No he's right. They all killed someone to get to where they are HE never killed anyone and only killed an insect. He also has been taking care of at least 3 other characters and constantly helps people where he sees fit. He doesn't HAVE to help anyone and only has to help himself. It isn't his fault if they're all weak and don't make itü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èIt's an apocalypse and survival of the fittest, yes it is sad and messed up but thats the world they live in now. Either adapt or die"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja's face expressions really made me... blush... ;)
24,"Oct 19, 2020",Dokja isn't a good or evil character. He's the most sane human being in the series. he understand his situations and has thought about things rationally. all those worthless beggars deserve to die.
24,"Oct 19, 2020",*guy tries to cut dokja with a sword* Dokja: *uno reverse* no u
24,"Sep 28, 2022","YES. Being good doesn‚Äôt leave you beholden to preserving the lives of others, especially under threat of harm to yourself and against your will. THIS is a man who cannot be so easily controlled, and petty schemers have no sway over these types. Dokja is the protagonist, not the hero."
24,"Jul 3, 2022","The Constellation ""Azure Reader"" is pleased with your actions."
24,"Jun 25, 2022","OMG THE THREAD‚Ä¶LABYRINTH‚Ä¶ I LOVE THIS SO MUCH (but Theseus is a douche, Ariadne was born to slay and I stand by it)"
24,"Jun 18, 2022",i am tired of shounen protagonists we need more mc's like dokja and Denji ( from chain saw man )
24,"Apr 22, 2022","‚ÄúIf you want some coins, Mr. Han over there just got a nice 8000 recently.‚Äù would have been my response, but this works too lol"
24,"Apr 8, 2022",the last panel is chef's kiss
24,"Mar 10, 2022","i love how dokja isn't like a lot of other protags out there: he understands that rationality and morals are useless at this point. he doesn't try to 'stick to high moral ground', but he isn't completely wrong. everyone he refused to give money to is, in truth, a killer too."
24,"Mar 5, 2022",Finally a realistic MC instead of typical Shounen one.
24,"Mar 2, 2022",this is the type of protagonist I like. hell yeah 
24,"Feb 27, 2022",best mc
24,"Feb 25, 2022","I like that Dokja didn‚Äôt give in so easily. If these people want to survive, they have to work, not beg."
24,"Feb 23, 2022",YEA DOKJA SHOW THEM
24,"Feb 20, 2022",Bruh talk about a mad flex
24,"Feb 15, 2022",i love how dokja isn‚Äôt an all around good person like a lot of ppl write their MCs to be. the people in his group pull their weight and earn their coins themselves instead of becoming useless by receiving free handouts.
24,"Feb 15, 2022",I love dokja so much it's insane 
24,"Jan 31, 2022",bihyeong is adorable lol
24,"Jan 23, 2022","hhhhhhh, i don't know why but I'm smiling like psychopath right now"
24,"Jan 20, 2022",I I‚Äôm honestly ok with this Dokja knows how to play it safe and I‚Äôm glad he not going for the always got to be the good guy act.He genuinely acts as if he‚Äôs just a guy trying to survive.Who also isn‚Äôt trying to be down right evil out of enjoyment but make this decision based on wits.He did say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm no Hero‚Äù
24,"Jan 17, 2022","I got goosebumps, this is the sht I signed up for. "
24,"Jan 14, 2022","Han is such a ba***rd. Like, we knew that he was one, but the way that he just dashed over to Inho again a frame after seeing him‚Ä¶"
24,"Jan 11, 2022","Let's be honest here, is he in the wrong for doing this? You could argue if it is moral or a ""right"" thing to do but he DOSEN'T actually owe those people anything. They bought from from him, they didn't went on a food party search with him either."
24,"Jan 8, 2022",the situation now is really intense but lemme still comment about dokja giving gilyeong head pats often UWU 
24,"Jan 4, 2022",He looks like Sung Jin Woo in the White Tiger Red Gate Arc. 
24,"Dec 24, 2021",When you a hero you alway got blame at everything when you act Villain they can't do anything to you that why I like villain than hero
24,"Dec 13, 2021","Hell yeah, show them who‚Äôs boss! If they wanted coins, they should play the game or die trying heh hoff"
24,"Dec 2, 2021","It‚Äôs a game of survival, being nice is going to lead you to death in this type of games‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs the reality that most people don‚Äôt accept."
24,"Nov 19, 2021","Can't he just pin the attention he's getting to Han? Han has 8,000 coins and he only has 2,000-3,000. He can easily put the attention on Han and Han probably has enough coins to  give 100 to each people. The estimated amount of people there is about 80 and he has 8,000 coins. It'll be enough for him and the people. And isn't he part of the leadership thingy?"
24,"Nov 15, 2021",now this i like
24,"Nov 11, 2021",damn dokja is so cool ü§©ü§©ü§©
24,"Nov 11, 2021",I love his character 
24,"Nov 9, 2021",SLAYYYYY
24,"Oct 22, 2021","those fuckers really talking about how they could've survived if he gave them food for free? were you thinking like that when you guys were out murdering people~?and why should he do that? This is an apocolypse, you do anything for yourself to survive, and who da fck would waste their time and enery and even try to get themseleves killed just to get foods for others? this is a survival game here my dudes and If you want to survive that badly, don't depend on others and find the foods yourselves"
24,"Oct 7, 2021",Should he give you back your coins? Then give him back the food you ate :)
24,"Oct 7, 2021",it's not even like it's a case of him 'not taking the moral high ground'. He is in the moral right to not give them back their coins. They paid and he delivered and he even says he didn't expect the survival fee.
24,"Sep 29, 2021",BWJSBSJSBSJSJSJS KIM DOKJA YESS SLICE ME ON PIECE. I WOULD LOVE TAHTüòçüòçüòçüò´üôè

24,"Sep 19, 2021",Dojka gonna be an anti-hero i just know it
24,"Sep 18, 2021","Yeah tell em dokja tell em, pop off girll"
24,"Sep 14, 2021",Bihyeong!!! I missed you!
24,"Sep 13, 2021","i love morally grey character, characters that always take the high ground and give in all the time annoy me"
24,"Sep 11, 2021","He needs to tell them that it was by their own choice and conscience that they decided to purchase the food from him. He gave them a win-win opportunity (coins for food), but now they blame him for even providing food in the first place? You cant ask for a refund if you begged and pleaded him for food and you devoured it. It‚Äôs not his fault the other‚Äôs don‚Äôt have the independence for ANYTHING, even achieving coins. Plus the majority of them are murderers, when Dokja won‚Äôt kill unless need be."
24,"Sep 6, 2021",The meat they're holding suddenly disappeared ü§£
24,"Aug 19, 2021",man that last panel face is just so damn evil love it
24,"Aug 19, 2021","Two things. (ONE) People seem to see his decision as a ‚Äúmuch needed break from moral main characters.‚Äù The point of this move is him breaking his enemy‚Äôs base of power. They do everything with desperation because their ringleader forces that desperation. (TWO) At the current point in time, the MPreg target of the Demon Lord is actually the most rich character, and could absolutely afford to fund the survival of everyone begging. This, is an opportunity."
24,"Aug 19, 2021","everyone is saying dokja is evil, but is his not caring really evil? if you had money that someone gave you for food, and they said they needed it more, does that automatically mean you owe it to them? no. in fact, what dokja is doing is perfectly normal considering he's not the ""main character."" he's not playing the villain, he's just not getting involved either. he's the ""reader"" of the story, so he's not supposed to be the good guy. yes supposed to be a bystander. The omniscient point of view"
24,"Aug 18, 2021",He really has done a very good jobüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè we should really appreciateHe got some brains

24,"Aug 11, 2021",ShARiNG iS BOrInG
24,"Aug 10, 2021",Dokja I don't think he needs to share his coins obviously the guy is trying to make them think oh hey he owes us but the reality of it is they're living in a situation we're being good or evil is a manner of perspective for example if you leave a someone weak or companion in a situation where they put risk to your survival leaving them to some people might be seen as evil I see as a very good decision even if it's might be seen evil to others.
24,"Aug 6, 2021",Day 23 of voicing all the characters 
24,"Aug 5, 2021",Omg I love the character development of Dokja üíó

24,"Jun 4, 2021",my my dokja is so scary
24,"Jun 3, 2021",bro we humans cant even lie that the ones begging for coins would most likely be us. i mean personally i dont care about death i don't seek death but its not like i don't despises it either. i would probs just except my fate but most people wouldn't i think. of course some are skilled enough to have coins and have the intelligence to know the situation and shit

24,"May 1, 2021",These peoples are so pathetic he earn it all because of his hard work with his team and now what? they didn't even deserve any single of penny.

24,"Dec 6, 2020",I've always hated how main characters get put in these situations but I do love to see the out come when they make there decisions. I know he is playing the neutral game so I'm curious how this will play out.
24,"Dec 6, 2020",The lion the witch and the audacity of these bitches.
24,"Dec 6, 2020",the thing is the ppl trying to get him to be ‚Äúmorally correct@ are completely immorally correct themselves which is why dokja wasn‚Äôt having their shit
24,"Dec 5, 2020","That's right Dokja, don't play along with that a-hole anymore in his games."
24,"Dec 5, 2020",can i ask whats the chapter of this on the novel? ü•∫
24,"Dec 5, 2020",I love anti-hero‚Äôs 
24,"Dec 5, 2020","I honestly liked his decision, üòóüíõ"
24,"Dec 5, 2020",I told you that Dokja is quite scary!! Man I love this Webtoon!! Keep up the good work!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
24,"Dec 5, 2020","This is an apocalypse, and morality in this case is straight up bullshit. It's wrong of people to assume anyone owes them anything. I love Dokja and his decision making. And I would've been honestly disappointed if he had complied with them"
24,"Dec 4, 2020",For me dokja is a good character he‚Äôs got a point you know
24,"Dec 4, 2020",Who needs morals when you can be badass
24,"Dec 4, 2020","I mean, but he deserves the coins... He has passed through so much already, and he even had to get out of A SNAKE'S STOMACH"
24,"Dec 4, 2020",I'm SO GLAD to see a classic Anti-Hero story arc. So few know how to do it correctly.
24,"Dec 4, 2020","I think this doesn't make him a bad character. He knows how that game works from the books, and he is trying to survive. Also how you would react to manipulation, if you agreed once there is no way that would stop the problem. Been a martir is totally impractical, prioritizing other over his own sefl for nothing, why? He was not unfair, he did not stealed from them, he selled the food that he collected putting his life in danger. Teach them to fish, no just give them the fish... "
24,"Dec 4, 2020",dokja is awesome. he's very kind but don't play no shit either. he should make everyone fight for 200 coins. last 2 standing! fight!
24,"Dec 4, 2020","seriously, that guy thought he would win against a guy with 17,000 coins at this point"
24,"Dec 4, 2020",dokja is evil like demon hahaha
24,"Dec 4, 2020",Die you scum
24,"Dec 4, 2020",I'm not sure if he is a good guy but he's a good character
24,"Dec 4, 2020",He‚Äôs a fucking SAVAGE FOR THAT. Got me drooling lmao
24,"Dec 4, 2020",Damn bro I wish this was a anime solo had rn if you were an anime I would support u all. The way dude but I like the twist
24,"Dec 4, 2020","I LOVE THIS!! But that creepy smiling dude can go swan dive of a cliff for all Icare, he is controlling these people and manipulating them! Who's gonna help me"
24,"Dec 4, 2020","The way I see it, he‚Äôs doing the morally acceptable‚Äòenlightened self-interest‚Äô: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll help you if it doesn‚Äôt cost me anything‚Äù and/or ‚Äúif it could benefit me eventually‚Äù"
24,"Dec 4, 2020",It is what it is. They bought the food for survival and now they‚Äôre getting mad that they don‚Äôt have enough money for survival? They have no one to blame but themselves
24,"Dec 4, 2020",I wasn‚Äôt expecting that not gonna lie 
24,"Dec 4, 2020",Dont forget to like the chapters y'all~ (Couldnt help but notice the number of likes are decreasing with each chapter! So let's make an extra effort and support the author even more bcs this webtoon is AMAZING!)
24,"Dec 3, 2020","Omg, Dokja! So scary~‚ô°"
24,"Dec 3, 2020",I stan Dokja I mean y should he give his coins 2 those ppl who firstly have committed murder to survive n thn aren't begging or being lk grateful 2 dokja even if he gave up his coins instead they blaming him.also does anyone not shit over here I mean its a natural 2 take a dump right or don't they have d urge 2 urinate I wanna go in that world
24,"Dec 3, 2020","amazing!! Dokja is so smart, I know, I know, he read the history."
24,"Dec 3, 2020",Understandable have a great day
24,"Dec 3, 2020",RIGHT IT'S NOT HIS FAULT üò±
24,"Dec 3, 2020",I'm not even going to lie dokja when he said why should I give you any I was like that face was so sexy I'm not going to lie and then he cut his arms off I was like damn he like that
24,"Dec 3, 2020","Why does all these coins beggars whom asking for food before asking for refund?Didn't you who make agreement to pay for food to Dokja?Then if you want refund,pay it by vomitting the foodü•¥.Common sense pleaseüòå"
24,"Dec 3, 2020","I love it, every one saying ""well he's not a 'good' character"" I get it, but also, what is good? Is good giving out handouts? Do you help people by reinforcing them not to think and learn how to survive?"
24,"Dec 3, 2020","the author represented great story telling skills and tense plot with a great execution, I love the neutrality "
24,"Dec 3, 2020","Omg he‚Äôs not some fake edge lord who claims they‚Äôll leave everyone behind, but then they find some magical way to save everyone. Thank you."
24,"Dec 3, 2020",It's the way the make out Dokja to be an ugly mf in the novel but I'm having nosebleeds over here  üò≠üò≠ why's he so hot
24,"Dec 3, 2020","I am still trying to figure out what I would do in this situation. I thought maybe I would give coins to the children, but desperate people would steal from the children anyway. If he gives to a couple people, word would spread and soon everyone would be asking to save  their life. If I were him, I think I would deny that I had most coins and try to deflect it back onto the other guy so that they would think he only claimed I had the most coins to save himself (which is partially true)"
24,"Dec 3, 2020",That‚Äôs so awesome. I like the character I think the same way. I wouldn‚Äôt have given them the coins
24,"Dec 3, 2020","""Give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish..."" Honestly they had all that time while he was gone to find food and impress constellations but they sat around doing nothing until they were down to there last dollar. I wouldn't give them any coins either.  Kind of seems like they wanted to die"
24,"Dec 3, 2020",wow he really just flipped the switch there. 
24,"Dec 3, 2020",oh hot tamales üò≥
24,"Dec 3, 2020","""Why should I give you any?"" in English means ""FUCK OFF""."
24,"Dec 3, 2020",i wonder what the others' reaction will be
24,"Dec 3, 2020",Nice!  Don't give in Dokja!  Survival of the fittest!
24,"Dec 3, 2020",bruh every man for themselves üòá
24,"Dec 3, 2020","Good, he‚Äôs keeping a cool head."
24,"Dec 3, 2020",Cash Me Outside How Bout That?
24,"Dec 3, 2020",He got the eye's of a killer.... I love it. :)
24,"Dec 3, 2020",Hmmm... chaotic neutral or chaotic good. One of those two. He's being brow beat and not backing down. I know the feeling well. He sees past the BS and pulls out the root of things. Go go!!!
24,"Dec 3, 2020","die, leeches !"
24,"Dec 3, 2020",Dokja: The capybara was the largest rodent in the world before I was born.

24,"Dec 3, 2020",this episode made me cackle lmao
24,"Dec 3, 2020","""Coins are the power in this world"" Me dang it no fast past coins.. GIVE ME THE POWER"
24,"Dec 3, 2020","giving coins isn't a moral high ground if those people wanted to live they should've taken their lives in their own hands, now they're trying to steal, they could've done something and didn't. Even if the world is cruel they still have the responsibly to take their survival into their own hands. he has no moral obligation to help them, they didn't even try to help themselves."
24,"Dec 3, 2020",This is exactly what a reader is legit gonna do tho like we know what bullshit is gonna down so we don't fall for it absolutely love that accuracy
24,"Dec 3, 2020",They are just sitting there waiting for others to get the food and risk their butts to keep them alive. Dokja has all the right to refuse to help them
24,"Dec 3, 2020",[the constellation Hyper Bean smiles maliciously in satisfaction] 
24,"Dec 3, 2020","i just love violent scenes, feels more realistic"
24,"Dec 3, 2020",I have waited for the Unbroken Faith for a while!!! IT is so nice to see how the artists portrayed it in the webtoon.
24,"Dec 3, 2020",[Lazy Reader seethes at the insolence of those people.] +100 coins.
24,"Dec 3, 2020",MANS TURNED INTO A REAPER
24,"Dec 3, 2020",Humans adapt a crazy speeds when they start looking at it in terms of a game.  foes this series have a light novel

24,"Dec 3, 2020","I am honestly curious of he has an antisocial disorder like psychopathy. He lacks empathy, doesn't seem to experience fear, always extremely rational and collected no matter the situation. "
24,"Dec 3, 2020","Ah taking the villain route huh? Interesting. Also, unfortunately, probably smart."
24,"Dec 3, 2020",No No don't touch me there this it my No No Square.
24,"Dec 3, 2020",That was hot
24,"Dec 3, 2020","He's kinda like justice in a way. He's not a god, but he's kinda like one. He could just give them coins, BUT he realizes that they've killed someone, and he's questioning whether they deserve to live. He admits he's not a saint, but are Gods really saints? The people are selfish people who bought food from him because they were hungry (probably all of them could've survived w/o food, and he was the one who went in a dangerous situation to get the food) and they blame him for their situation.(1"
24,"Dec 3, 2020",hello 
24,"Dec 3, 2020",Haha kill them kill those who dont deserve to survive in the new world 
24,"Dec 3, 2020",I‚Äôm to pathetic to ask for coins because I think if I get asked I would dye. Saying if I would of servived the first one lol. (So sorry for my spelling) 
24,"Dec 3, 2020","I wonder if the Demonic Judge of Fire is going to turn against him. :/ she seems to always want him to do nice things, because whenever she's given him coins in the past, it's been when he's done something that benefits others. "
24,"Dec 3, 2020","scary dokja. I applaud his selfish purposes, because, you know, ITS THE APOCALYPSE. but i know he will try to help anyone when and if he can. if he cant then he has his reasons. love hits webtoon"
24,"Dec 3, 2020","well hes not wrong. you cant blaim him for you not gathering enough coins or being smart aboyt and tbf the other guy is the one ""inciting"" everyone else "

24,"Dec 2, 2020",Finally a character with two well placed
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I love this face~
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Kinda glad he isn't trying to be a goody two shoes, he wouldn't survive like that. I'd rather he stayed a grey character"
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Damn, that‚Äôs kinda dark. I kinda love it. Though I‚Äôm sure this‚Äôll injure his relationship with military cinnamon roll. (His thinking is smart but the crippling maybe killing was dark. Dude didn‚Äôt even hesitate.) "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Aye I like this üôÉ
24,"Dec 2, 2020",leeches.
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I love how you can tell they are all about to view him as a monster, as a villian like they all didn't kill someone to get here. like they weren't charging at him shouting ""kill him and take his coins""."
24,"Dec 2, 2020",NGL I'm a little disappointed Bihyung isn't wearing leopard print like (IIRC) the novel said he wore at the beginning
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja is a good mc someone who I can respect ‚úä 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",yes! anti-hero! I can't wait for the next chapter!
24,"Dec 2, 2020",dokja woke up and chose violent
24,"Dec 2, 2020",i really love a main character who is not a pushover. ngl. so cool
24,"Dec 2, 2020",god I love dokja
24,"Dec 2, 2020",You don‚Äôt work you don‚Äôt eat simple rule of life
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I think the first scenario existed in the first place, so that everyone will do some original sin and then nobody will be regarded as innocent, because everyone most likely killed someone to survive. "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I‚Äôm starting to see a ‚ÄúRising of the Shield Hero‚Äù arch and I‚Äôm enjoying it very much.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja knows he a bad bitch 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",omniscient reader side characters: give me coins i want to live!!!Me:GIVE ME WEBTOON COINS I WANT TO REEEEAD THIS DAMN CLIFFHANGERS
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Niceeeee! Love that webtoons!
24,"Dec 2, 2020",YESSSSSS
24,"Dec 2, 2020","coins... coins,  I just need 100 coins to continue the series!  someone please share some coins! "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",people are selfish cowards who are quick to judge others but rarely hold themselves to their high standards.
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I'm starting to see parallels with Dokja and Jin Woo from solo leveling. Both him and Dokja started off happy go lucky then as they levelled up and grew stronger, they began to grow cold to others (understandable given the conflict in the group this chapter, tough calls have to be made) and darkness began to grow, in the case of Jin Woo. Interested to see Dokja's journey from here on out. "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",damn my love for Antiheroes just increased ~
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I was hoping to get some life advice for whenever I find myself in an annoyingly similar situation, and I mean...
I did(?)"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",In terms of D&D. That some chaotic neutral shit.
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Oh boy, coming back to watch this scenes after reading the whole light novel in a month is sure thrilling.Just let me tell you guys, we are in for a long run ^^
Pdt: if you want some spoilers or to discuss anything about the plot I am happy to talk. "
24,"Dec 2, 2020","wow.............what a great  turn in the plot.........
in a world which makes you to struggle on your own the good may be kind to help others but when the world makes you to create a good world good may go crazy to make it possible "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Cool
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Technicaly that is communism.
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Yess~~ i love his decision, thats the black and white attitude for Dokja ^0^"
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I love how this story doesn't stick to any kind of known path, the author made their own and is acing it. "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",YASSSS ANTIHERO MY DUDES!!!!!
24,"Dec 2, 2020",YUP YUP YUP GO OFF KING
24,"Dec 2, 2020",if he could read himself in the story he would hate himself but respect too just like he felt for jungheyuk?? was it the one he thinks is a protagonist
24,"Dec 2, 2020",he is scarry... I like it
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Dokya is cool and badass, like always"
24,"Dec 2, 2020","he made a logical choice. also these people did likely kill another person and yet, like dokja said, can't take responsibility for themselves so why would giving them coins be what's morally right? "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",every time I read this webtoon I'm just like : omg ...omg ... OH MY GOD How Can A wbtoon be so amazing . I look forward to it every week. Thank you authorüíú
24,"Dec 2, 2020",He's pulling a kirito
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Reading your responses is like reading constellation responses to a Dokebi stream.
"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",i can see that Dokja is not going to be the saint character but he is more moral ambiguous but im sure he has a line where he wont cross so he wont lose himself in a way. What he does is to survive and he calculates the situation before making a move. That my friend is how u survive the apocolypes
24,"Dec 2, 2020",character development reading.... hes becoming a savage. DANGER DANGER EVACUATE
24,"Dec 2, 2020","next ep is gonna straight fire. seriously, his decisions thoughout orv are great"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I liiive for the neutral decisions! He‚Äôs not greedy but not super good!!! It‚Äôs really nice for a diversity in a main character.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Equal rights equal fights
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Everyone's saying he isnt a savior aboutta be real mad when they find out his name
24,"Dec 2, 2020",He basically just said look at the sky reach out and try to grab the f**** I give 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Yes yes!! Go Dokja fight that piece of shit
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Considering the fact that dokja is the only one to have read the story I feel like he is the main character of the story or perhaps replaced the original main character of the story 
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I'm standing with Dokja here. They agreed to give him coins for food he brought over and therefore that exchange is irreversible. Unless they can offer something to him, they wouldn't have the coins. Just my opinion here."
24,"Dec 2, 2020",a good twist would be to cut out the incite guys tongue but let him live. that way he'll rely on himself instead of being a dick
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I would‚Äôve done the same, he is right. Everyone is desperate to survive to the point they ended millions of life‚Äôs but now why would he do what they want? Huh? Mans got my vote. I‚Äôll be waiting for his next move. "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",may i marry dojka ? ur officially the best hero i've ever seen
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Oooooo DOKJA is SELLING FISH üòÇü§™üòú (hope u all understood what i said)
24,"Dec 2, 2020",i like this because he is helping those who are helping themselves. those who just want to do nothing because they have decided to basically go back to how society is and it doesn't work. some have seen that those who are powerful will not help anyone but themselves so they take from the others who have not adapted to the this new world. also that one guy who sticks to his coworker is just being helped because hes there and hopefully soon he wont be or his character wont be so crappy.
24,"Dec 2, 2020","It‚Äôs a world where you can‚Äôt just do things for the sake of just doing it. Even though it is chaotic, there still is order, and with order there is a reason to everything."
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Man, my heaaarrt. Yooo I'm happy as to how this scene is illustrated so far. my heart is going wild. i'm definitely thrilled. I've been reading the webnovel and I am so excited as to how it'll be shown in this webtoon"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",its nice to see a character that isnt 100% righteous
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja‚Äôs  slight character development made me happy
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Damnnn if they be patient for moment, maybe Dokja will give at least 50 or 100 coin....btw, Dokja almost like Sung Jin Woo and Sangah like Ju Hee from Solo Leveling tho cuz they are a same creator"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I mean they are his coins not yours.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",i find it so satisfying that he doesn‚Äôt care for morals it‚Äôs make the story sm better 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Me: *sees the episode cover*Me: Yay! The white puff ball if back!üòÇ
24,"Dec 2, 2020",This is actually the most realistic Webtoon I have seen so far in a Situation like this it's the best idea to not share Coins in the long run you would loose all your Coins which is also necessary for you to survive. Plus he cam take them all out in less than a Minute so in the end that wouldn't be any Problem. I agree with his Decision.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",finally a mc who is not in the high & mightly train
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Damn I love Dokja and that last panel gave me chills
24,"Dec 2, 2020",KILL THOSE SUCKAAA 
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I love it when the Mc is not afraid to take someone's life to save his own. I get that killing someone is bad but society that they knew is gone. It's a dog eat dog world out there also why should he give his coins to you ungrateful people. you expect free thing without even earning it. Why the hell should he give you refund, you paid for the food he never forced you to. smh the nerve of those characters."
24,"Dec 2, 2020",The threat has been disarmed
24,"Dec 2, 2020",When he pop up on the tv I kind of thought danganronpa
24,"Dec 2, 2020",i see many of u didnt read the novel. from my view - there's a fine line between high moral & naivety. dokja is trying to be not naive. but he is ultimately a good guy.... you'll see. 
24,"Dec 2, 2020","i wish he told the incite guy that he would match each person saved, so at most it would be 1000 coins but i doubt the leader/incite guy would be that generous, also curious to see how the pompous idiot would manage with all eyes on him instead  "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I think sangha has the powerful power I guess !!??
24,"Dec 2, 2020",AYYY THAT WAS BADASS
24,"Dec 2, 2020","OMG! he is so......He is so Dokjaüòç
"
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I feel like Dokja is gonna turn into an Enemy, like of the protagonist is actually the antagonist and you just don't know that from what the webtoon portrays it."
24,"Dec 2, 2020",call me selfish but I respect Dokja's decision üòé
24,"Dec 2, 2020",They blame him for taking their coins when they were the ones who bought food
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Insane characters are fun, but characters like Dokja are my favorite."
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I love the development. I also love his face in the last slide.

24,"Dec 2, 2020",They have the audacity to beg and borrow money to Dokja who gained them clearing scenarios and such and they are there sitting waiting for a hero to save them lmao. 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",MANNNN I LOVE MAIN CHARACTERS LIKE THIS SO MUCH -

24,"Dec 2, 2020",Thise a**holes are just stypid why didn't you find the coins for yourself wtf you got time but you guys WASTED it
24,"Dec 2, 2020",is it weird I want a sword now
24,"Dec 2, 2020",mofos better watch closely this gonna be 2021
24,"Dec 2, 2020",OMG BEST WEBTOON IVE READ SO FAR WHY CAUSE THE STORY IT MAKES BE ON THE EDGE OF YOUR STEAT ON THE CLIFF HANGERS WAITING FOR TYE NEXT EPISODE 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I like how that han guy dashed to the side with the incite skill guy
24,"Dec 2, 2020","evreyone used beg ""I WANT A REFUND CUZ IM BOUT TO DIE"" its super uneffective"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",In this game you have to survive but those people spend all the money of food. Even tho they knew that this world is unpredictable. Dokja is doing great work. He is trying his hard for survival and obviously he's a genius

24,"Dec 2, 2020","This is easily my new favorite comic! Love it so, so much!"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",while i kinda like heroes who try and take the high ground its not realistic its why i love dokja so much he isn't the goody goody hero he's the realistic guy who will do what needs to be done to survive and if that means people get saved well then good if not then oh well. Besides even if Dokja gave them all coins what about tomorrow they would be back to square 1 since nobody wants to take responsiblity and go out and earn coin themselves.
24,"Dec 2, 2020","THIS BOY, I LOVE HIM"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja is a bad bitch 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",He doesn't have to return the coins seeming as they willingly used it to buy food. Plus that guy might not have as much coins as Dokja but he could still give. 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",We stan a morally gray character that is ACTUALLY morally gray and not just really committed to the goth aesthetic.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",It‚Äôs really refreshing to see a morally grey character who‚Äôs actually morally Grey.
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I can understand his decision completely, if he gave all his cons away what would he have left as well as why should he, it's nice to see a neutral character like him"
24,"Dec 2, 2020","im obsessed with dokja being a truly chaotic neutral character. he does what's beneficial to him and him alone, and i resonate with that. sacrifices have to be made, and a moral high ground isn't safe with people like these in the world with you."
24,"Dec 2, 2020","If you want to support the author, like the chapter, and check out the official translation of the novel this is based on under the same title at Webnovel!

24,"Dec 2, 2020",You'd think people would realize that it's guys like Dokja and the ones that stick with him that survive when the world as you know ends forever. 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",A true Neutral character this will be fun
24,"Dec 2, 2020",fkk this is so satisfying
24,"Dec 2, 2020",all these people want 100 coins I simply want 5
24,"Dec 2, 2020",they are all in the same situation after the world ended but Dokja and the gang tried their best to remain good people and avoid unnecessary killing on top of trying to survive but these people choose to dirty their hands for their own survival and greed so there is no reason for him to save them who keep on making more sins
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Become a villain or become a hero? Why pick?
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Man this webtoon never ceases to amaze me. (I'm thinking of getting a job so I can read newest chapters...)

24,"Dec 2, 2020",I love characters who don‚Äôt give in to pressure and stick to what they think is right. You‚Äôre amazing Dokja ahjussi!
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I'm a person who would like people to have a good moral compass but like it's the APOCALYPSE and you can't just expect other people to help you for absolutely nothing ESPECIALLY IF YOU DONT EVEN KNOW THEM. Not saying that bc it's the apocalypse everyone can be cruel but the apocalypse situation itself is just moral haywire with the missions to kill and ALSO people are given pretty equal opportunities to get coins, so to just get the benefits of someone else's hard work is wrong"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Why is it that none of the other people in that room have a gift that can overpower that guy's incite? 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",The Constellation Pathetic Duckling is sueing you for that illegal cliffhanger
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Thank god I‚Äôm honestly getting tired of the characters that try to help and save everyone in survival comics like what‚Äôs the point? Don‚Äôt help them if they‚Äôre just gonna die in an episode your just wasting your efforts and there‚Äôs more of a risk that you‚Äôll die too
24,"Dec 2, 2020",ngl dokaj ki da scaring me rn 
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Ironic how this episode revolves around coins and here, I want to read the next chapter now but I need coins to do so üò©"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja is right! Why SHOULD he share with those greedy bastards? What did they ever do to help anyone. Dokja has the right to say no.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Oh my god we actually have a character with the balls to say no
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Haha um... Dokja you single? xD
24,"Dec 2, 2020",sigh.in order to survive why does dokja need to share when you are hostile to dokja?üòësigh.they really do not know how to adapt
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Umm guys... do we not remember that the other dude got like 8,000 coins from killing a demon achievement?"

24,"Dec 2, 2020",they payed those coins for their food which for survival. he didn't say they has to buy food. he gave them the option to buy it he didn't force them. that was their decision so they don't deserve to have his coins. 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I love this main character...
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja being the chaotic neutral we all love
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Finally those idiots learn their place

24,"Nov 24, 2020",is this a sign author that coins is all that matter? (I mean coins to get to the next episode )
24,"Nov 21, 2020",makes sense to be honest. if you help them they wont learn. at most the guy who killed the demon should give uo his coins. he become the new leader and since he has killed a demonic creature they cant argue. im also betting money are girl is gonna be something to do twith the judgement of fire constellation.

24,"Oct 31, 2020",The moral high ground is to defend yourself. It is foolishness to allow yourself to be oppressed and abused. Dokja is morally correct in his decision.

24,"Oct 19, 2020","It's at times like this where you have to question just how stupid a villian is. Now I'm not 100% sure if he does ,but  let's assume that Inho Choe knows that you can use the coins to boost your stats. At what point does it occur to him or anyone around him that by having the most coins he is also the most powerful person around and maybe he shouldn't  mess with him ( right now apparently ) Now don't get me wrong I am loving this story and the characters I just enjoy nitpicking here and there. "
24,"Oct 19, 2020",This is really fresh and different from anime and manghwa/manga that is out there. New concept and is not afraid to kill. Different your typical hero/heroine.

24,"May 18, 2021","this kind of character is refreshing. I just don't understand why he doesn't just kill Inho. especially the douche with incite skill. That would be the first human I kill. He is clean so far, but still directly the reason whatshisface that would be a successful psychopath is dead so. edit: sure killing the leader would get negative responses, but his manipulation could cause worse. (I think he waited too long) He is now making a power shift by force anyway."
24,"May 13, 2021",I really like Dokja. Him and Gilyueon are my favourite characters - they adapted surprisingly well to the apocalypse while keeping a sense of normality to them.

He can't take care of everyone THIS IS APOCALYPSE MAH DUDES! LOL And I love his reasoning when he said that those people took other's lives and then they can't handle their own after. I mean it's understandable that people can be desperate at times like this, but they can't just latch into someone everytime. If they don't have survival instincts, they wont survive ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

24,"Apr 27, 2021",he's not going to be bad. his character would become practical. no one wants to die so what he's doing ia juat for his survival. who wouldn't want to live anyway? in that kind of situation. it would be best if you'd stick to stronger allies. of course you also shouldn't be a burden. 
24,"Apr 15, 2021",high moral ground sympathy for murderers and rapists? hell nah. he should look at their attributes and skills and judge based on that
24,"Apr 15, 2021",nice to see Dokja isn't a goody two shoes
24,"Apr 11, 2021",I like how the MC isn't evil but also not extremely nice. If he had tried to follow morals and be nice to everyone he'd be dead by now
24,"Apr 10, 2021","finally, a character who don't play around with weaklings"
24,"Apr 10, 2021",Those people don't realize that if they didn't buy the food from Dokja they would've been dead by now

24,"Oct 19, 2020",I really enjoy how our MC isn‚Äôt Good it Evil but more a Neutral. It‚Äôs really refreshing especially because that‚Äôs also the kind of mentality it takes to thrive in our society.

24,"Feb 18, 2022","Oh? You want your coins back? Revive every single person you killed in the first scenario, and give me back every bit of perfect food I sold to you. ^^"
24,"Feb 12, 2022",I don't think he's decision is not really evil if think of it those people are the one who blame him from the start so in short those type of people are just 2 face they only agree with you if they get alot of benefits from it without doing something. Think about it he work so hard to reach that point while those people are just chilling there waiting for miracle to happen doing nothing and blame other for their own misery. 
24,"Feb 7, 2022",OH MY GODDD I GOT GOOSEBUMPS DOKJA MY KING HELLO HE IS SO COOL üò©üò©üò©üò©üò©üò©

24,"Jan 30, 2022",wait i just want to make sure that her god person thingy is Theseus or theaus i forgot but i remember playing a game and it was labrynthy and it said something about the string the thsues guy used to navigate the doungeoun but I'm pretty sure we're thinking ü§î right
24,"Jan 30, 2022","actually i agree with him, i would probably be the ""villain"" so to say if i was to a survival world like this, also hes not completly selfish, he did share things with his companions and gave them a very good discount too, all in all hes just trying to survive and the people in there all have killed someone to survive while he hasnt so in the end the way he does things to me is pretty justified"
24,"Jan 29, 2022",OMFG FINALLY A CHARACTER WHO DOESNT HAVE HERO SAVING SYNDROME!!!!!      (hero saving syndrome is something I created. it basically means the MC tries to save everyone even when it's clearly dangerous)

24,"Jan 28, 2022",omg dokja's new sword !

24,"Jan 27, 2022","If I was in Dokja's position I would have given them help immediately, but probably would regret it later on because people are fickle minded. They can demand for your help and forget what you did for them and turn on you later on. "
24,"Jan 26, 2022",He became that nerd into badass real quick
24,"Jan 25, 2022",he actually did the right thing 
24,"Jan 24, 2022",it's good he said no coins aren't cheap they should of worked hard to earn some they had all day. lazy people wanting handouts
24,"Jan 24, 2022",hes just like me

24,"Aug 26, 2021","Dream be like: ""Sharing is caring, and I DON'T CARE!"""
24,"Aug 26, 2021","Dokja is maintaining the high moral ground. As he said, the first scenario was the original sin. They all murdered someone to survive but have since been living on handouts failing to take responsibilities for their own lives after taking someone else's. In his eyes they aren't good people and have proven time and time again to be scummy or pathetic on top of being murders. Besides 100 coins doesn't seem that hard to make with these mood constellations ü§£ "
24,"Aug 25, 2021","hell yes. you dont owe these people anything, they have the gull to take a life, but not the balls to survive by their own accord. i think he should just drop it all on Han and let him use those 8000 coins he just got."
24,"Aug 24, 2021","I love that Dokja isn't the Golden Child and is morally gray like so happy for it. it's so much more realistic. I really like this dude, he is giving me serious life lessons atm."

24,"Aug 20, 2021","Pfft, at least Dokji and I have the same though. It‚Äôs their fault for being so dependable. They should also hunt their own foods."

24,"Jun 4, 2021",so no ones gonna talk about how the giant insect beat the stone rhino in a fight?
24,"Jun 4, 2021","ok let's be real..I mean why would he give the coins he earned..Even if he give , how long they are gonna survive,1 day,2 day ?? and to how many of them he can give??the only thing they will try to do is suck him until his coins get finished ofc becoz he looks easy among ones with high coins(inho) or they may even kill him,and then go to another, that's how it works.."
24,"Jun 2, 2021",What a badass
24,"May 26, 2021",Wonder what the constellations thought of that 
24,"May 26, 2021",Stop using your money on coins! I-I did

24,"May 1, 2021","I mean... probably all those people killed or let someone died in order to survive... yes, the good thing to do would be to share but, why should he really? I do think that moral is an important thing, and kindness is a great value to have but you can't force other people to be kind, nor righteous, specially in a world like that and especially when they'll most surely turn their backs on him once he stop been useful. I don't like many of his decisions but I understand them."
24,"Apr 30, 2021","Is it just me, or is Bihyeong looking more like the demonic child of Monokuma and Pikachu?"
24,"Apr 30, 2021","To be honest, people probably thought there wouldn't be a survival fee so they might've bought food with the rest of those coins. So, in a way, he is kind of responsible for their death."
24,"Apr 30, 2021","Yeah Bihyoeong is back! I thought they removed him bachade he made the contract, but I guess not. Nice though. He'd be really cute if he wasn't such a sadist."

24,"Jan 14, 2021",There are people like them everywhere. Manipulated by others and just live following the flow. They don't have any passion to pursue and go with the majority. Even I am like that sometimes. This just gave me a smack on my head.

I'm afraid of what will happen to his group now, so far they have all trusted him because he has helped them out to some degree but after he cut off that guys arms and isn't helping anyone then maybe they will go against him too. If they did how would that change things and How come he didn't out the other guy? Didn't he get a bunch of coins after taking the last blow of the monster Dokja beat?"

24,"Dec 10, 2020",For a moment there I thought I was reading solo leveling this WEBTOON is so good it reminds so much of solo leveling and I like how they dint copy solo leveling and made it their own thing every week I have to wait for a new chapter for solo leveling but now to wait I can read this this is probably my second favorite WEBTOON behind solo leveling 
24,"Dec 10, 2020",I LOVE THIS BOOK
24,"Dec 10, 2020","Dokja's development is impressive,  his judgment based on logic and reasoning, and him not letting anyone wear him down or manipulate him...its a leader quality üëè "
24,"Dec 10, 2020",His eyes went from innocent at the start of the series to downright badass now
24,"Dec 10, 2020",Now he pulled it out and slammed it on the table
24,"Dec 9, 2020",Dokja is a true capitalist
24,"Dec 9, 2020",Holy fricking moly I love this webtoon 
24,"Dec 9, 2020","Who else read the web novel? I'm up to ch229 now üòé (btw I'm bragging, 100%)"
24,"Dec 9, 2020","Did Sangah notice what Dokja was doing when he was trying to see her personal attribute? I'm afraid of what will happen to his group now, so far they have all trusted him because he has helped them out to some degree but after he cut off that guys arms and isn't helping anyone then maybe they will go against him too. If they did how would that change things and How come he didn't out the other guy? Didn't he get a bunch of coins after taking the last blow of the monster Dokja beat?"

24,"Dec 6, 2020",What really shocks me about this story is how no one (out of the main group) has said anything about their family members. Its so sad to be taken away from everyone you love so fast.

24,"Dec 4, 2020",Nooo!!! I neeed more
24,"Dec 4, 2020","It would be cool if Dokja ends up being the antagonist and the protagonist remains the same. He did say the regressor lost his humanity after regressing 3 times. Maybe Dokja will lose his over time. Given how strong he is, it'll be interesting to see how characters like Sangah can beat his Fourth Wall ability especially since he has no character profile on her. It is possible to beat Dokja, since Gilyeong already has an idea of what Dokja is capable of."
24,"Dec 4, 2020",if I'm remembering this correctly isn't the cost of a human life 100 coins so if he killed half of them probably the ones trying to kill him then he could save the other half
24,"Dec 4, 2020","i feel like Dokja's alignment would be neutral because he seems to fit into a morrelly grey area seeing as he isnt evil but then he also isnt good either, its really cool to see characters such as Dokja who dont stick to morals but still arnt evil "

24,"Dec 2, 2020","i hadnt thought of the first scenario like that. They all killed someone else to be here and thus nullifies any reason to even attempt for a moral high ground. Most of dokjas group killed insects and remains, for the time being, non murderers. Very interesting."
24,"Dec 2, 2020",it's easy to say this cause it's a fictional story but not everyone was gonna survive anyway. why not just get rid of the pricks and assholes like this
24,"Dec 2, 2020",The decision he take might be seem wrong but tbh if I was at his place I would do the same thing I guess
24,"Dec 2, 2020",YEAH CUT THEIR ASSES!! THAT'S MAH BOY!!
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I would have had them compete for the coins. Like top five get a loan for the survival fee and maybe I‚Äôll let them join me or fight for me later to pay it back their debt.

24,"Dec 2, 2020",okay that went from 0 to 100 real quick
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I highly doubt Dokja is gonna let the random kids die. If he does then the support of his allies goes down the gutter and most the constellations gonna hate him.

24,"Dec 2, 2020",To me dokja seems like a good guy but instead of giving handouts he‚Äôs teaching others to be responsible for their actions and in his own ways helps his friends 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Enjoy this type of Kim Dokja while you still can :)
24,"Dec 2, 2020",THIS MAN IS GOING TO THROW HANDS
24,"Dec 2, 2020",boi this world is twisted now and days so survival is the way to go not that I 100 percent agree with dokja but still..... I love the twists
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Y E S.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Where did those huge drumsticks go? ü•∫
24,"Dec 2, 2020","We get Dokja is a badass, and the other people are idiots, but is no one going to talk about Hyeonseong Lee and his sheild? It's so sparkly."
24,"Dec 2, 2020","hehe im excited to see everything illustrated. i recently picked up the novel and am on chapter 107, things haven gotten extremely interesting. i recommend giving the novel a try if you ever have spare time ^^"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",badass!!
24,"Dec 2, 2020",This is fun
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Holy shit
24,"Dec 2, 2020",scary but real f*ing cool
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Damm he's neutral 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I don't know why people mad. He can't look after others with no disregard to his own life. In my opinion people should never be blamed for doing what they need to do to survive
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I love dokja's character ain't like some typical protagonist with golden heart
24,"Dec 2, 2020",this is a prime example of a good protagonist
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Yeah bitches. stop free loading
24,"Dec 2, 2020","There's a lady with a little boy, I hope he does share some coins with them though "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",*V1G0* IS FASCINATED BY YOUR STORY AND IS WAITING FOR NEW EPISODES (he have no coins :'v)
24,"Dec 2, 2020",is it me or dokja's really hot with that sword
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Just like the people in this current chapter, I NEED COINS!!!"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Love it. Novel plot is really good and now the drawings? I dont deserve this one bit
24,"Dec 2, 2020",characters like dokja are my favorite :3
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Everyone: Its his fault!!Dokja: Lemme tell you somethin...leMME TELL YOU SOMETHIN
24,"Dec 2, 2020","remeber communism works in theory, but when put into practice it fails horribly. everyone at the shelter should know that"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",uno reversed that green shirts threat!
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Ooh~ Dokja is So Tense
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Yes boy, ask for some respect "
24,"Dec 2, 2020","if I may, her skill reminds me of hisokas bungee gumüíÄ"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Unbroken faith in action looks absolutely STUNNING.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",he is taking a very interesting route had it been me I would have also refused to disclose little to any information as well fearing that it would cost my life however im kind of concerned to his development as an individual because in the beginning he was shy and seemed nice enough now he has become nearly similar to the regressor and its quite hard to hd anything against him when any other person in his shoes wouldve done the same 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",BIHYEONG I MISSED YOU
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Great chapter! Dokja's character is super interesting. I'm very excited to see how this scenario ends.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",BUT I‚Äôm just a kidüò≠
24,"Dec 2, 2020",IF I WAS GROWN AND HAD LOTS OF MOBEY I WOULD TURN THIS INTO ANIME
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja is soo cool!!!
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I rate it ;   100000000/100
24,"Dec 2, 2020",lowkey the big ego dudes fault cause he built a community that became like that
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I know that the crowd of people are heavy hypocrites but I really can't blame them. They're just trying to survive by buying food and ""asking"" for help from people who can help them. It's just a survival instinct. And also, imagine if you were in that situation. You don't have powerful friends, maybe you're not very good, you don't have a good constellation, and you're broke. Most importantly, you're not the main character/protagonist in the story at all. So you have to live. It's just pitiful."
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I Love it.  this character us going closer to the chaotic neutral side. but sticks firmly in true neutral. this way in terms of dnd allinment checks, he could instantly alter his actions to output a spicific looking outcome. like he looks true chaotic evil then 3-4 (maybe 8 if your pushing it) episodes later he is neutral(he need to get to the alignment slowly.)  and slowly he looks like the ideal lawful good protagonist instead he is a neutral character who is on for the ride."
24,"Dec 2, 2020",cant wait for Kim Dokja whipping those bastard asses
24,"Dec 2, 2020",omg getting these updates is always one of the highlights of my study-filled week. I'm really interested to see how Dokja turns out. I love the direction it's going in right now
24,"Dec 2, 2020",yeeeeeesssss we love a morally grey character
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Judgment Time!

24,"Dec 2, 2020",LET'S GO DOKJA!!!! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!!
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Protecc bby Gilyeong. My bby Lee
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Mans speakin' the teuth, they all killed on the first round and everything they did up til then was their choice, so they can't really blame amyone but themselves"
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Dokja has a point here, while he obviously wants to help he doesn't owe these people anything. If they failed the test they failed the test, he doesn't have to sacrifice his life for the sake of somebody else."
24,"Dec 2, 2020",people: erase my foolish decisions and give me coins again so I don't suffer my own consequences! dokja: no ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüó°Ô∏èüó°Ô∏è
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Can;t he just finish the scenario and save everyone from paying?
24,"Dec 2, 2020",dokja is added to the list of dark haired mc's I simp for

24,"Dec 2, 2020",he didn't  have does kinds of morals he just didnt want to stand out but was forced to do so by a jackass with the power to manipulate the masses 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I‚Äôd kill someone for more coins to read ahead in this Webtoon üòê
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I really want this to be turned into an anime, it would be so good "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",VIVA LA REVOLUTION
24,"Dec 2, 2020",But it kinda made sense. All those people survived because they killed someone... and now that they can‚Äôt even manage to survive on their own.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",You Prick. That t man is soo pathetic i cant stand it
24,"Dec 2, 2020","you know what i like about dokja? he's not like your usual mc who wants to save everyone , who doesn't want anyone to die, who wants to be the hero. he's not really sympathetic, and he sees things as they are. e.g. these people were shit to me before, so why should i help them? do they deserve my help? he wants to do what's best for him, just like they all do, except that he's not leaching off of others, he's doing it himself. i really respect him as a character for that."
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Some of you will die, but that is a sacrifice I‚Äôm willing to make "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",He looked like a badass at the end just like a villain and I absolutely love itüíñ

I think this is very human. yes it can be unethical for certain people. but under this circumstances it's very complex. plus this has to do with the others whom decided to give his money to buy the food. I really like Dokja, I can't wait for the next chapter. "
24,"Dec 2, 2020",üò≥ Damn Dokja snapped
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I would do the same tbh. Like people this is the apocalypse you have to take care of yourselves.
24,"Dec 2, 2020","Honestly I like this, I just hate those characters that just share everything just to not be a villain I agree with the top comment"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I Like that face of him... so  tensed...
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I like how his answers don't make him a villain or naive so he doesn't have to go with the annoying brown haired dude, but he also doesn't look like a total villain"
24,"Dec 2, 2020","I think dokja will be similar to the main character in the anime ""the rising of the shield hero"" although I believe dokja would be a lot harsher in terms of what he believes is right so he can protect himself and this allies. I'm really excited on how this will turn out!!"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",All I have to say is: DAMN! 
24,"Dec 2, 2020","This mans really just said f y‚Äôall, you sinned A LOT why do you deserve mercy"

24,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja is the type of protagonist that I Stan and root for but I can‚Äôt with his power of Badass it makes me get a megaphone and hype him up
24,"Dec 2, 2020",Titano! 
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I recommend you guys read on mangaman. They have the fast passes since it released way before the webtoon did. It‚Äôs around 30 something rn

24,"Nov 26, 2020",well I actually feel sorry for the people I can understand them quite well but this guy is controling them so hardcore I mean what can you do
24,"Nov 25, 2020","Wow. Another Epic Chapter. Personally i agree with Dokja, these people just need to face the fact that they need to learn to survive on their own and Dokja isn't doing himself any good trying to be a crowd pleaser."
24,"Nov 25, 2020",Not gonna regret for spending my only 5 coins to get here;-) I'm really amazed by the decision that Dokja made. He clearly knows that he is not a 'saviour'. The coins he has are result from his efforts.Everyone should take responsibility for their own actions/decisions. If the people want coins they've should earn it themselves. Like how they manage to survived through the first scenario by their own. It is cruel but the fact is weak people r not going to survive in this kind of situation..
24,"Nov 25, 2020",I hate starting a series at the beginning of it and having to wait... especially when it gets good. 
24,"Nov 25, 2020","I like that he isnt really a hero or a villain. He thinks rationally and doesnt let underserved guilt control his decisions. I cant agree he is 100% right to do what he does though, but it all depends on the way of thinking. Putting myself in the situation ill probably break amd give what coins i have because of all the pressure but to be fair i wouldnt even be alive to reach that point if i would act like that. "
24,"Nov 25, 2020",hi
24,"Nov 25, 2020","Y‚Äôall if dokja decided to save them all then they would come crawling back to him the very next day, when the next daily fee happens . And this time they‚Äôll be expecting to survive off of him, and they‚Äôll all depend/leech off on him. I think he made the right decision "
24,"Nov 25, 2020",Lmao bihyeong is so cute I love how his character ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù (ik it‚Äôs just bc he wants money/fame but still) & he greeted them so cheerfully asking if they‚Äôre ok

24,"Oct 19, 2020",I don't know how Dokja got this way. Not caring about human life in a short period of time. There has to be a way people can earn coins in this world without depending on constellations giving it to them or completing scenarios. Some type of work like mining or something.
24,"Oct 19, 2020","Lol in the novel, those 2 women wanted the soldiers to give them coins bc they gave them ‚Äúservice‚Äù to which the soldiers denied doing. So the soldiers said that if they let them *ahem* ‚Äúput it in‚Äù then they would think about it, causing lee to get angry. It wasn‚Äôt to join the party lol.

24,"Dec 2, 2020",yuh dokja just snapped

24,"Dec 2, 2020","This is bad...how can they just say that like,They should try to prove thier worth instead of trying to kill him like, how dumb are you?He have more coins because of some reason people!!!"
24,"Dec 2, 2020",he's right though why should he give them coins. also if he did the next time the fee shows up they are going to rely on him to give them coins then it turns into a cycle which might end him with no coins.
24,"Dec 2, 2020",I like the fact that the others are still behind him obviously positioned to protect himüî•
24,"Dec 2, 2020","YESSS, USE LOGIC NOT MORALITY"

24,"Dec 2, 2020",What I think he should do is give them coins but only if they give him the survival reward. So they all live + gain respect for Dokja. And he also gets his coins back.

24,"Dec 2, 2020","I love the morality of Dokja he makes such a thrilling character to have as the narrator and lead. In so many other stories he would have just flown under the radar, popping up once or twice and being remembered by the audience but not the lead, but in this he gets the spotlight we didn‚Äôt know we even wanted "

24,"Dec 3, 2020","I greatly Approve of Dokja our MC right now. I mean he still has the moral high ground, most of those people are there because they killed someone and still refuse to be responsible for their own lives or actions. Why should he help them? It would actually be pointless since they wouldn't learn anything. Morally the right action is to let them suffer the consequences for their choices so that if they survive maybe they'll change on their own."
24,"Dec 28, 2021",I would like a psycho MC hehe am getting tired of the good and cringey ones
24,"Aug 11, 2021",im so glad dokja doesnt have the saviour complex that most mc's tend to have :D

24,"Jun 28, 2021",Tbh I would prob do the same. Being a good person is cool now but in a situation like that it‚Äôs jst being weak. It‚Äôs jst letting others manipulate u for personal gain. At that point I would sorta jst be like ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù
24,"Jun 25, 2021",YES FINALLY A CHARACTER WHOS NOT A BITCH! This is why I LOVED Solo Leveling

24,"May 7, 2021",I like the way Dojka just helps people that actually does need it and I honestly love the way he is not stick on being the good ass guy but instead a fair one literally loving it!!!!!
24,"May 6, 2021","Dokja doesnt take shit, and I love it so much. Pathetic humans....used all their coins and blame someone else for their stupidity. Trash deserves to be destroyed"
24,"May 4, 2021",ITS THE APOCALYPSE MY DUDES AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
24,"May 3, 2021",i stand by dokja
24,"May 2, 2021","he IS doing the right thing. I don't see these people doing anything to LIVE other than just *surviving*, there's a big difference. They took human life to get where they are now, 300 coins each, that's 3 more nights of life. or instead of squatting, they could, you know, work on the scenarios at hand. üôÑ ...Dokja IS taking the moral high ground."

24,"Dec 4, 2020",I give 100 coin for him
24,"Dec 4, 2020",Dokja has a point. Although he did sell them food for coins it does not mean that he should have to be forced to give them back his coins for the decision they made. Also they all have commit murder and probably more sins that no one know. Dokja earn those with his in strategies. That ending scene was fire üî• as well.
24,"Dec 3, 2020",I'm just wondering how his friends will react to this. I mean I kind of agree with him but I hope his friend don't turn on him

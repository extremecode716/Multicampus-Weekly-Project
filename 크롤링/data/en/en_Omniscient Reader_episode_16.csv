16,"Sep 23, 2020",This dude really just extorted the hell out of a mythical creature without even blinking. 
16,"Sep 23, 2020",I love the constellation 'Eyes waiting for Tuesday Night'. THEY ARE MAKING COOKIES.
16,"Sep 23, 2020","i think the constellation 'eyes waiting for tuesday night' was supposed to be us... in naver webtoon if we want to read ahead, we need to buy the episode with cookies, so maybe it's an easter egg inserted by the artist."
16,"Sep 23, 2020",'i would make a great con man since no one can see my attributes window.' 🤣
16,"Sep 23, 2020",Congratulations on surviving death! Here's some poison fog!
16,"Sep 23, 2020",Breathe it in. Can you feel it? That's the feeling of the Author reaching out for your coins.
16,"Sep 23, 2020","I have to admit, I was skeptical in the beginning of this webtoon but now I am convinced. This is one of the best I have read and it 100% needs to become an anime. Please and thank you."
16,"Sep 23, 2020",Dokja: *scams Bihyeong* Bihyeong: (ノ｀Д´)ノ彡💰
16,"Sep 23, 2020","I prefer the name ‘Broken Faith’, compared to ‘Broken Trust’ to be honest 😔 Edit: It’s already changed to ‘Broken Faith’. Thank you, translation team! You’re the best! ❤️❤️"
16,"Oct 18, 2020",Dokja's face when they're talking about the ratio is amazing.
16,"Oct 18, 2020","""I'm not the protagonist of this story"" 👁️👄👁️"
16,"Sep 23, 2020",Why the heck is there a constellation constantly baking cookies?
16,"Sep 26, 2020",I really wondered why Dokja wasn't really great at his previous Minosoft sales work. Our Dokja has a natural talent of scamming though 😼
16,"Sep 23, 2020","oh so its gonna be ""trust"" huh. I can see how it could be translated as such but it really doesnt have the same ring to it or the same kind of emotional impact as ""faith,"" Especially at that certain scene near the end.....trust just doesnt do it! the connotations arent the same!!!! please translators...consider reading the novel so that yall can realize that these names mean something!! "
16,"Sep 24, 2020","please change it to ""broken faith"" because ""broken trust"" doesn't have the same emotional impact as ""broken faith"" for certain scene near the ending of the light novel.."
16,"Sep 23, 2020","[Constellation ""Fastpass Emissary"" sponsors 200,000 coins for the next 10 years worth of updates]"
16,"Sep 23, 2020",Omnis- *click*
16,"Sep 23, 2020",To be completely honest even though this webtoon is still in its early stages im already in love with the story development so far!!! I cant wait for more and this should get an anime someday calling it now
16,"Sep 23, 2020",Sleep? what is this strange thing you speak of? what a waste of time. I only know Omniscient Reader. 
16,"Oct 18, 2020",I feel kinda bad for the sea dragon. It was just minding its own business found a snack and was killed in a pretty gruesome manner
16,"Oct 17, 2020",. I got 5 coins from reading omniscent reader and spent those on omniscent reader. THE DEDICATION. 
16,"Sep 23, 2020","This Webtoon could be adapted into an incredible anime, if it's done by the right studio."

16,"Oct 18, 2020",Another great chapter!! Though I prefer “broken faith” rather than “broken trust”

16,"Sep 23, 2020",can we get humanoid bihyung? hes too cute in dokkaebis form 😳 can imagine he's on humanoid form

16,"Oct 18, 2020","Haha, Dokja's totally giving me Khun vibes, from Tower of God. I love a story that's impossible to predict."
16,"Oct 18, 2020",oh no Dokja's hot
16,"Oct 18, 2020","I just realized how poor looking Bihyung the dokkaebi looks. He's wearing all these shaggy, roughed up clothes/cloth. And (if u read further into the story) u see all the higher up dokkaebis in better clothing. Course Bihyung will get better clothing too. Never really thought about how the clothing for dokkaebis represented their status until now, not even when reading the novel. "
16,"Oct 18, 2020",Four days!!! Four days without sleep hanging on the wall!!! He is a survival monster!

16,"Oct 18, 2020","I'm not surprised if later in this series, the dokkaebi is broke because of him."
16,"Oct 19, 2020","The Tuesday Night whatever whatever constellation was baking cookies. In Naver webtoon, cookies is the equivalent of coins here. There is a cookie oven there where you bake free cookies by doing missions. That is called cookie baking. So the constellation was baking cookies to skip the ads~"
16,"Oct 18, 2020","...and that, kids, is why you read! You never know what information will be useful in the future. "
16,"Oct 18, 2020",guys what if the constellation 'secretive plotter' is actually the author xd

I know he was granted the ability by the mysterious author but still"
16,"Apr 26, 2021",on the south korean webtoon they use cookies as currency instead of coins and the webtoon comes out every tuesday that what that constellation is basically saying its a 4th wall joke

16,"Jan 27, 2021",I just can't hate dokkaebi..he's too cute..
16,"Oct 18, 2020",isn't it so funny how when the Dekkebi (forgot how to spell it) talks to the MC he talks to him like he's his boss?
16,"Oct 18, 2020",is NO ONE gonna talk about how suggestive that one panel looked. yall KNOW what im talking about. theres no way a whole creative team of adults looked at that panel and not a single one saw what it looked like lmaooo

16,"Oct 18, 2020",Why are we using strange vocabulary? ‘Nucleus’ instead of ‘core’ and ‘broken trust’ instead of broken faith? Nucleus doesn’t cause issue (though I don’t know why it needed changing) but trust is a bit strange... it’s just weird.
16,"Jul 14, 2021",Help I can’t stop reading this shit I’m supposed to be sleeping rn
16,"Apr 27, 2021","honestly, at first I was going to quickly skim through this to get the coins (I do that a lot.....🥲) but after reading the prologue and every episode after.

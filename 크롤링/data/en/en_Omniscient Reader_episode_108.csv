108,"Jun 8, 2022",YEAH F YOU PAUL
108,"Jun 8, 2022","Paul about to be hit with sweet, sweet, karma by his own legal system."
108,"Jun 8, 2022",His crimes are Appaulling 
108,"Jun 8, 2022","I know this moment is serious, but the fact that the mid-level dokaebi's name is Paul just kills me ü§£ü§£ü§£"
108,"Jun 8, 2022",HIS NAME WAS PAUL?!?! ALL THIS THAT HAPPENED THE LAST FEW CHAPTERS HAPPENED CUZ OF A MF NAMED PAUL???
108,"Jun 8, 2022","You get what you deserve, Paul!..... wait, Paul? Really?"
108,"Jun 8, 2022","Yuseung Shin: ""So that's his name. Paul. Finally, a worthy opponent! OUR BATTLE WILL BE LEGENDA- oh hey, Paul'icemen?"""
108,"Jun 8, 2022","This is just tragic. Imagine getting to hear someone's true wishes..the voice they lay deep in their hearts, not letting others hear it. As Shin Yoosung slowly dissapears from this world, she talks about how happy she is, how the world could be a better place, and how she can finally die in peace. 
But this contradicts her feelings about how much it hurts and how much she doesn't want to die. And Dokja must hear all of them, her sorrows, her pain, and her true feelings."
108,"Jun 8, 2022",DOKJA'S FACIAL EXPRESSIONS THIS WHOLE CHAPTER MAKES ME WANT TO CRY I CAN'T..BUT THIS KIND OF ANGST IS NOTHING COMPARED TO FUTURE ARCS. IT'S OVERKILL

108,"Jun 8, 2022",[Many incarnate have unlocked the achievement‚ÄùEMOTIONAL DAMAGE‚Äù][Sessions of therapy will be gifted due to the achievement]
108,"Jun 8, 2022","Yuseung and Junghyeok understood each other feelings without words, üò≠üò≠üò≠ they both know the pain of living many years and many other things... "
108,"Jun 8, 2022","I'm really sad about her, but the moment Paul was chained I was laughing loud enough to bother my neighbors. Karma has come, and she is GORGEOUS. "
108,"Jun 10, 2022","I was rereading this, and I realized that in the beginning, the author said that it was because of Dokja's reading that the author won the contest. If that means what I think it means, Dokja could be the whole reason this apocalypse even started. However, if he hadn't read the story, maybe another author would've won and caused a different apocalypse with a different reader having the knowledge. "
108,"Jun 8, 2022",The discord mods are here yall
108,"Jun 8, 2022",bruh most of the dokkebi have names like ‚Äúbiyeong‚Äù and ‚Äúdogak‚Äù and then there‚Äôs ‚ÄúPaul‚Äù :/
108,"Jun 8, 2022",Her smile at the end when she was looking at her younger self and thinking of how she envied her... was really really painful... Totally cried.....The artist did a wonderful job depicting her emotions üëèüëè
108,"Jun 8, 2022",The fact that they understood each other even without words spoken. üò≠
108,"Jun 8, 2022",you ever feel happy watching somebody get brought away by the cops? because Paul here can go rot in a cell for thinking he was above THE LAW
108,"Jun 8, 2022","...is that translation correct? It feels like YJH should be thinking ""I will AVENGE you"" or ""I will take revenge FOR you""... the way he says it, ""I will take revenge ON you"" implies that he's gonna punish her for dying!"
108,"Jun 8, 2022",You're telling me this mf that I've hated this whole time is named Paul
108,"Jun 8, 2022",FUUCK YES. Also...Paul? Really? I'm glad he's being punished after one of the best girls was killed because of him. I can't WAIT to watch him burnüò§üò§
108,"Jun 8, 2022","Pfft! Wait, his name was Paul? That‚Äôs such an ordinary name for an antagonist like that üòÇ"
108,"Jun 8, 2022","So, I think and rather hope that Paul is getting punished because they technically cleared the scenario when they convinced the catastrophe to help them. This is because they simply had to defeat them in any sense and they weren't rewarded for it and he doubled up the condition making them do it again in a way he wanted.
I could 100% be wrong there could be some background stuff like him trying to not give full rewards or something, but he seems genuinely confused so I'm betting on the prior."
108,"Jun 8, 2022",DOKKEBI ENFORCERS!? OMG YES! I love that they were introduced like Darth Vader in a darkened Hallway. So terrifyingly awesome!
108,"Jun 8, 2022",Who else cried?
108,"Jun 8, 2022","this whole episode was so heartbreaking, the wordless exchange between jungyeok and yuseung and the scene between the young yuseung and the dying catastrophe "
108,"Jun 8, 2022",Perfect - now just hold him still while Yuseung kicks Paul‚Äôs a**
108,"Jun 8, 2022","[Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" wishes that the webtoon explains why Hell fire worked with one stab like in the novel.]"
108,"Jul 13, 2022","ugh the translation.. yjh actually said ""i will avenge you"" instead of ""get my revenge on you"" and catastrophe yuseung said ""a lovely child// i'm envious"" instead of ""pretty// i'm jealous"" when looking at her younger self, which i think is more impactful"
108,"Jun 8, 2022",imagine being some random person named Paul and everyone in the comments are just screaming at you... couldn't be me... üò´
108,"Jun 8, 2022",Paul: the consequences of my own actions? impossible!
108,"Jun 19, 2022","What Dokja could see from Omnisciemt Reader's Viewpoint Level 2 is what we readers always do as 'reading between the lines'. There is no explicit dialogue, just the description of a scene when mo one says anything, but WE comprehend and make our own version of whatever goes on. the fact that dokja who read the story for 10 years got to finally see such a thing makes me so emotional on his behalf"
108,"Jun 9, 2022","You know, the scenerio did say ""Defeat the catastrophe"" it never said ""kill the catastrophe"". There are other ways of defeating opponents besides killing. I wonder if this has to do with Paul's arrest..."

108,"Jun 8, 2022","i just want you manhwa only's to know... he is going to get his just desserts. don't worry. i won't spoil, but you won't be unsatisfied"
108,"Jul 13, 2022","Ah sh*t, his name's Paul? My name's Paul. Goddamn it."
108,"Jun 8, 2022","Why is Yuseung becoming my unironic favorite character so far. She's just so loyal, and her character fits and stays consistent after the centuries long time jump. I think it's just good writing that hasn't really stayed with most of the characters throughout their ""screen time""."
108,"Jun 8, 2022",Fr thought of Paul Baylord when I heard his name was Paul
108,"Jul 13, 2022","ok i just want to point out how Jeonghook is a leader through and through, the last few of his thoughts are totally different than what he appears to be at first, a cold ruthless selfish mc, but instead he cares for his comrades ""take rest"" ""you have done well"" it must be so painful for him in last regressions watching everyone die one by one and no one to understand him, the weight of past memories and what to come next, the despair that comes with it.. damn it's hard not to talk about novel üò≠"

108,"Jul 13, 2022","Oh, another interesting plot twists. This novel is right now for me best on Webtoon (since Tower of God started with war and messed up). 
Btw, i tried to read original novel this one is based on and for me story (and maybe characters, idk i didnt go too far) was its only positive. But its here now and with great art, so the story can be shown well, characters look finally exciting enough and the bad or boring passages are way faster to get through. So for me, win win sutuation. Good work."

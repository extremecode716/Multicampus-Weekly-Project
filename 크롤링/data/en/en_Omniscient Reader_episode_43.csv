Episode,Date,Review
43,"Feb 24, 2021",dokja just kinda exposed his self they all gonna be suspicious of him now
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Oh I really hope this tag team turns up to be the baddest duo since Khun and Bam
43,"Feb 24, 2021","I think there is Big Misstranslating here in Jonghyuk stigma it was ""Transmission lv 1"" not ""Reincarnation"" ... Yjh doesn't have reincarnation stigma (srry for my bad english)
note : They fix it! Thankyou translator-nim üôè"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Thanks for spoiling the entire plot Dokja. Appreciate it.
43,"Feb 24, 2021","THEY DID IT! They dropped the main image where they're sword v sword and he asks Dokja ""Who the heck are you?!""""AGHH IT'S ABOUT TO GET REALLL"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",[Achievement unlocked: Prolouge complete] 
43,"Feb 24, 2021",So...how many walls did he break?
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Dokja sounds like the best fan boy.
43,"Feb 24, 2021","The Joonghyuk angst & Dokja angst begins ü•∫ This moment was so intense when I 1st read this in the novel so I wasn't expecting KDJ's face to look like that when he turned to look at YJH in disbelief after he heard him think he was alone üòÇ. Anyways, I am not ready for the upcoming rollercoaster of emotions this story puts you thru in the future. (The translation was a bit iffy in this episode. I don't remember ""aliens"" & YJH shouldn't have the reincarnation stigma) EDIT: Spoilers in the replies"
43,"Feb 24, 2021","junghyeok: WHO ARE YOUdokja :  lol i‚Äôm just all knowing, sunfish"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Did we do it? DID WE REACH THE PROLOGUE!?!?
43,"Feb 24, 2021",I am... a READER
43,"Feb 24, 2021","as novel reader to see part how much TWSA and jonghyuk as the protagonist mean to dokja. when he awlays get bullied, when he didn't have any luck in his life. dokja read and watch jonghyuk struggle, to see how jonghyuk didn't give up to survive, give dokja power to keep survive in his lowlest life before. and it make me broke, my chest hurt and almost move on tears. it's tell us that even trivial things is so precious and have a lot of meaning to certain someone"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Am I the only one who thinks this is one of the most powerful episodes yet? The art and story is just...amazing üëè
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Dokja used spoilers. It was super effective
43,"Feb 24, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" complains about the censorship and wanted a refund from star stream.] [The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" has been waiting for the episode to load.] [5 coins have been sponsored.]"
43,"Feb 24, 2021","Dokja sounds like me when I facebook stalk Someone and their whole family. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never spoke to you, but I know all your struggles and I support you!‚Äù"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Can Junghyeok Yu activate his Cooking lvl 10 skill plz? üç≤üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥ 
43,"Apr 14, 2021","WAIT JUNGHYUK HAD A CHILD?! A FUCKING CHILD?! NO WONDER HE'S FUCKED UP IN THE HEAD WHO COULD HANDLE THE PAIN OF LOSING A CHILD, SISTER, AND LOVED ONE AND THEN REPEAT IT???"
43,"Feb 24, 2021","and so it comes full circle? pretty sure this was the beginning of the first episode Edit: The end of this was exactly in the beginning. Now, let the show BEGIN üòÇüòÇ"
43,"Feb 24, 2021","God, Omniscient Reader is *chefs kiss* exquisite!"
43,"Mar 16, 2021","In webnovel Dokja says ""Alone? What did i come here for if you're alone?"" and it's one of my favorite Kim Dokja and Yoo Jonghyuk moments. I'm disappointed they didn't add that conversation i was looking forward to read it :("
43,"Mar 5, 2021",Pleaseeee change the word Aliens to Outer Gods!!! 
43,"Feb 24, 2021","Oh boy, let's see what Dokja comes up with this time. He knows you're not an oracle bro, and that's beyond what an oracle could know anyway. ""yeah Junghyuk I'm actually a regressing stalker"" or something"
43,"Mar 10, 2021","Lmao, the aliens are supposed to be outer gods, and the blue star weapon aura is actually supposed to be breaking the sky Swordmanship "
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Those poor sunfish.
43,"Feb 24, 2021",First novel then webtoon next please make this in to an anime anyway I love how they haven‚Äôt missed anything from the novel except for those translation error which I hope will be fixed soon 
43,"Apr 14, 2021"," AGH DOKJA'S GAY SPEECH IS FINALLY HERE I LOVE IT!! But on a serious note, Dokja's reaction to seeing Joonghyuk's regression depression honestly hurts because you realize how emotional this is for him. Joonghyuk surviving through the apocalypse is what kept Dokja surviving for all these years so the fact that he sees the character he has read abt for 10+ years questioning if he even wants to continue to live- pain"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",WE MADE IT TO THE PART FROM THE INTO!!!!!! WOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOO
43,"Feb 24, 2021","I feel like it might cause some confusion in the future calling Junghyuk‚Äôs stigma ‚ÄúReincarnation‚Äù since [SPOILER] actual reincarnators appear later in the story 
Edit: Oh hey, they revised it! Thank you translator person, keep on rocking on!"
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Dokja really captured what it means to go on a journey with your books. Its more than just reading. you feel like you're part of the story right alongside the characters. nicely written
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Okay but... his highest skill is cooking. If that ain‚Äôt husband material idk what is.
43,"Apr 14, 2021",The FEELS. Dokja being fed up with junghyuk‚Äôs depression is relatable üòÇ. Dokja saying ‚Äú i too kept reading so that i could survive ‚Äú damn dokja i want to cry üò≠ this captured the relation between a reader and the characters real well ‚òπÔ∏è 
43,"Mar 16, 2021","i am once again rereading this chapter.......i just can't get over the 'conversation' they had..... PAIN!!! THEYVE BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH PAIN AND SUFFERING AND AGONY, !!!! kim dokja found solace in reading wos even though the world turned its back on him and yoo joonghyuk is stuck on a neverending cycle of torture, each death, each turn was a reminder of his failures. ..., ....‚Ä¶ i hate it here. all of them needs a hug"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","so, is nobody going to comment about his level 10 cooking?"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","oh I forgot to mention this when I commented earlier on why Dokja's speech was so emotional but the suffering Joonghyuk had to go through also makes this chapter very emotional. Regression is a very painful process for him, seeing everyone he cares for die over and over again, and even though it's currently the 3rd turn (which is painful enough) imagine how many regressions he went through in a story with 3,149 chapters. And he's doing it all by himself. Although now he won't be alone :)"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",The Omniscient Reader!!!!!
43,"Apr 14, 2021","give up dokja, you'll never win against lvl 10 cooking üòî"
43,"Apr 7, 2021",Oml he had a child with a person?? I wanna meet the girl who could steal that ruthless man‚Äôs heart!!
43,"Feb 24, 2021",I‚Äôve been waiting for that final panel since Chapter 1. FINALLY!
43,"Apr 14, 2021",when you hate spoilers but the MC himself spoil the story üëÅüëÑüëÅ
43,"Mar 3, 2021","i am pretty sure it's supposed to be ""OUTER GODS"" not aliens... pls return it to outer gods. It's also better than just aliens."
43,"Apr 14, 2021","Novel spoilers*********
The fact that at different points in time they were each others reason to stay alive always gets me "
43,"Apr 14, 2021","I like seeing this vulnerable side of JH. He‚Äôs not cold because he wants to be, the man is traumatized and hurt from all the regressions and death of his peers he‚Äôs been through. I love how Dokja is lowkey his ride or die even tho they clash. Reading Jh‚Äôs struggle helped him get through his own. They‚Äôre like best friends but don‚Äôt know it yet"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","junghyeok: ""i'm all alone"" | dokja: *offended noises*"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","I'm not liking this ""official translation"" at all. Where's Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship...Returnees etc...  I feel the translation of this chapter lost some of the weight of this scene tbh."
43,"Mar 3, 2021",There is a translation error. Aliens are supposed to be outer gods. I hope they fix it.
43,"Apr 14, 2021","we were just so busy being amazed by his vast knowledge and memory that we forgot dokja himself is a human who has gone through a lot worse making him find solace in a webtoon novel like many of us, an escape from reality, idk why but this fact hits hard above all"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","welp you just either made a new ship, screwed yourself or gave the cinema master a new interesting play toy"
43,"Mar 23, 2021","I'm not hating here, but why the translation is so bad? so many mistakes, will it hurt to look through the novel for some parts? Well, the reaction of most of the ppl about this chapter is a little disappointing  almost no one commenting about Yu's past and his pain, or about Dokja's pain."
43,"Apr 14, 2021","KIM DOKJAAAAüò≠üò≠üò≠ didn't realize this until further on in the novel, but this part right here just cuts. So. Deep. For a reader to have been that invested in a character, in Yoo Jonghyuk. I can't say this enough, but seeing the art makes me feel so happy that I can now put a face to the characters' intense interaction. Yoo Jonghyuk, you dumb sunfish üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ "
43,"Feb 24, 2021",oh shit he exposed himself 
43,"Apr 14, 2021",lmfao cant wait for the gay baby joke
43,"Apr 14, 2021","""why is it that my eyes are tearing up?"" THEN DRAW HIM CRYING YOU COWARDS"
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Everyone say thank you to Gilyeong for the sunfish information 
43,"Apr 14, 2021","""Cooking Lv. 10"" damn he be a master chef. can't win against that"
43,"Feb 28, 2021","junghyeok: ""WHO ARE YOU? HOW DO YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ME??"" dokja: ""BECAUSE---Because I'm your stan..."" *dramatic music plays*"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Every page of this comic is GOLD üëèüèª
43,"Apr 16, 2021",who took an hour reading one chapter because one's still admiring the art?  just me?  okay
43,"Apr 14, 2021",joonghyuk really said ‚Äúyes i do the cooking yes i do the cleaning‚Äù with that cooking stat üò©
43,"Feb 25, 2021",now we are upto 7% of the original novel
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Dokja Kim: The biggest spoiler of all time 
43,"Apr 7, 2021","I bought this chapter accidentally, I did not remember that I had coins, but I do not regret anything "
43,"Feb 24, 2021","I keep watch webtoon have mistranslation or mistake in the translation, even in the previous chapter there's also mistranslation especially in skill, atribute and stigma. I just hope maybe webtoon can check the novel translation to get better translation. and please add the honorific"
43,"Apr 15, 2021",when you a badass but your mentality unstable
43,"Apr 15, 2021","I dont understand why this webtoon is losing readers after each chapter;, like??? it just keeps on getting better what is wrong with u people"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","Guys i know a lot of us read the light novel, but lets just enjoy the art and relive our memories and stop giving spoilers ok? The webtoon readers deserve to enjoy the plot and characters the way we did.. like the webtoon readers will write comments which are rhetorical questions, where ppl who do not know the story discuss their own theories. If we just straight away tell them what will happen, we'll be ruining it for them!!"
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Imagine fighting some guy and he starts rambling about your past
43,"Apr 14, 2021","""WHO ARE YOU?"" ...your biggest fan ü§ï"
43,"Apr 15, 2021",Okay now kiss.
43,"Apr 15, 2021","Right now I‚Äôm in one of the hardest stages in my life and it feels like reading has kept me sane and alive, I can relate"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","I'm actually tearing up a bit because of all the spoilers Dokja has said. I feel like he doesn't actually hate him that much. I feel like, he actually loves Joonghyuk's character but hated him after things got real. lol Idk. "
43,"Apr 14, 2021","OMG AAAAAAAAAAA THIS IS SO PAINFUL TO READ IT HURTS IT HURTSüò≠üò≠ KIM DOKJA SURVIVED THANKS OF WOS/TWSA HE LIVED JUST TO WITNESS THE END OF THE NOVEL HE STRUGGLED BUT HE'S ALIVE AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO YOO JOONGHYUK, YJH SAVED HIMüò≠ AND NOW KDJ'S RETURNING THE FAVOR"
43,"Apr 22, 2021",Joonghyuk: I'm all alone  Dokja: You dense mf
43,"Apr 14, 2021",I love how he has cooking Lv. 10 on top of all those other things
43,"May 14, 2021",did joonghyuk just get his life spoiled 
43,"Apr 15, 2021",why is no one commenting about junghyeok's level 10 cooking skills ‚òπÔ∏è
43,"Apr 14, 2021","‚ÄúI was with you the whole time!!! I‚Äôm your ultimate fanboy, don‚Äôt you know that?!‚Äù "
43,"Apr 14, 2021","Wahhh Prophets when are you coming?? (I am waiting for the SSSSS-grade character, for those who understand me) And I can‚Äôt stop loving Dokja‚Äôs character. He is so smart and fearless and thinks of himself as all-knowing LOL, but he knows his weakness, which makes him a great character. He would also do anything he can to save his companions (I respect him)"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",AAAAAAAAAAA WAS HE LISTENING? OH MY GOD!! WHAT'LL HAPPEN IF EVERYTHING COMES TO LIGHT??
43,"May 12, 2021","this chapter really shows that no matter the disses, jonghyuk is really dokja's favourite character. The fact that he's pretty much one of the, if not most significant, reasons dokja kept surviving all this time is, it's really not something that's easily describable. He's rooting for the man and to see his fav character break down like that must've hurt"
43,"Apr 21, 2021","Dokja sounded really hurt when Jungheok said he was alone. Dokja was with him all along (as a reader) they suffered and survived together, in a way..."
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Wait wait wait HOLD UP!!! YJH had a CHILD?!?! And it died?!?! This is the first time they are telling us this thing right? BACKSTORY PLEASE?!?!
43,"Apr 14, 2021","don't be suspicious, don't be suspicious"
43,"Feb 26, 2021","Funfact: The sunfish is a reference from a game where you should keep the sunfish from dying and also, it grows stronger than its past life. Its basically Yu Junghyeok Lol *The game called 'Surprise mola mola' or something*"
43,"Jul 6, 2021",don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS don't be SUSPICIOUS 
43,"May 16, 2021","Donkja: OH, How I know that..uhm..yeah we don't talk about that."
43,"Apr 15, 2021","I love how Jonghyuk's highest stat is Cooking, at lvl. 10 üòÇ ü•∞"
43,"Apr 15, 2021","While everyone's talking about the amazing ending, does anyone think that the Cinema Master looks like a deranged Walt Disney? No? just me? ok I'll leave."
43,"Apr 14, 2021",did he just call him a damn sunfish
43,"Apr 14, 2021","""I too, kept reading so that I could survive."" if this isn't me this pandemic and my relationship with line webtoon lol"
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Guess his second regression was a slice of life cooking manwha with that cooking skill
43,"Apr 14, 2021","Dokja: ""I'm... your biggest fan."" *pulls out posters and merch of Junghyeok*"
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Respect for the author for explaining the meme before using it (and for making this amazing comic but also for that)
43,"Mar 13, 2021","We did it!!! We finally reached the prologue panel!Not gonna lie, I was tearing up while Dokja was talking and flashes of his past reading the story. I totally understand that feeling o being alone and only relying on a story to completion to keep me going every day."
43,"Apr 14, 2021","Junghyeok has been through so much, man... not gonna lie, I teared up a bit"
43,"Apr 14, 2021","Dokja bro, don‚Äôt you think you went a lil overboard with the spoiling üòÇ"
43,"Sep 16, 2021",HE HAD A CHILD???
43,"Apr 20, 2021",So uh... I literally just started reading this a few hours ago.... and here I am.... now waiting for the next episode like a fiend... holy cow I didnt expect to get this deeply engrossed into the story... 10/10 have subscribed and need more...

43,"Apr 15, 2021","Gotta admit, cinema dude has good taste when it comes to battle scenes."
43,"Apr 14, 2021","LOVE THIS CHAPTER. KDJ's reactions when he was reading YJH's mind and when KDJ was shouting things that happened in the novel while the panel shows his own struggles is just,,, PAIN."
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Cooking level ten I died
43,"Apr 14, 2021","I really love this scene, since it shows that Dokja's relationship with TWSA and it characters is much more than just the only reader of a bad novel. "
43,"Apr 14, 2021",HE HAD A LOVER?!?!?!
43,"Apr 14, 2021","dokja: ""I'm a reader"""
43,"Apr 14, 2021","does that mean even as a regressor, junghyeok never met dokja? that's why he's so confused/suspicious of him? üò≥ hoo that is interesting!"
43,"Apr 14, 2021",Everyone after Dokja‚Äôs monologue: Uh... who are you???
43,"Mar 27, 2021",I didn‚Äôt know Jungheok yu was so powerful... I mean look at his cooking skill! It level 10! Most men probably ar at level 2 or 1 smh
43,"Mar 16, 2021",btw when will he wear his white coat
43,"Mar 13, 2021","Dokja had the Opportunity to hit Junghyeok two times a day, I bet he enjoyed every single bit of it ;)"

43,"Apr 15, 2021","dunno about others but for me, reading novels is whats keot me going for quite a bit of time nowas pathetic as that may be, reading about this characters is a relief for me 
so thank the translators and authors out there, you did a really good job"
43,"Apr 15, 2021",Amazing chapter! This confrontation was very emotional. I love characters having shared struggles. And the ‚Äúsnap out of it‚Äù trope is something very dear to me. And I just love people being each other‚Äôs ‚Äúsaviors‚Äù. (Bonus points for that promo pic finally happening and for the sunfish thing being explained!)
43,"Apr 14, 2021",For other characters Dokja may start looking like constellation who watched Joonghyuk's previous attempts ü§î
43,"Apr 14, 2021",My favourite personal skill he has is his lvl 10 cooking.
43,"Apr 14, 2021",I‚Äôm more worried about the constellations finding out than the people
43,"Jun 21, 2021",YOOO I‚Äôm actually crying this was such a good episode 
43,"Jun 11, 2021","that's so heartbreaking...imagine repeating things over and over again, existing alone is already sucks damn"
43,"Jun 4, 2021","this episode makes me emotional. as a reader, I too, read to escape the cruel reality we all are living in"
43,"May 14, 2021","Dokja's face when Junghyeuk is doing his emo angsty ""I'm all alone"" thing is priceless"
43,"Apr 15, 2021",dokja just spoiled the entirety of twsa without a warning :/ rude

43,"Apr 14, 2021","Oh wow, the final panel when both Dokja and Jungyeok clashed swords was the one they put on the promotional banner for this webtoon. Amazing piece of art there, thank you author-artist."
43,"Apr 14, 2021",So how many constellations are going to catch on that he knows a little too much?

43,"May 12, 2021",lmao this is so much funnier after reading chapter 46-
43,"Apr 17, 2021","Just want to mention that the webtoon is accurately going chapter by chapter so far, and if we go at the same pace we will have around 500 chapters left to go. Good luck to the artists, the story just keeps getting better!"
43,"Apr 16, 2021","this fighting scene is on üî• ""I GOT HIM it was more like I grazed him"" üòÇ"
43,"Apr 16, 2021",I swear every time i catch up on a comic i always end at the biggest cliffhanger....
43,"Apr 15, 2021","By Aliens they mean 'Outer Gods'. Lame translation on various terminologies including many of the names of those skills. Those skill names all sound pretty cool in Korean but many of them got translated to something very stupid sounding names with very unrelated meaning to the original names. Hard to understand why if there's already a finished, translated novel that has pretty descent translated terminologies with very related meaning to the original names."
43,"Apr 15, 2021",Dokja be like spitting out spoilers here and there üòÜüòÜüòÜ

43,"Mar 5, 2021",I want an omake where the constellations are all up in the comments sharing their fan theories on Dokja and Junghyeok‚Äôs mysterious connection  jejejeje

43,"Sep 25, 2021",I had to reread this chapter. This was powerful. They really did the novel justice with this chapter. Especially the last panel. 
43,"Aug 10, 2021",Poor Jonghyuk he went through all that.  AND HE WAS A DAD?!
43,"Jun 9, 2021",A‚Äùthank you for waking me up‚Äù would be nice

43,"Apr 29, 2021",why do I feel like the author actually made the story for him?? idk just a gut coz they are way too similar 
43,"Apr 19, 2021",Joonghyuk has a kid......just a reminder ü§öüòÉ
43,"Apr 17, 2021","this chapter tearing my heart out, read the webnovel and be like Dokja."
43,"Apr 16, 2021",lmao look at dokja's face when yjh said that he's all aloneüòÇ that was a look of pure betrayal similar to when your best friend asks when your birthday isüòÇ
43,"Apr 16, 2021",this chapter gave me goose bumps all the way through 
43,"Apr 15, 2021","LMAO the pannel after ""I'm alone ""üò≠üòÇ"
43,"Apr 15, 2021",...Cooking lvl10... Nani????

43,"Apr 28, 2021","I think that ""Aliens"" should be changed to Outer Gods. ORV is partly based on (spoiler) Lovecraftian myths, like Azathoth or Cthulhu, which are outer gods. Translating it as Aliens is confusing. When you google Cthulhu, you can see it is described as an outer god, NOT alien. This further proves that WEBTOON didn't bother to hire an editor who actually reads the novel (at least to the epilogue), otherwise this kind of mistakes wouldn't have been made at all üòîEdit: They fixed it!

43,"Apr 14, 2021",Oh snap.  Did he just expose himself to his friends?
43,"Apr 10, 2021","that's the first time Dokja exposed himself so much, so the constellations will suspicious of him and perhaps the guys will be afraid of him too."
43,"Apr 7, 2021",You Sunfish
43,"Apr 7, 2021","This is too epic, I love it"
43,"Apr 2, 2021",Man all those spoilers of twsa! Lol 
43,"Apr 1, 2021",man that was intense üòÉüëç
43,"Mar 22, 2021","Ahhh I‚Äôm so happy to see this finally illustrated, one of my favorite chapters"
43,"Mar 4, 2021","üßê cooking level 10, was he a chef before all this or what"
43,"Feb 27, 2021",the constellations after hearing Dokja‚Äôs monologue: wat
43,"Feb 26, 2021",This is the moment Dokja knew... he f***ed up.
43,"Feb 26, 2021",btw ominiscient reader really did get personal now hm ü•≤
43,"Feb 25, 2021","it took 41 episodes, but now we're back at the beginning"
43,"Feb 24, 2021",ITS THE SCENE FROM THE FIRST CHAPTER!!! ITS ALL COMING TOGETHER!!!
43,"Feb 24, 2021",I...am you‚Äôre greatest fan!
43,"Feb 24, 2021","AND THE SUNFISH LIVES.....Oh dear, here we go. Yjh has always been a mysterious character to me. the webtoon does flesh him out a lot. "
43,"Feb 24, 2021",Imagine someone know you peed yourself in highschool but you didnt say anything to anyone. And this guy saying this in front of his crew.
43,"Feb 24, 2021",also aint the skill is transmission? cuz reincarnation have different meaning in the series cuz yjh was not reincarnated in the first place...
43,"Feb 24, 2021",your bestest fwend that's who 
43,"Nov 23, 2021",that's kinda gay dokja
43,"Jul 26, 2021","i can't spoil, but i will say that among all of the fictional works i've ever consumed, how orv's protagonist and deuteragonist (kdj and yjh) were written in relation to each other is probably the best i've ever seen. also probably the most painful. this episode reminded me of that."
43,"May 19, 2021","This is some heavy stuff man, stuff that I too went through. Hope they can also live the life they can be in."
43,"Apr 17, 2021",I'm sorry but that was so...... romantic for me idk why
43,"Feb 24, 2021","and there it is, the scene from the first panel or so on chapter 1 üòÅ absolutely badass "
43,"Feb 24, 2021","Good chapter but there are some bad mistranslations. Junghyeok should have ""Regression"" and ""Transmission"" not ""Reincarnation"". There is a pretty important distinction between the two that shows up later on. "
43,"Feb 24, 2021",bro can I get the actual series it sounds amazing lol
43,"Sep 11, 2022",not dokja reciting the whole plot of twsa lol
43,"Sep 9, 2022",Now kiss
43,"Aug 22, 2022",did bro just out himself

43,"Dec 2, 2021",I love how mad dokja gets when the sunfish says he is alone üòÇüòÇ‚Ä¶his face is like: what THE HELL ARE YOU SAYING?!?!???
43,"Dec 1, 2021",Now KISS!!!!!
43,"Nov 30, 2021",i want to appreciate how this comic is so well written... its weird and mind blowing. in the sense that it makes you feel like you skipped 300 episodes of the story but at the same time things actually make sense!!! i enjoy how everything abt jeonghyeok is being pieced back together (i would love to have ready abt the part where he had a child :c) and its only been 42 episodes :0 like what??! its a fast paced story so every episode after the prologue is satisfying. SUCH AN AMAZING PLOT <3
43,"Sep 11, 2021",Yo spoilers. But damn the line where he said he reads to survive really resonates with me 
43,"Sep 10, 2021","Lmao I‚Äôm rereading this for the like fifteenth time but I remember in the prologue at the beginning I used to think that he was a person in the future or something of Dokja since they looked the same but he was older lmao, I was so wrong "
43,"Sep 2, 2021",did the MC just drop spoilers about the MC ??
43,"Aug 28, 2021","wtf is blue star weapon aura üò≠ this translation is killing me, where‚Äôs Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship..."
43,"Aug 26, 2021",how to marry a drawing style üíî
43,"Aug 18, 2021","Well, this is a first. If you ever read other isekai webtoons or something with the protagonist having read a book, you know that every single one of them tries to hide that they are a transmigrator. Well that is except for Dokja Kim, who just screamed the spoilers to everyone."
43,"Aug 7, 2021",man i love dokja a Lot :/
43,"Aug 6, 2021",i always wonder why cooking is almost out of place among his skills..but who wouldn't love a man who can cook? yes! you fine man... hoping he'd join tha dokja faction now
43,"Jul 17, 2021",A CHILD?????
43,"Jul 15, 2021",that just made me tear up

43,"Jun 24, 2021","ugh novel readers giving spoilers here and there.. if indonesian site, i know they really love spoilers. but their spoilers are pleasant to read - they didnt spoil something far away, only spoil the near future like literally what happen, they didnt spoil anything that will spoil the fun..while reading the spoilers in english site are just like being mocked for not knowing, or they spoil something so far away or something too important "
43,"Jun 17, 2021",Dokja saying all the stuff that Junhyeuk yu went through hits so hard! 
43,"Jun 11, 2021",at least he wake up

43,"May 7, 2021",The yellow and blue color while fighting reminded me of Naruto and Sasuke
43,"May 6, 2021","I can only imagine Junghyeok saying ""OMAE...*sword clash* DARE DA OMAE!?"" if this gets animated.(please some studio better adapt and make a badass anime out of it GODDAMMIT!!)"
43,"May 5, 2021",Would be real funny if he pecked his forehead rn
43,"May 4, 2021",This WEBTOON to me is like twsa is to him it really help me get through though times

43,"May 3, 2021","Damn Dokja, you should have said ""spoiler alert!"" lmao. But on a serious note, I feel bad for the both of them "
43,"May 2, 2021",Hmm? I think this is in the prologue
43,"May 2, 2021",Dokja be dishing out those spoilers right now lol

43,"Aug 5, 2022",did he just exposed his self and spoiled the entire plot???üò≠üò≠üò≠

43,"Sep 8, 2021",Woah! Those spoilers Dokja! I wonder if it's Anna Croft or another prophet that will betray him. Junghyeok also used to have much more noble goals so the man must have suffered a lot through his past lives to grow so cold. He's going to fall in love and have a child only to lose it. I wonder how many times he's lost companions and loved ones. I wonder how Dokja will change the story. He doesn't have the luxury of regression so he has to do things perfectly the first time
43,"Sep 4, 2021",AGAHAHAH I'M SORRY BUT DOKJA'S FACE THE PANEL AFTER JUNGHYEOK SAID THAT HE WAS ALL ALONE OFTTTT

43,"Aug 9, 2022","umm.. That wasn't rational at all. I expected him to be more calm and calculative. It's not like he's dying or anything.

43,"Apr 14, 2021","Yeah ima call bullshit on him always being good and just, did he get dealt a bad hand? Yes, is he well meaning? Maybe but he‚Äôs a ducking sociopath at best."
43,"Feb 24, 2021","What I dislike about the main character, is that none of his abilities feel consistent or cohesive. He has no clear path of development. In the novel, at the most convenient times, he would pull single use items and tactics that would either break or lose their capability after being used once out of his ass at to save the day. It began to annoy me after a while and this is far from the last time this happens. This webtoon is nothing more than an interesting premise and lackluster execution."

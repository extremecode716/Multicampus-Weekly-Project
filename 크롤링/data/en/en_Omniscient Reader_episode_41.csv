Episode,Date,Review
41,"Feb 10, 2021",this is going to be a long week
41,"Feb 10, 2021",you can feel how powerful this story and the characters and will be 
41,"Feb 10, 2021",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' flipped table for being distracted while counting the number of total ghost ships and is now have to count from the beginning again..] [5 coins have been sponsored.]        „ÄäEdit 02152021: HAPPY BIRTHDAY KDJ üéÇ !!„Äã
41,"Feb 10, 2021","Dokja is being modest, while he abuses his knowledge for his own gain, he has saved people along the way. He hasn‚Äôt murdered any innocents in cold blood... "
41,"Feb 10, 2021","Man, I got chills when Jihye stood in the image of the Admiral"
41,"Feb 10, 2021",the contrast between dokja seeing these characters (to him) as people and the constellations seeing these people as only characters is very interesting and great storytelling.
41,"Feb 10, 2021","I feel that the use of history and fiction has always been a great plot point for most manga or stories, but to recreate it in a form that fits the background in a modern setting takes tremendous effort and I plead for the creator to keep up with  it"
41,"Feb 10, 2021","I understand why Dokja views himself as disgustimg and manipulative, but he is also a victim of situations. He just tries to stay alive, but his guilt doesn't allow him to see the good things he is doing for people as well. It's difficult, and I'm afraid that him being the reader will eventually get out üò≠"
41,"Feb 10, 2021",i really like her character and i feel like dokja is gonna lead her down a better character development path than the original main character
41,"Feb 10, 2021","Can we talk about how it's not just the art that's stunning , but also also story writing, characters & dialogue? The detail on the ghost fleet panel blows my mind, it's so evocative."
41,"Feb 10, 2021","I really feel for Jihye...it's one thing to kill a room full of strangers, but to kill a room full of classmates & friends? Damn. Also, I loved how the artist drew her ghost fleet stigma awakening! So much better than how I imagined it. Dokja has such a great team full of potential"
41,"Feb 10, 2021","""insert song from mulan"" Lets get down to business!"
41,"Feb 10, 2021","Dude, i dont know about yall but my favorite constilation is ['Lazy Broke Weeb']. 
Edit: They are here."
41,"Feb 10, 2021","Oh thats just wrong, she got sucked into the favorite movie of her dead friend :-( i can never imagine the hurt and i can never imagine the ass whooping those troops are going to get. I feel for you girl."
41,"Feb 10, 2021",Jihye just sunk my battleship. 
41,"Mar 31, 2021","I love how the female characters here are allowed to have massive amounts of power and be the heroes of certain fights, even though the MC is male. I feel like in most anime/manga, the girls are always overshadowed by the boys, but here, every member of Dokja's team has a chance to show off their power"
41,"Feb 10, 2021",I swear if they don‚Äôt make this into an anime I will cry 
41,"Feb 10, 2021",The right to live isn‚Äôt something your given you must earn it while your still alive....Epic Dokja 
41,"Feb 10, 2021",These new and upcoming stories give me real hope for what MCs can be in the future. You don‚Äôt need moral high ground because most of us don‚Äôt and I think that makes stories like these seem authentic and organic 
41,"Feb 10, 2021","Man, I can‚Äôt wait to see higher levels of Ghost Fleet."
41,"Feb 10, 2021",That long panel with all the ships was amazing! This author has such great visuals 
41,"Feb 10, 2021","Woah her character evolution just ""WOW"""
41,"Feb 10, 2021",gosh darn teared up from this chapter 
41,"Feb 10, 2021","How many coins must I spend for the time machine? At this point it's not about money, it's about INSTANT GRATIFICATION. I WANNA READ IT ALL RN."
41,"Feb 10, 2021",the art is so detailed and just overall gorgeous to look at i could just sit for hours appreciating it
41,"Feb 10, 2021","Dang, that ending gave me some chills. Can't wait till next week!"
41,"Mar 31, 2021",Let‚Äôs just take a second to realise how awesome the art work was in this episode
41,"Feb 10, 2021",My arms are gunna get sooo tired hanging off this cliff for another week...
41,"Apr 1, 2021",Orv's April Fool's thumbnail is definitely how every other character sees Dokja LMAOOO
41,"Feb 10, 2021",Can this please be the next anime adaption!!?!? CRUNCHYROLL!!!!! 
41,"Feb 11, 2021","""around chapter 40"" *reads that this is comic #40* yeah seems about right"
41,"Apr 1, 2021",HAHA DOKJA LOOKS ADORABLE IN THE COVER
41,"Mar 31, 2021","People might think he‚Äôs being harsh on her with what he said but honestly, I feel like he was also talking to himself in that moment. If you read it back the words he says could be a response to his own thoughts on leaving the people in the train to die or manipulating jihye. His face looks that way in the panel because he‚Äôs manipulating her in order to live. "
41,"Mar 31, 2021","reading the webnovel, I've always imagined how the ghost fleet army would look like. the artwork bring tears because it really potrays the description in the webnovel. Praise to the artists and studio for doing an amazing jobüò≠"
41,"Feb 14, 2021","I like that he appealed to her will to survive, rather than try to convince her that it's OK to kill your friends or something. She did what she had to, and that's the conflict. She made the winning choice, but at what cost? Survival. Now she needs to stick to that choice and see it through to the end. "
41,"Mar 31, 2021","in another translation, kdj said ""noone deserves to live but if you're alive then take responsibility for it!"" I liked that better."
41,"Feb 12, 2021",So anyone notice that Dokja said the reveal of her character was around chapter 40 while we're reading episode 40 of the Webtoon?
41,"Feb 10, 2021",I need the anime for this IMMEDIATELY THIS IS TOO HEAT
41,"Mar 31, 2021","That one Japanese soldier üòÇ I can just hear him going ""Nani?!"" "
41,"Mar 31, 2021","At first I thought of Jihye as a cold-hearted brat who killed her friends with no remorse and followed the original MC for the sake of attaining power.Only now I see how wrong I was. She was in fact, torn up with grief and regret over killing her friend, consumed by self-hatred to the point of almost giving up on life. Dokja's wise words convinced her to live and subsequently awaken her abilities in the coolest way possible!!! üî•ü§©ü§Øü§©üî•"
41,"Apr 1, 2021",Dokja peeking into that low quality book on the coverüò≠üò≠üò≠
41,"Apr 1, 2021",This cover art is the best and the really lil book he's holding-
41,"Apr 1, 2021",Haha Dokja looks a bit different today don‚Äôt u think? Can‚Äôt tell what tho
41,"Apr 1, 2021",huh? what do you mean the thumbnail changed? dokja always looked like this!!
41,"Apr 2, 2021","This story is amazing. I love that Dokja is so blunt about the very grey moral area he‚Äôs in. Also a random thought I‚Äôve had for a few chapters now: if this is Junghyeok‚Äôs third time living this life, where was Dokja the first two times? Is Dokja a ‚Äúunique character‚Äù who only exists in the current iteration of reality?"
41,"Apr 1, 2021",I CAN'T STOP CRACKING UP ABOUT THE OMNISCIENT READER PICTURE! ITS STINKING HILARIOUS HAHAHHAHAüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
41,"Apr 1, 2021",Finally a Thumbnail that I can Draw
41,"Mar 31, 2021","It's refreshing that our main characters aren't heroes, not perfect they're just humans that's why the story isn't way too predictable"
41,"Apr 2, 2021",KKKJSJKKKSKND thanks author for this messy dokja's face on april 1st I'll cherish it forever
41,"Apr 1, 2021",PLS DOKJA ON THE COVERüò≠
41,"Apr 1, 2021",AHAHAHHAHA PLS WHEN I SAW THE COVER AHAHHA üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
41,"Mar 31, 2021","Wow I got shivers when I saw Jihye standing in front of the commander... with the sword in the ground and an entire fleet of ships, she is amazing "
41,"Apr 1, 2021",Oh no it‚Äôs the April fools thing again XD
41,"Feb 16, 2021","please translator change to the original horific :"" I miss how gilyoung call dokja hyung nor his name, jihye call dokja ahjussi not mister or old man"
41,"Apr 1, 2021",the cover ‡≤•‚Äø‡≤•
41,"Apr 1, 2021",THE THUMBNAIL SLAPPSSSS THOOüëåüî•üî•
41,"Feb 10, 2021",The transformation.. strong female characters are always a plus point.. girl you rock..!! 
41,"Feb 10, 2021","Omg this is the fist time I write here. I'm dying for the next chapter, it's the best story"
41,"Feb 10, 2021",If that's the stigma she gets then I really wanna see what he got for the bounty
41,"Apr 1, 2021",Lmaoo the April 1st thumbnail for this one made me giggle who even drew that
41,"Mar 31, 2021","""In episode 40 of TWSA..."" - he says in episode 40 of Omniscient Reader. I hate that so much i can't help but smile."
41,"Mar 31, 2021","I did a double take after seeing his face while saying ""Or do you want to die?"". Like holy crap he looked dead himself. "
41,"Apr 1, 2021",LOL THE THUMBNAILS
41,"Apr 1, 2021","I got so confused about the cover lol, but also, April 1st is the birthday of a character who hasn't appeared yet!"
41,"Apr 1, 2021",The cover is holding a book instead of phone lol
41,"Mar 31, 2021",Ah that was cool. Her character is much more human feeling and relatable now. I'm really enjoying the direction her character is going. Man I hope we see Junghyeok Yu next chapter. It feels like it's been forever...
41,"Feb 10, 2021","Ah, I love the history of Admiral Yi.  Quite possibly the greatest naval commander in human history.  He‚Äôs the national hero of Korea for very good reason. "
41,"Apr 2, 2021","Jihye is truly one of the most fascinating characters. She‚Äôs suffered so much, yet she has the strength to keep moving forward while remaining absolute in her values. And truly, it‚Äôs no wonder she would earn the title ‚ÄòAdmiral‚Äô later on. Though she serves Junghyuk, I would argue that she probably cares more for Dokja, as he is the one who bonded with her, helped her push forward, helped her become strong. "
41,"Apr 2, 2021",I love how this is episode 40 and Dokja mentions that Jinye‚Äôs backstory is revealed in chapter 40 in the novel :O M E T A
41,"Apr 1, 2021","oh no Dokja, hun what did they do to you...???"
41,"Apr 1, 2021","I kinda sound like a jackass but I‚Äôm somewhat happy that her being responsible for her best friend‚Äôs death is eating Jihye up inside, it adds a lot more depth to her character, for instance: her aloofness and lack of empathy/compassion could be because she feels like she doesn‚Äôt deserve to feel that way since she so easily took away her friend‚Äôs life or because the guilt is so crippling she can‚Äôt be bothered/ is scared to empathize with people and their problems. All reminding her of her friend"
41,"Mar 31, 2021","This episode gave me chills. I love how the author up until this point has portrayed her as a regular, a little annoy and cocky teenager but shows that there is way more to her story and that she is remorseful for her killing her friend to survive. "
41,"Mar 31, 2021",omg when i got to this part of the novel i was crying jihye‚Äôs namee and like this ep did its justice cuz the visuals they add and use to convey the story is absolutely phenomenal. ‚ú®üëå
41,"Feb 11, 2021",That panel with Jihye standing and the image of the Admiral behind her is incredible
41,"Jun 10, 2021",Admiral Yi Sunshin (I believe Lee is also a correct translation as well) was the focus of my first major history paper in college and the reason my gen ed history teacher asked me why the hell I wasn't a history major. it wound up changing my whole trajectory and helping me become a historian. so you can imagine how FUCKING EXCITED I was when I knew where this was going!
41,"Apr 2, 2021","the webtoon really encouraged me to read the novel so here I am reading over 200 chapters now, wow, used 2 hate reading so much"
41,"Mar 31, 2021",after the title card it says that Lee Jihye's relation with the Admiral was revealed in episode 40 of twsa look at what episode we're on nowüòè
41,"Mar 31, 2021",This is usually a beautiful comic but this chapter was especially stunning! And it's nice to see how characters are dealing with their actions in that first test. 
41,"Jul 2, 2021","Ouch, my soul when it was revealed that this was her dead friend's favorite movie and then you see them happily watching it together, hnnn- Also the revelation that her constellation supported her because her ancester helped him in the past but was accused of treason and killed and instead his story lived on and his friend didn't so he wanted to honor his dead friend really hurt oof. At least she got the determination to live on despite what she did to get here. Dokja too, of course. (Pat pat)"
41,"Apr 3, 2021",I love when I fall a few weeks behind on this series so I can read more than one episode at a time... But I hate when I catch up. 
41,"Apr 1, 2021",LMAO the next thumbnail just encompasses all the emotions i felt reading this chapter-
41,"Apr 1, 2021","i made a comment in an earlier ep about whether dokja sees the others as allies or just a means to his own survival, and the fact that he's asking himself the same question speaks volume of his character."
41,"Mar 31, 2021",Imagine dying to a ghost ship üòÇüòÇ
41,"Mar 31, 2021","I get that it's kinda manipulative... but come on, 99% of the f4cking time they'll end up dead along side you if you don't.  You're doing them a favor by manipulating them, sto stop putting yourself down for it, damn it! "
41,"Feb 14, 2021",Dokja understands that there is no black and white morality in a world like this. There are a lot of grey areas to what you do to survive. Is it pleasant? Absolutely not but you have to ask yourself What would you do to survive?
41,"Feb 10, 2021",So much trauma and PTSD in just a few panels. Not sure what it says about us that we eagerly wait to read more.
41,"May 18, 2021",I cannot even beginning to imagine how long it took it draw this episode. Just look at the amount of detail! It‚Äôs incredible 
41,"Apr 30, 2021","that was so emotional ü•∫ also I now get how constellations work, sort of like in greek mythology where people are honored or commemorated by becoming constellations, the ones in the story are normal people who were that well remembered."
41,"Mar 31, 2021","First there was Huiwon's ability awakening; an emotional righteous act of vengeance, killing all the scum at the train station and getting revenge on the men who raped her.üî•‚öîÔ∏èüî•Now you have Jihye who finds the resolve to live even amongst her feelings of grief, remorse and self hatred over killing her friend. This manifests in her calling on the power of a naval god to summon an entire fleet of ghost ships!üåä‚õµüåä This webtoon never fails to astound me! Who's next I wonder?ü§î"
41,"Feb 10, 2021",when you realized the ghost fleet was the fleet that was supposed to be there to begin with. (jaw dropped) i love this webtune !
41,"Mar 24, 2021",alternate ending: the kid twirls the hammer around and lightning comes down from the heavens and sinks the enemies ships.
41,"Apr 1, 2021",seeing omniscient reader's logo: what the fu*kdokja: I'm looking that bad!!?? 
41,"Apr 1, 2021",Kim Dokja in the thumbnail lookin goodüò∂üëåüèª
41,"Mar 31, 2021",This Comic Never fails to amaze me. I adore how the characters interact and how they fight for victory now and every other time. Its just amazing!
41,"Mar 31, 2021",Imagine ominiscent reader ... but as an anime-
41,"Mar 31, 2021","aw man that was awsome, a really nice balance of fantasy action and human trauma. The characters aren't unfeeling killing machines but activly work through the trauma of having their world turned upside down. great job by the author it is a fine balance to manage"
41,"Mar 31, 2021","damn they are making these scene really cool, i wonder how the final battles will look like.revelation, oldest dream"
41,"Mar 31, 2021","""around ep 40 of twsa"" we're on ep 40"
41,"Mar 31, 2021",I wish this webtoon had music  üò´
41,"Mar 31, 2021",watching all of these stigmas come to life in the form of a drawing is just SO SATISFYING
41,"Mar 31, 2021",God I'm loving this. A morally grey hero who still feels like a person. 
41,"Mar 31, 2021","""Around episode 40 of TWSA..."" me: looks at episode number
 I see what you did there"
41,"Feb 13, 2021",while reading the I visualised everything BUT this artist showed me a better version. Author-nim and artist-nim I appreciate and respect you and Â§ßÂ•Ω„Åç„Å†„ÄÇ 
41,"Feb 10, 2021","This story is so amazing, I hope they do another event to get more people to read it!! It deserves all the hype!! üëèüëèüëè"
41,"Jul 31, 2021",the female characters in this are so GOOD
41,"Apr 2, 2021",I'm just binged this and I should say I'm suuuuper impressed!! I mean this is actually amazing!! I'm a huge fan of action webtoons and op/badass protagonists so this is like a treat for me!! I also love the moral ambiguity and how no one is black or white but grey... Loving this and can't wait to see how this unfolds!!
41,"Apr 2, 2021",I wish I hadn‚Äôt read this yet. Did 1-40 today alone and I‚Äôm craving more! 
41,"Apr 2, 2021",can we just take a moment and just admire the art
41,"Apr 1, 2021",I love seeing Jihye's stigma. It was amazing
41,"Apr 1, 2021",He is Reading da Book!! RESPECT
41,"Apr 1, 2021",Best WEBTOON by a long shot! The impact of the story and the amazing battles they face are so good!
41,"Mar 31, 2021",The panel with the ghost ships looks freaking beautiful 
41,"Mar 31, 2021",I know it might sound absurd to say...but this episode actually gave me chills. The way the art compliments the story telling is just perfect!!!
41,"Mar 31, 2021",this has to become an anime. I MEAN COME ON 
41,"Mar 31, 2021","If you had an impact on history, and a lot of people remember you, do you go to the afterlife for constellations?"
41,"Feb 10, 2021",I can't help wonder; What Stigma Dokja is going to get from the Naval Warfare God?
41,"Feb 10, 2021",[The constellation 'Blacklight Master Raveras' is pleased with Jihye's resolution and impressed with how she bounced back from that level of despair. 5 coins have been gifted]
41,"Apr 8, 2021",i feel like it hasn't been recognized much but this webtoon's different angles for each panel is amazing!! I really love that part when the ships appeared and some water tornadoes were seen from aerial view. damnnn im in awe
41,"Apr 6, 2021","Did you know that ""omniscient reader"" means ""the narrator reader, who knows more about the characters, then the characters themselves"""
41,"Apr 6, 2021","I just finished re-reading the series and now have much more insight into it. I highly recremend reading through the series again as you understand parts of the Webtoon a lot more, providing a better experiance."
41,"Apr 4, 2021",YEAAAAAAAH GOD I LOVE THIS SCENE SO MUCH I GOT CHILLS WHILE READING IT!!! THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE SO GOOD!!!!
41,"Mar 31, 2021",Dokja's face in the next thumbnail is my reaction while reading this chapter
41,"Mar 31, 2021",Honestly if this were to ever become an anime I‚Äôd watch the everlasting shit out of it bc the story is amazing and the character development keeps surprising me 
41,"Mar 31, 2021",every character is being hyped at some or the other point of story.  I enjoy this webtoon alot. 
41,"Mar 31, 2021",my nose started acting funky when they showed the scene of jihye and her friend enjoying at theater :^)
41,"Feb 10, 2021",it's times like these that I recognize that every one of these characters are broken emotionally in some way.
41,"Jul 25, 2021",Dokja is not a good person. There is no good people in this world. Dokja is a good person to his friends but to other people he is the villain. Someone can be a good person to you but not a good person to others. Naturally to me he has done nothing wrong but to others it might not seem that way.
41,"Jun 5, 2021","wow, i can feel the chills "
41,"Apr 29, 2021",The women in this comic are outstanding! I‚Äôm so happy they get to shine and show their strength as well. 
41,"Apr 29, 2021",Can we just take a moment please to appreciate the artwork?
41,"Apr 7, 2021",The art is just beautiful. I wonder how much time it took to make the ships panel
41,"Apr 7, 2021","this naval battle is actually based on a legendary event in korean history. please go check out the movie or research a bit on this battle if you have time. the title is ""roaring currents"" and it's really inspirational. thank you! :)"
41,"Apr 4, 2021",Nothing beats this plot twist and the story lines. For real this worth the money.

And it seems like she was really nonchalant in the original ch. 40 talking about her relations w/o being traumatized, so how it ended up being different? The readers who read it were in an uproar cuz of her relations to the admiral, but she was related to the friend instead. So did the readers at the time just mistaken her words when she was unclear about being ""related to some admiral"" and dokja found out the precise relation later?"

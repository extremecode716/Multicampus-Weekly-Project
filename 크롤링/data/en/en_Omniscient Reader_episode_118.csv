Episode,Date,Review
118,"Aug 17, 2022","They miss this part of the novel: ""If I was really a god, then I was the most incompetent god in the world. The most helpless god in the world who knew everything but couldn't explain anything."" ~ Kim Dokja "
118,"Aug 17, 2022","The artistic quality here is incredible... Every single panel is just too beautiful for words. Yuseung is really sweet. And it's so rare to see Dokja's expressions like this, completely unguarded and earnest; this is who he really is. And then there is the way he relates everything he feels towards learning to understand Junghyeok better... This episode is precious. 💖"
118,"Aug 17, 2022",SAVE HEEERRR😭❤She's so precious. I almost cried and actually still might😭
118,"Aug 17, 2022",Quality trumps quantity people. Gorgeous art. Killer story. Deep characters. Coins spent on Omniscient Reader are always well spent. 
118,"Aug 17, 2022","i think it’s clear that dokja makes a lot of decisions based on the practicality of it; he chooses who should live and who should die based on how useful they’ll be. it’s not surprising for some to think that he is almost cruel and emotionally detached (esp w the 4th wall), but i see this scene and the pure emotion on his face and it’s just such a nice juxtaposition that shows his most human side even when he’s always calculating and scheming "
118,"Aug 17, 2022",if you don't know your history you are doomed to repeat the same mistakes
118,"Aug 17, 2022","""Save me"", ""I will"" This chapter is so beautiful 😭💖💕 It may be short but the art is drawn so beautifully"
118,"Aug 17, 2022","I'm so torn. Part of me really wants to hunt down the webnovel and read it so that I can get all of the answers, but the other part has been reading this webtoon for 3 years now and feels like that might be a betrayal and would ruin it. 🫣 I need them to do another mass release event! I will happily spend coins on 10 releases in a week!"
118,"Aug 17, 2022",Omg Yuseung gave him a wee peck 🥲 so precious. 
118,"Aug 17, 2022",The art in this chapter was gorgeous! the gold and glowing effects are the best
118,"Aug 17, 2022",Interesting how the penalty for failure is just being banned from the world. I thought she would just kill him for bluffing
118,"Aug 17, 2022","oh my god they drew this so beautifully😭😭😭 don't worry best daughter, we are coming for you!!!"
118,"Aug 17, 2022",even though it's not that long I think I speak for everyone when I say I was tearing up by the end
118,"Aug 17, 2022",I hope that Yuseung still retains her memories of Dokja after he saves her
118,"Sep 21, 2022","This chapter is great for numerous reasons. But mainly for one. Throughout the series we see Dokja as a cunning, almost manipulative guy. He sees many people and events as a means to an end. Which makes it all the more great that dokja doesn't help yuseung because it benefits him, he helps her because he wants to. For a guy that is pretty cunning and all about getting to a means end, that is surprisingly sweet."
118,"Aug 17, 2022",I have few series that I spend coins on this is one I will never miss. I love this webcomic the writing and art is spectacular and the story feels alive. 
118,"Aug 17, 2022",😭😭😭😭 dokjas expressions in this chapter are so 😭😭 and bb shin yuseung my beloved im sure he'll come to save you someday 🥺🥺🥺😭😭
118,"Aug 17, 2022",He made contact with her soul but still unable to save her huh. We will wait with you Yuseung. 
118,"Aug 18, 2022",And here we see the Dokja who truly cares for and loves the characters of the novel.
118,"Aug 17, 2022","Go save her, Dokja!!! 🏃🏻💨 Go go go!"
118,"Aug 17, 2022","I'M NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING."
118,"Sep 21, 2022",I have a theory and hear me out. I think the secretive plotter is Dokja from the future
118,"Aug 17, 2022",This chapter? Magnificent. My impatience to know more? Way too big for me. ORV's emotional scenes never miss the mark and always twist my heart
118,"Aug 17, 2022",The story reader has become a God 
118,"Aug 17, 2022","This is such a beautiful episode. Made me cry, happy and sad all at once😭😭😭I know that Dokja can do it but uhhh man, this just hits all the right spots. Thank you❤️"
118,"Aug 17, 2022",SHIN YOOSOUNGGG THE ART IS SO BEAUTIFUL BRO
118,"Aug 17, 2022","[Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" hopes she doesn't lose nearly all of her stories and forgets almost everything. 5 coins have been sponsored.]"
118,"Aug 17, 2022",i really hope im helping both the author & artist by spending my coins..... this webtoon became so precious to me <33
118,"Sep 21, 2022",What kinda foreshadowing was that??? Is dokja a goddd???!!!! (Novel readers leave me alone)
118,"Aug 17, 2022","I think everytime I read this, I always discover something new"
118,"Aug 17, 2022",the final panel is absolutely stunning. the art in this series is really out of this world!
118,"Sep 22, 2022",I think dokja might be the author of the book he read 
118,"Sep 21, 2022",A god? foreshadowing perhaps??
118,"Sep 21, 2022",There are...there are stars in Dokja's eyes
118,"Sep 21, 2022",It suddenly came to my attention that this story's world has an odd look on beauty.Like how tf YALL gone say Dokja less than average and he looks like a Kpop idol!?!?!?!
118,"Sep 26, 2022","The small light shivered a few times before speaking in a hesitant voice.–Ahjussi.
Perhaps she was influenced by the memories of the young Shin Yoosung.
–…C-Can I call you that? No…?
The way she called me was a bond. It was a wish to be tied somewhere. Perhaps 'ahjussi' was the last lingering attachment of the 41st regression Shin Yoosung. I smiled softly."
118,"Sep 21, 2022",DOKJA IS FRIKING PRETTY IN THIS EPISODE 😭😭
118,"Sep 21, 2022","""He was told not to look behind him in his way back to the living realm"" if there's anything I've learned from folktales, always listen to the advice of powerful beings, they don't always want what's best for you, but they're usually right"
118,"Aug 17, 2022",this episode pulled my heart strings idk even know why!! i wanna know the rest of the story immediately!!!!
118,"Sep 22, 2022","I don't know about you lot, but I like to think that the secret plotter constellation is actually the author of twsa"
118,"Sep 22, 2022",This is the best chapter so far. It is not because of the incredible art quality but the immense amount of story woven in just a few panels of dialogue. Dokja being given a true reason to fight and plot against the gods not just for survival gives us something we can relate to. A cause for morality and emotion. Well Done.
118,"Sep 21, 2022",Is it just me or dokja looks hella handsome in this chapter.....!!!??
118,"Sep 21, 2022",Dang what a pretty chapter
118,"Sep 21, 2022","""Almost as if I'm in the presence of a god"" with all he has achieve and all he plans to, he kinda is"
118,"Sep 23, 2022",Banned from entering the underworld? Does that mean he’ll be immortal?
118,"Sep 22, 2022",The art looks absolutely gorgeous this episode
118,"Sep 22, 2022",Applauding the top comment of sharing one of the lines I really wished they included somehow in the webtoon.
118,"Sep 22, 2022","The art, oh God, the art. Also, this chapter really made me soft 🥺🥺🥺 Dokja and yuseung are so precious ㅠ.ㅠ ㅠ.ㅠ"
118,"Sep 22, 2022","So the reason the 6th scenario has already begun is because time flows differently where he is, if I understood that correctly."
118,"Sep 22, 2022",orv is breathtaking in every way 
118,"Sep 21, 2022",go save your daughter Kim dokja 😭😭💔
118,"Sep 21, 2022",that episode seemed short. but i appreciate it just the same.
118,"Sep 21, 2022","I think I know a good reason to why he’s like a god, he’s “consumed” quite the story, similar to how the gods do. Albeit it’s not the same way, but the source of his knowledge is the same"
118,"Sep 21, 2022",bro looks elegant
118,"Sep 21, 2022",I am once again asking why I can’t like an episode more than once. This one deserves it
118,"Sep 21, 2022",Gosh why does Dokja have to be so pretty. It is bad for my heart.
118,"Sep 21, 2022",Wise words. My mind is broken but I understood it
118,"Sep 20, 2022",I spent my first 5 coins on this manga😃🤩🤩🤩🤩it WAS WORTH IT ✨✨✨✨
118,"Aug 18, 2022",even though every week I'm using coins 🪙 for this webtoon but it's so worth it....I literally save coins just to read omniscient reader...this webtoon is so 👌 🙌 
118,"Oct 3, 2022","Are we not talking about how handsome Dokja looks in this episode with the lights and all that? I dunno why they keep calling him ugly (Actually I know why, there's no need to tell me)"
118,"Sep 28, 2022",Day 117 of voicing all the characters
118,"Sep 27, 2022",Kinda wanted him to take Namwoon with him. No idea how he would've. Just a random desire that popped up when I saw how different he was in the underworld.
118,"Sep 27, 2022","o.m.g. I've caugt up to the latest chapter in 2days. 2 years of work, consumed in 2 days."
118,"Sep 27, 2022",BRO HOW IS THE ART SO GOOD???
118,"Sep 25, 2022",i CANT WAIT FOR THE THING IN THE NOVEL TO HAPPEN. I CANT WAIT TO SEE HER BE. you would know if you read the novel.
118,"Sep 22, 2022",I NEED another chapter... guess that makes me a desperate reader *ba-dam-ta-tish*
118,"Sep 22, 2022",Kim Dokja looks so pretty here omg <33 The art is as beautiful as always!! Can't wait for the 6th scenario. I'm curious about ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛'s design. They're one of my favourite characters from the novel :))
118,"Sep 22, 2022","I wanna thank those who put parts of the novel in the comments, it's really interesting to read"
118,"Sep 22, 2022",Oh.... ⚠️ NOVEL SPOILERS & KDJ's thoughts that didn't included in the manhwa ⚠️
118,"Sep 22, 2022",The way I paused to admire every panel of Dokja’s face 😭
118,"Sep 21, 2022",The emotions in thus one are very high and apparent..the visuals are absolutely gorgeous! You save her like you promised you hear 😤

118,"Oct 3, 2022",Her spirit orb just kissed him on the cheeks 😭AFKGJJGMCMCLD
118,"Oct 2, 2022",if he is banned from the underworld then no matter what he does he'll only go to heaven?
118,"Sep 26, 2022",This webcomic needs a soundtrack/score.
118,"Sep 25, 2022",*sob* this was so beautiful *sob* 🥺😭
118,"Sep 25, 2022","Ixchelita (1st top comment - novel reader) mention a line from the novel and im having so much mixed feelings, Kim Dokja is so precious <3"
118,"Sep 24, 2022",the hidden scenario says he is banned from the underworld! that means he will be in limbo if he fails!
118,"Sep 24, 2022","despite its amount of panels, there was sm in this chapter"
118,"Sep 24, 2022","Crying, this is incredible.  I really hope he’s able to reach her in time."
118,"Sep 23, 2022",rip. the text isn't as fancy in this version 
118,"Sep 23, 2022",Realm ban for possibly failing a scenario
118,"Sep 23, 2022",yuseung foreshadowing the story lol
118,"Sep 23, 2022",At first I thought not being able to enter the underworld could be used as a buff but then I remembered that ALL of the afterworlds exist here.
118,"Sep 23, 2022",What. A. FORESHADOW!
118,"Sep 23, 2022","this episode was so so so beautiful, and felt so short as well :'( "
118,"Sep 23, 2022",you know what I blame you for making me not do my work 
118,"Sep 22, 2022",CANNOT BELIEVE I MISSED TWO. UPDATES. AND ABSOLUTELY FUCKING FANTASTIC ONES TOO LIKE 😭😭 MARCY YOU IDIOT. But anyways. Literally in t e a r s this episode is cradling my heart gently and wiping away my tears and I’ve never been good at responding to kindness. The ART though??? Absolutely stunning. I say this every time but now more than ever because the way I could viscerally feel the fear and hope they held just leaves me in pieces. Ok I have to sleep but I will write more tomorrow oh my GOD
118,"Sep 22, 2022","Kudos to the direction and artist of ORV, it's exactly what I imagined while reading the novel"
118,"Sep 22, 2022",20 bucks this entire this is just Kim Dokjas self insert fan fic

118,"Sep 22, 2022",There’s a novel??
118,"Sep 22, 2022",This…is a really good story.
118,"Sep 21, 2022",THERES SO MUCH SKIPPED FROM THE LIGHT NOV APPARENTLY BUT ITS STILL SO WELL WRITTEN AND GORGEOUS! this author / illustrator are talented. 
118,"Sep 21, 2022","So was that mission like really vague? Cause he opened a sub scenario, and with some sub scenarios the prize is pretty clear on what you will get, like the movie theatre sub mission. But with this one he wanted the girl back, but he also got the trust of Persephone and 80,000 coins. If he did anything differently and Persephone didn’t like him as much would he have gotten less money? "
118,"Sep 21, 2022",art of this chapter is so gorgeous it gets me immersed with it
118,"Sep 21, 2022",penalty for failure: banned from entering the underworld. does that mean that he won't die or go to heaven instead if he actually did 
118,"Sep 21, 2022",i want to hug her so badly. 
118,"Sep 21, 2022",i should cry but that exit looks like a glowing di*ck 👁️👄👁️
118,"Sep 21, 2022",… so he is going to regress…??
118,"Sep 21, 2022",God this chapter was so short but also so good 
118,"Sep 21, 2022",If only Yuseung knew that Dokja does know her. A lot. Made me tear up a lot reading this
118,"Sep 21, 2022",As the likes decreases it mean the Amount of people reading is decreasing  which one of us will be the last reader?
118,"Sep 21, 2022","wait so if ur banned from the underworld, can you like, not die??"
118,"Sep 21, 2022",His eyes sparkling like a stars 😖
118,"Sep 21, 2022","This story is beyond incredible.. it drags you in, and it feels so real at times, like it actually has something to do with everything they relate to in so many ways (edit) it's creatively insane "
118,"Sep 21, 2022",He is an all knowing reader after all.

118,"Sep 21, 2022",Save her!!
118,"Sep 21, 2022","The foreshadowing is high in this one. I wonder who can guess it right, other than those who read the novel."
118,"Sep 21, 2022",the amount of foreshadowing is going to hit real hard later
118,"Sep 21, 2022",ough the saving and salvation and saving when you're unworthy of being saved (you are worthy. you're just being stupid) and being saved by someone who can't save themselves *just fucking evaporates*
118,"Sep 21, 2022","I need 80,000 coins for all the fast passing I wish I could do, and see where this arc goes"
118,"Sep 21, 2022","lol , basically if he lose the quest does he become immortal since he is banned from entering the underworld?XD"
118,"Sep 21, 2022",baat!!  <(:3)
118,"Sep 21, 2022",dokja took 'why be a king when you can be a god' seriously 💀
118,"Sep 21, 2022","[Penalty: Banned From the Underworld]
That doesn’t bode well for someone as prone to dying as Dokja is.

118,4 days ago,"""People are the sum of their stories""
Just a snippet of how good the writing is for this story. Such an amazing play on the Greek belief of legacy and the impact of humanity and the human life itself. All we are at the end of the day is what we are remembered for"
118,"Oct 9, 2022","""Banned from entering the underworld"" won't this mean he'll be immortal?"
118,"Oct 2, 2022",I hope she hasn't lost herself by the time he saves her.

118,"Sep 30, 2022",Im sorry uh...Bl reader here why'd that door look kinda like a censored you know what🤔
118,"Sep 30, 2022",the game with the lights and the shadows in the drawings are sooooooo goooooodd I love it
118,"Sep 30, 2022",it's getting more interesting as the chapter keeps going.
118,"Sep 29, 2022",I love the way this story feels as unique as the original with a completely different way of interpreting the great story that this really is. Gotta love foreshadowing

118,"Sep 24, 2022","I love how all the light effects where done throughout this chapter, those sparks and shines were truly beautiful. I know Dokja will succeed, for his is Dokja, but banishment from the Underworld isn't that severe a penalty from a god-given quest either."

118,"Sep 22, 2022",The art in this chapter(just like every chapter honestly) is top notch. So impressive how you use foreshortening and color. 
118,"Sep 22, 2022","the art, i mean wow... the way dokja was drawn on this chapter 🧍✨ yall the kimcom was really missing out"

118,"Sep 22, 2022","The art looks slightly different here... and the visuals and expressions are so beautiful. And I gotta say, I love the 'people are made of stories' thing going on throughout this story ♡"
118,"Sep 22, 2022","Go Dokja go, find your loved ones, free your loved ones, reunite and crush all those future scenarios together ^^"
118,"Sep 22, 2022",That seemed incredibly short.
118,"Sep 22, 2022","This was such a heartbreaking chapter for Dokja trying to save Yunseong, the story just keeps getting better and better 👍"

118,"Sep 21, 2022",i think i must read the novel too now
118,"Sep 21, 2022","Man, this chapter was way too short 😫 it makes waiting a week to read it feel so much longer"
118,"Sep 21, 2022",Who’s cutting onions?
118,"Sep 21, 2022",This is so beautiful 🥺
118,"Sep 21, 2022",Tbh I wasn’t expecting stakes in this story. I thought it just was another apocalyptic power fantasy and I was fine with it. But absolutely I’m hyped for where the story is heading right now. 
118,"Sep 21, 2022",❤ This episode is awesome like every one of your episode ❤ Fighting!!!!!
118,"Sep 21, 2022",Why does Dokja looks like Levi
118,"Sep 21, 2022",aww he got mistaken as a god
118,"Sep 21, 2022",the emotions dokja protrayed here is so good that i can cry.
118,"Sep 21, 2022","it's insane that the moment sys's soul appeared, i suddenly cried T—T"
118,"Sep 21, 2022",oh gosh that was beautiful

118,"Sep 21, 2022","""People are the sum of their stories..."" Someone please explain to me why I love this line so much, while it simultaneously punches me in the gut...??"
118,"Sep 21, 2022",the penalty from being banned from the underworld i always interpreted it as hes not allowed to go back there to get shin yoosoungs soul and as a living being. Not allowed to visit cause if he succeeds he will get in the good graces of persephone and hades so he will probably be allowed to visit as a living being. not that if he dies he will he sent to a different afterlife. 
118,"Sep 21, 2022","this felt like such a short episode (maybe it really was, maybe not), I was kinda expecting him to get into the 6th scenario already but I'm glad this was here, really dug into the emotional throughline of 41st round yuseung"
118,"Sep 21, 2022",bro plssss the lighting in this chapter is just ✨✨🤌
118,"Sep 21, 2022",aww that was way too short 
118,"Sep 21, 2022",This chapter is drawn extra artistic it’s very detailed and beautiful as will. 
118,"Sep 21, 2022",so you're telling me that should dokja fail this mission he becomes emortal. sounds like a win win to me

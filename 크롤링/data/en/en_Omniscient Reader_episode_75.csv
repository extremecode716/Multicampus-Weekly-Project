75,"Nov 24, 2021",Oh no. . .our Scenario.  .IT'S BROKEN
75,"Nov 24, 2021",Wait.. if both Dokja and Suyeong gave their energy to hatch the Moon Stone which looks like an egg then does that make them the theoretical parents of Lycaon? Lol.

75,"Nov 24, 2021",I don't know why looking at this ancient  wolf losing his shit was so hilarious... 🤣🤣 I'll call it the Dokja Effect. 😂
75,"Oct 20, 2021",she is just casually browsing the dokaebbi shop while all this is going down.
75,"Oct 20, 2021","Cue the angry furry also cue the swarm of furrys cue the Owo scenario, survive all the bonks, don’t be caught thirsty , don’t become down bad duration as long as the guides around"
75,"Dec 1, 2021","I can't be the only one that has come to this conclusion but is the person that's traumatized him more than the school bully and the one who he told about TWSA his mother? There have been a few mentions of her and they haven't been exactly flattering, as he said that that person was the only person he could talk too about the book at the time."
75,"Dec 1, 2021",Can't stop laughing at how he went from shocked puppy to mad dog 🤣

75,"Nov 27, 2021",can I say that I caught up with this series after I found it 2 days ago around the same time now but I can fast pass because I don't have enough coins so I'm devastated. 
75,"Nov 27, 2021",I'm surprise she didnt get the other world languange skill.
75,"Nov 26, 2021",Who's here thinks that the first wolf would look intimidating but turns out he looks cutee
75,"Nov 26, 2021",Love the amount of thirst for Lycaon in this comment section. The furries are winning today and honestly?? Good for them.
75,"Nov 25, 2021",the airbending furry is here
75,"Nov 25, 2021",Wolf dude looks freaking epic. 
75,"Nov 25, 2021","I have a slight feeling that they're monitoring this sub-scenario pretty loosely tbh. Because this sub-scenario wasn't meant to originally happen, the guides were meant to appear at the throne and the next scenario was meant to begin. It's just kind of a sub-scenario to allow for the guides to be found since the guides aren't transported to the throne (since the throne is destroyed), otherwise everyone would just be thrown into the next scenario with no guides."
75,"Nov 25, 2021",Lycaon has some pretty eyes. Well it did until Dokja pissed it off
75,"Nov 25, 2021",he's kinda.... he's kinda *lipbite*

75,"Nov 24, 2021","yep, dokja's super power is pissing people off. "
75,"Nov 24, 2021",The catastrophe? Not here yet. Fourth scenario? Completed. Ruler’s Throne? Broke it. || Lycaon: 😱🤬
75,"Nov 24, 2021","Damn, an entire prison's worth of people were really just saved by the intensity of Dokja's mommy issues."
75,"Nov 24, 2021",all that aside. lycaon is so pretty????? 
75,"Nov 24, 2021",That wolf kinda pretty ngl
75,"Nov 24, 2021",I know Dokja is under the surviving scenario and he should eat but I haven't seen him eat and I'm concerned

75,"Nov 25, 2021",omg Lycaon is beautiful!
75,"Nov 25, 2021","I'm guessing Lyacon knew the world would end if the 4th scenario was completed. I'm guessing he remorses our world cause his was ending And he couldn't save it. With 5th scenario guides they would just be other world survivors. Trying to tell us how to survive when our world ends. Dokja saving it, means the wolf man has no purpose. But I assume the wolf would be glad he dosen't have to go through it again. And will help them out to prevent the end."
75,"Nov 25, 2021","Ah yes, the best way to get help from a guide to not destroy the world… piss him off"
75,"Nov 25, 2021",how dahek do you pronounce his name? lai-kaon? lee-keon? wha?

75,"Oct 21, 2021",I can’t tell if Lycaon’s pissed or scared but I already want to pet him.
75,"Oct 20, 2021","I'm fairly certain that woman is Dokja's therapist, if she's not his mum, that is. "
75,"Oct 20, 2021",That cliffhanger hurts me on a spiritual level.
75,"Oct 20, 2021",Anyone else catch that “the Plagiarist” had access to the Dokkaebi store?
75,"Oct 20, 2021",Love the pacing of this webtoon!

75,"Jan 21, 2022","dokja was supposed to eat three meals a day, it's nighttime now and he probably hasn't eaten anything has he? "
75,"Jan 3, 2022",Am not a furry but dang lycaon is attractive （╹◡╹）♡

75,"Dec 22, 2021",I'm sorry. Lycaon is a beautiful name but why am I thinking of lycra
75,"Dec 14, 2021",oooooooohhhh so that person is his mom yeh?
75,"Dec 12, 2021","So
coming back to the web comic after reading the entire web novel.

And I just wanna say I cannot wait for all of it to get turned into a comic."
75,"Dec 8, 2021",So no ones gonna mention his probably mom? okay then.
75,"Dec 8, 2021",dokja : we destroyed the rulers throne lycaon: you WHAT
75,"Dec 3, 2021",Lycaon 😳
75,"Dec 3, 2021","My dude, why is your personal skill pissing off any entity with incredible speed 😂"
75,"Nov 30, 2021",Oh man! No one is talking about all those constellations hanging out around Dojka!! It looks so cool
75,"Nov 28, 2021",lycaon lost 12 years from his life just by talking to dojka for 5 minutes 🤣
75,"Nov 28, 2021",oh shit some Constellations that are Furries are gonna reveal themselves aren't they?We are Fucked
75,"Nov 28, 2021",Hot werewolf alert 🚨🚨🚨 please bless us with a human transformation it’s all I’m asking 🙏🏼

75,"Nov 28, 2021",Lycaon better drop the hair routine👀
75,"Nov 27, 2021",oooo we're about to see an epic dokja training montage
75,"Nov 26, 2021","Ok, so something I think would be cool is a potential future werewolf ally. In 71, we can tell Minu Song is mostly the same person even after a werewolf transformation (at least as same of a person as most people are after all this), meaning werewolves are not mindless (though possibly more animalistic and rageful). And in this chapter, we learn that one of these meteorites can 'evolve' a person into a werewolf, so canibalism is obviously not the only way to transform."
75,"Nov 26, 2021",intense training arc be like fug for baam 
75,"Nov 26, 2021",Dude just made a lyscon mad like crazy in less then 5 minutes 😂😂😂😭😭😭
75,"Nov 26, 2021",furry-
75,"Nov 26, 2021",is he gonna turn into a big bad wolf?
75,"Nov 26, 2021","All I’m saying is that that particular Meteorite is great, but it’s practically useless for Dokja 😂. Ah, I missed her. She’s honestly really great. I can’t wait for that scene between her and Dokja… lol I fucking KNEW they’d make him hot "
75,"Nov 26, 2021",glad to see our furry friends getting someone to simp for
75,"Nov 26, 2021",im down bad for lycaon 😍
75,"Nov 26, 2021",Why he kinda…
75,"Nov 26, 2021",Wearwolf alien is now pissed off.  I think Dokja did this because this werewolf might be a good original story guide to the plagerizer.  
75,"Nov 26, 2021",Your conversation skills....👌🏻 Your attitude....🙏🏻 Your knowledge....🙏🏻👌🏻  BUT THE WAY YIUR EYES LAUGH-
75,"Nov 26, 2021","Cause he is Dokja, that is why. In other terms, WAS THAT REALLY DOKJAS' MOTHER OR SISTER?!?!?"
75,"Nov 25, 2021","ah right, isn't lycaon the stupid guy in Greek mythology who fed his son to the gods. and none ate but Dementer who was searching for her daughter Persephone(who was kidnapped by hades)?!then he got punished."

75,"Nov 24, 2021","the reactions are epic, I love it"
75,"Nov 24, 2021",Is it weird to already have a crush with Lycaon? Cause I do and I don't care if it is(๑♡⌓♡๑)
75,"Nov 24, 2021",Otherworldly entity: Acting - level 4.   Me: 🤨🤨

75,"Nov 24, 2021",i love this lycaon wolf already😂
75,"Nov 24, 2021","I wonder what time it was when they started feeding their mana to the moon stone....Cuz if we suppose that the ""night"" is from 8pm to 6am, there's only 10hours.... so even if they went as first planned (4hrs for Dokja and 6 for Suyeong) Suyeong would never have her 6hours of sleep at night if it was night already.... wouldn't it mean death ???"
75,"Nov 24, 2021","Lycaon looks so good!*^*
Is she Dokjas mother or sister?x3"
75,"Nov 24, 2021",dungeon master in a nutshell when the players derail his/her plan
75,"Nov 24, 2021",I bet she is his therapist
75,"Nov 24, 2021","i didn't get the last dailogue,  ""the constellations, did you-"" ""thats right."" what exactly was the fluffy doggo referring to? I haven't read this is a while so I probably need to re-read the previous episodes but can someone explain this dialohue to me?"
75,"Nov 24, 2021","""how could you do such a thing!?""""with a sword...."" "
75,"Nov 24, 2021",Dokkan you cannot just say lol i destroyed  this thing that was important to some hunky wolf warrior guy thing
75,"Nov 24, 2021","im sorry but why didnt the plaigiarist get the same coin and skill buff that the reader got?? they both completed this job together, and she gave MUCH more mana. if anything is implausible, it's that."

75,"Nov 24, 2021",I want another episode 😩 😫 
75,"Nov 24, 2021","Man how I love this comic, it just gets better chap by chap. Also since Sugyeong Han and her dynamic with Dokja was introduced, the plot is so much more enjoyable. Keep up the great work artist(s)! Ed: I mean, it missed those ""light/resting plot moments"" without her, you know what I mean?"
75,"Nov 24, 2021",don't like to scroll through comments because all the phosphates come here to give spoilers..
75,"Nov 24, 2021",Wolf is angy

75,"Nov 24, 2021",my furry senses are tingling
75,"Nov 24, 2021",I'm liking the art more and more. It would be even better if the fight scenes were portrayed like Solo Leveling. 
75,"Nov 24, 2021","way to go Dokja, way to go 😅😂"
75,"Nov 24, 2021",I was expecting a cute little creature to come outta that meteorite n kinda adopt dokja as it's dad🙂

75,"Nov 24, 2021","embarrassed to say that for a second, thought it was Anubis showing up.. *sighs * looks nothing alike.. anyways.. what a handsome boi. Love the outfit. Wondering how much of a problem Dokja throwing things off is o.o "
75,"Nov 24, 2021",Dokja continues to be problematic 
75,"Nov 24, 2021",The old wolf is cute even when he's angry 🐾
75,"Nov 24, 2021",So… what you’re saying is… someone else knows just as much about this world as Dokja does. And that may or may not be terrifying 
75,"Nov 24, 2021",I love Dokja's shocked face when he finds out Sooyoung's mana level 😂
75,"Nov 24, 2021",How? Like this! *punches him into the dirt*
75,"Nov 24, 2021",When did Dokja got the protection symbol of Imyuntar?
75,"Nov 24, 2021",furry
75,"Nov 24, 2021",Question: what is the wolf man talking about when he said “wait all these constellations…”? 
75,"Nov 24, 2021",His legs looks funny 
75,"Nov 24, 2021","sorry man, we believe in democracy "
75,"Nov 24, 2021","wolf's this days,tsk tsk easily pissed off"
75,"Nov 24, 2021","How does she have access to the Dokkaebi Store? Was there a quest she cleared that allows a person access to it? Or did Dokja simply let her use his? Also, the constellations being visible behind Dokja... what does that mean? That they're watching him? Or that they're trying to recruit him?"
75,"Nov 24, 2021",I already know people are gonna be simping over it
75,"Nov 24, 2021","""WhY wOuLd YoU dO sUcH a ThInG?"" ""Steven? Steven is that you?😀 Stevennn, how are you enjoying that advanced copy?"" ""I'm playing with my fAmIlY!"" ""Oh that's right!

75,"Nov 24, 2021","Dokja, you gotta stop pissing everyone you first meet off."
75,"Nov 24, 2021","yo, probably best birthday of ma life with one of the best manhwa. :D"
75,"Nov 24, 2021",lycanroc got a upgrade dang
75,"Nov 24, 2021",I feel like at some point they will offer doja a chance to be a constellation and he’ll just pull a Percy Jackson and refuse
75,"Nov 24, 2021",damn i want to just burry my face on Lycon's fur ngl
75,"Nov 24, 2021",Lycaon kinda..
75,"Nov 24, 2021","Lycaon: Why'd you break the Throne?!Dokja: It was the trigger for the next scenario. It would have set off all five Catastrophes at once, and we would stood no chance. So I'm going to pick them off one at a time, while they're dormant, and permanently break the scenario. That's literally the only way to win: Ignore the enemy's rules, and do something they aren't prepared for.
Lycaon: 😳 🤯
Dokja: [You demonstrated Big Brain feats. Intelligence+💯] Huh. Neat."
75,"Nov 24, 2021",everyone simping for the wolf furry unit I guess
75,"Nov 24, 2021",That's wolf is hotter than most characters in this novel
75,"Nov 24, 2021",".....YO IM ATTRACTED TO A FUCKING WOLF- SLDKDKDKD

75,"Nov 24, 2021",Uh oh you made the furry mad...
75,"Nov 24, 2021","Lycaon welcome to our world. This is Dokja, if you haven't already figured it out he is going to piss you off, confuse you, and make things very very entertaining. Sir you are in for an adventure. 😂"
75,"Nov 24, 2021",My question is how are they completing  the sub-senario
75,"Nov 24, 2021",Wolf man go grrrrr
75,"Nov 24, 2021",Should have saved the moon stone for a Nidoking
75,"Nov 24, 2021",furry bait has appeared 
75,"Nov 24, 2021",is irritating people a skill of dokja’s? he seems pretty good at it. he must be at lvl 99999 already at pissing others. 
75,"Nov 24, 2021",This would have been a badass anime lol 🤣
75,"Nov 24, 2021",aw sweet a cool furry!
75,"Nov 24, 2021",When you tell the NPC that you've already completed the challenges and disabled all the traps 
75,"Nov 18, 2021",I think it’s safe to say we’ve reached the furry part of the story
75,"Nov 17, 2021",the theory that she is his mom gives me chills
75,"Nov 12, 2021",Dokja just spamming the skip button and freaking out Imyuntar.
75,"Nov 10, 2021","Dokja touched the moon stone. 
Wait… what’s happening..?
Dokja is evolving…
*Dokja spamming B*
Oh nothing happened."
75,"Oct 31, 2021",Dokja has the constellations all on his side now I love how he saw them floating around his head and immediately knew what he did 
75,"Oct 29, 2021",hehe i love how plagerizer(forgot her name) is looking for translation items while Dokja is pissing off the otherworlder he just meet
75,"Oct 22, 2021","I love Dokja's bargaining skills, like sir, come strategize a way outta my life too."
75,"Oct 21, 2021",acting level 4 huh?
75,"Oct 20, 2021",Hi Wolf Splinter Sensei.😁
75,"Oct 20, 2021","Man, I wish we got 2 or 3 chapters this week or something. WEBTOONS, do a bonus episode bonanza and I’ll buy every chapter at double the usual price. (Only for this series)"
75,"Oct 20, 2021",Dokja like trouble  and make a new enemy  piss him off 😅
75,"Oct 20, 2021",I'm more surprised at the fact that he's shocked about the constellations still and not the fact that he was able to awaken him a scenario earlier. But if Lycaon is this tanky how are the other guides? 
75,"Oct 20, 2021",does he still have to train if he altered the course of everything on his own? 
75,"Oct 20, 2021",The furries of Webtoon are quaking in their boots rn.
75,"Oct 20, 2021",Excuse me. Did I miss something? Since WHEN has Suyeong been able to access the Dokkaebi Shop? 
75,"Oct 20, 2021",Poor Lucan just realized there was a way to save his whole world after wasting the remainder of his life slave to the star stream services to live. 
75,"Oct 20, 2021",okay what is your problem now sir 
75,"Oct 20, 2021",he is so baffled lol

75,"Oct 20, 2021",Moms are always the greatest traumatizers...
75,"Nov 28, 2021","Uh, is it just me, or is wolfy really hot?"
75,"Nov 24, 2021","If lycan dangerous, why hot? "
75,5 days ago,Bruh Dokja prolly has the skill: “Piss Everyone Off At First Encounter” lol 
75,5 days ago,"Dokja, teach me that skill.I want to piss off many people."
75,6 days ago,i find it so goofy that suyeong has become dokjas trauma dumpster
75,"Oct 5, 2022",he looks very huggable. 
75,"Oct 1, 2022","It was super easy, barely an inconvenience!
NVM, it wasn't."
75,"Sep 30, 2022",lycaon is flabbergasted 
75,"Sep 26, 2022","Aww they have a baby now, but it’s already throwing an tantrum 👀"

75,"Sep 14, 2022","The king might be his mother, from his flashbacks, he seems to have some trauma concerning his family "

75,"Aug 4, 2022",The higher the episode the shorter the chapter 🥺
75,"Jul 22, 2022",dokja's mom i guess 
75,"Jul 17, 2022",A furry

75,"May 22, 2022",now that I stop to think about is the king of wanderers his mother? that would make sense with what he said so far about her and the trauma
75,"May 21, 2022",daddy? 
75,"May 17, 2022",Why is the first thought that came into my head when I saw lycaon-''Hot wolf man daddy.''

91,"Feb 9, 2022", Lol the Ichthyosaur is even showing a thumbs up when Kim Dokja is caught 😂
91,"Feb 9, 2022",YESSIRR DOKJA'S SECOND CHILDD LET'S GOOO
91,"Feb 9, 2022","""You know what to do, right?"" He might, but we the readers definitely don't."
91,"Feb 9, 2022",Dokja is telling Sangah about 'The World After the Fall' (the protag that uses only piercing skills). What a timing with TWATF manhwa's release the other day
91,"Feb 9, 2022","“You know what to do, right?”Yes. Adopt her immediately."
91,"Feb 9, 2022",she's just missing some quantum physics textbooks. 
91,"Feb 15, 2022",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' was glad to witness that there's still humility left to mankind.][5 coins have been sponsored.]//Happy birthday 🎂KDJ!!
91,"Feb 9, 2022","No I haven’t even read the full episode yet, I just came here to say how absolutely adorable the doodles are. "
91,"Feb 9, 2022","The fact that Han Sooyoung was so happy when someone arrived lmao, honestly, anyone would be happy in Sooyoung's situation since her pride was on the line. I DON'T WANT TO TARNISH MINE"
91,"Feb 9, 2022",Dokja on the path to be the greatest mom ever. 
91,"Feb 9, 2022",Oh damn this is about to hurt isn't it? Bad vibes with those faces😭I dont want the little girl to get hurt or be fake or some scenario or whatever😭
91,"Feb 9, 2022",The piercing attack that Kim Dokja and Yoo Sangah are talking about is a reference to Singshong's another novel called 'The World After The Fall'. The protagonist Jaehwan only focused on stabbing to grow stronger. People began calling him 'Jaehwan the Persistent Stabber' due to this. Please read it if you'd like :D
91,"Feb 14, 2022",Sangah: *Gives Food*  Dokja:*Gives food* Sooyoung:*Knife*
91,"Feb 9, 2022",Dokja you have too... ADOPT THE CHILD.
91,"Feb 14, 2022",Is it just me or it smells like KIM DOKJA IS ADOPTING ANOTHER CHILD? 
91,"Feb 9, 2022",SHE'S FINALLY HERE! ❤️
91,"Feb 9, 2022",Dokja's so pretty
91,"Feb 9, 2022","My first impression of the child was that she might be a prophet or somethomg. My second impression was that she might be Gilyeoung's sister. At the end... I have no goddamn clue what to think, but I am scared for the child's safety."
91,"Feb 9, 2022",Reading these chapters every week is so fun. They’re like my own little slices of happiness. 
91,"Feb 10, 2022",I wont spoil anything but that lil girl is one of my favorite characters in the LN
91,"Feb 9, 2022",Doodle Kim Dokja is soo cute 😂
91,"Mar 16, 2022","Gotta love the fans here. Everyone's excited but no one's saying why, lol. way to keep things spoil free!"
91,"Feb 9, 2022",Dokja gonna have two kids now lmao 
91,"Feb 9, 2022",She must also be a prodigy like gilyeong. 
91,"Feb 9, 2022",Dokja! You know what to do! *adopts another child*
91,"Mar 16, 2022","3 meals a day is required and they didn’t come back for another meal, 6hrs of sleep is required a day yet they are up so late, 500 coins per night yet a child somehow made that much. In conclusion sus"
91,"Feb 9, 2022",Dokja clearly knows what’s going on. 
91,"Mar 16, 2022",Sangah is probably one of my favorites in this story. I really love her (and appreciate that her and Han Sooyoung's rivalry has nothing to do with Dokja/a male character).
91,"Mar 16, 2022","""I could kill them all if i wanted to."" damn, sangah really strike with that line, love her ❤"
91,"Mar 16, 2022",and dokja once again has adopted another child. Apocalypse Korea's #1 Dad
91,"Mar 16, 2022","I never thought SY would be blonde though… I always pictured her as having brownish / black hair. Like a bit lighter than Gilyoung. But seriously, our little girl is finally here!! Squee!!"
91,"Feb 11, 2022",cant wait to see gilyoung again 😭
91,"Feb 10, 2022",Dokja: Look Gilyoung I found you a new friend!!!
91,"Mar 16, 2022",Dokja single dad arc LET'S GO!!
91,"Mar 16, 2022","Let me guess, that child is like some kind of disaster.  "
91,"Feb 9, 2022",I'm guessing she's a character in TWSA and that's why they both know her...
91,"Feb 11, 2022",😂 suyeong is so funny .... Dokja and suyeong can be bff's lol ..
91,"Feb 9, 2022",out of topic from this episode but i wonder if orv will have over 500 episodes too just like the novel. I'd be happy if they'll do that even it'll take years I'll wait👀
91,"Mar 16, 2022",child+later stages of apocalypse all alone =sus
91,"Feb 15, 2022",2nd homicidal child.
91,"Feb 9, 2022",Yoo Sangah is a goddess. Amen 🛐
91,"Mar 16, 2022",Sangah and Soyoung turning into Dokja's shoulder angel and devil.
91,"Feb 11, 2022",[A few people have become fond of you dokja] : that definitely includes me!🤚
91,"Feb 9, 2022","Dokja giving food to earn karma points for his talent, maybe?"
91,"Mar 16, 2022","Btw Sangah is still the MVP! She a good person, she deserves all the best! She's a queen, a goddess!"
91,"Mar 16, 2022",Unusual hair color= one of side characters ezzzz
91,"Mar 16, 2022",it's all nice and cute untill u remember all the requirements to live this long takes some serious effort and death. so that child is no weakling take gilyeong for example.
91,"Mar 16, 2022","""I can kill them all if I want to."" Omg, Sangah..."
91,"Mar 16, 2022",her knives are rated E for Everyone 
91,"Mar 16, 2022","Nice Easter egg thronw in there for the authors new show, the world after the fall hehe, just stabbed there in the conversation :D"
91,"Mar 17, 2022",Oh she is definitely a calamity. She was “dropped off” !!!!!!
91,"Mar 16, 2022",I miss Gilyeong!!!!! 😭😭😭
91,"Mar 16, 2022","gilyoung will have a sister now, and dokja will have another child 🥰"
91,"Mar 17, 2022","fck, here comes my favorite and also my most hated arc in the novel."
91,"Mar 16, 2022",DOKJA IS SO PRETTY LOOK AT HIM I LOVE HE DROOL
91,"Aug 12, 2022",“Protagonist only uses piercing attacks” - was that a reference to “the world after the fall”? :D
91,"Mar 16, 2022","Aha! Reference of ""the world after the fall"", the guy only doez piercing attack :D"
91,"Mar 16, 2022",She's here. Kim Dokja's second child. Can't wait to see the kids fighting over Kim Dokja's attention and affection lmao 😂 
91,"Feb 11, 2022",we see the little girl on episode 0 so I think she is good
91,"Feb 10, 2022",AAAHH IT'S HER!!! I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG TO SEE HOW THEY'D DRAW HER!!! 
91,"Aug 12, 2022",DID DOKJA EXPLAIN The World After The Fall TO THAT PERSON..... sus
91,"Mar 17, 2022",Looks like the two of them know whats up. Maybe something related to the original story.
91,"Mar 17, 2022",omg it's Dokja's second (adopted) child!! 
91,"Feb 12, 2022",SHIN YOOSUNG BABEY UR AS ADORABLE AS EVER😢💕 omgimgonnacryshessocute--
91,"Feb 9, 2022",i thought yoosung was black haired or smth lsjdjajsjjs but she's adorable 😍
91,"Feb 9, 2022",Kind of sad we got spoiled by chapter 0 🥴 (the girl stays in the group)
91,"Mar 16, 2022","I'm also a novel reader but it'd be nice if novel readers stop spoiling!!! even if it's minor it could be part of the suspense or build up that adds a lot to the story. I think it's more fun to let readersdiscover the story and make theories, even if they may be wrong."
91,"Aug 1, 2022",is that a 'the world after the fall' reference?
91,"May 9, 2022",#the character only uses piercing attacks 💀 the author gave us a hint of the webtoon (the world after the fall)...cheeky 😂
91,"Mar 21, 2022","I just think it’s unfair how I, as a woman, am called crazy, delusional, superficial and shallow when I show that I'm obsessed with Yoo Jonghyuk and spend all my life thinking about him and loving him but when a man does it, he's called Kim Dokja."
91,"Mar 17, 2022",I binge read this in 2 days. I may have neglected work a bit. hehe also that child is sus as f...
91,"Mar 17, 2022",How come that little girl survived in prologue of TWSA🤔
91,"Mar 17, 2022","The food, omg I still can’t get over imagining eating it and feeling the flavor melt in my mouth😩"
91,"Mar 17, 2022",IVE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS MOMENT 
91,"Mar 17, 2022",I admit it really is suspicious for a child to survive supposedly all alone
91,"Mar 9, 2022",Me: uses fastpass with free coinsAlso me: Now I have to wait another two weeks🥲
91,"Aug 30, 2022",Dokja:* and in that novel the protagonist  uses only piercing attacks* that WORLD AFTER THE FALL reference there 👀👀👌🏻
91,"May 24, 2022",Just realized they made a reference to The World After the Fall in this chapter.
91,"May 10, 2022",It's really sad to read this again after reading the novel. (I read the novel last year) It's good to see the characters and how the story is progressing. 
91,"Mar 23, 2022",The fact that she just dodged that doesn't mean she's a child. I'm guessing she's something else. 
91,"Mar 22, 2022",Omg I love this series so dang much I think this is my favorite series in all of WEBTOON please don’t ever stop making more episodes
91,"Mar 21, 2022",Yk what author-nim I have to wait 2 days to see the next ep but I'm dying of curiosity about the child now only. Still I wish you best luck for your story's upcoming episodes and I'm sure this one is gonna be great. I would also wait for some scenes with dokja and jungheoyk (I don't remember the name) also I'm missing the other supporting characters. Hope they come back soon
91,"Mar 19, 2022","Shangah ""i choose to be kind but i could also kill all of you in an instant"" my beloved"
91,"Mar 17, 2022","""You know what to do right?""   Dokja:  ""I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it."""
91,"Mar 17, 2022",SYS SO ADORABLEEE
91,"Mar 17, 2022","I mean, yes she's suspicious, but are you sure you want to anger Sangah like this? I would be peeing my pants if she looked at me like that. "
91,"Mar 17, 2022",Yup I knew it!!! when he told the little girl nvm he was afraid of sooyoung noticing her. I wonder what this means and is sangah gonna get in the way or not
91,"Mar 16, 2022",Seems the girl let herself slip up wonder what they found out
91,"Mar 16, 2022",[Constellation Stormy Ram King chuckled at the thought of Dokja adopting another child]
91,"Mar 16, 2022",NOOO I STG THIS IS HOW THEY HAVE TO STOP THE CATASTROPHE IN THE CENTER BY KILLING A CHILD
91,"Mar 16, 2022",she survived by herself and she has blankets to give? way too suspicious
91,"Mar 16, 2022",Thought I could hold out on not fast passing this WEBTOON. It’s been hard but I managed. Until today. I’ve failed
91,"Mar 16, 2022",Bahat!
91,"Mar 16, 2022","Quick Dokja, read the child!"
91,"Mar 16, 2022","am i thinking too much on this or did anyone else also have the same idea? in the “two hours later” panel dokja is talking to sangha about how “a protagonist” and they only use “piercing attacks” which i remember really clearly that in SAO, there was a scene where the author describes how Asuna only uses piercing attacks, since she specialized in rapiers. and with sangha resembling some qualities ok Asuna idk i’m just in a random rant please excuse me"
91,"Mar 16, 2022",this sub-scenario stresses me out cuz I wouldn't pass it on a normal day. I eat 1-2 meals a day and some days get 5hr of sleep xD
91,"Mar 16, 2022",HELP WHERE CAN I READ THE NOVEL?? 
91,"Mar 16, 2022","SHIN YOOSUNG, MY BABY, IS FINALLY HERE!!!!!!!!"
91,"Feb 9, 2022",watch her be a demon or zombie or smth like fr bro i thought she was nice smh
91,"Mar 16, 2022",congrats to kdj for just becoming a father of 2🤞💯
91,"Sep 9, 2022","""and the protagonist only uses piercing attacks"" yes yes I know that comic it's so good it called the world after the fall"
91,"Jul 2, 2022","Sangah is basically a Chaotic Good and Lawful Good at the same time. Dokja is a Lawful Neutral. And Han is like a Lawful Evil I suppose, though this can vary."
91,"Jun 10, 2022",I think i know the novel where the main character only use piercing move:) 
91,"Jun 4, 2022","was Dokja talking about ""The World After The End""?i mean, this manhwa's protagonist also uses only piercing attacks "
91,"May 25, 2022",Anyone catch the world after the fall reference? 😏
91,"May 3, 2022",I love the reference to the authors other novel “the world after the fall” when dokja said and the protagonist only uses piercing attacks 
91,"Apr 30, 2022","did he just allude to ""The World After The Fall""??? around the campfire toward sangah"
91,"Mar 31, 2022",Dokja telling sangha about the world after the fall 🧐
91,"Mar 29, 2022",Ayoo dokja just said someone in the novel only used thrust is that the world after the end mc?
91,"Mar 23, 2022","Sooyoung would get along with Michael Jordan with that ""f*ck them kids"" attitude"
91,"Mar 23, 2022","hi yoosung sweetheart, you're so pretty omg"
91,"Mar 23, 2022",man that knife throw was literally perfect. if I I that I would've somehow kill everyone I didn't want to and myself and leave the girl still alive! that's just my luck
91,"Mar 23, 2022",Question???? How do you say dokja ?? Is it doke ja? Or do ka or am I just completly wrong? I’m guessing it’s just like doka
91,"Mar 22, 2022",Gulp intensely*
91,"Mar 22, 2022",Would that food taste like vegetables or meat... Cause technically it's a plant but it definitely looks like meat
91,"Mar 21, 2022",what
91,"Mar 21, 2022",Day 90 of voicing all the characters
91,"Mar 21, 2022",let's go!!!!! The disaster of floods is about to be drawn in manhua style🤩
91,"Mar 20, 2022",hmmm that child kinda sus
91,"Mar 20, 2022",Ahhh we're finally at this part :DD
91,"Mar 20, 2022",*sips tea* interesting
91,"Mar 20, 2022",Sooyoung is hilarious! I love her character…brings comedic relief but she’s also very smart and calculative
91,"Mar 19, 2022","No wonder those Greek god (Olympos) chose Sangah as the one to stop the destruction since she always kind and helpful. Which, only exist in some kind of novel. Like a kind and helpful female protagonist."
91,"Mar 19, 2022",Imagine if this series hits 3000 episodes 
91,"Mar 17, 2022","Joongdok, Please grant me strength."
91,"Mar 17, 2022",oh yeah we finally reached the part till where I read the novel
91,"Mar 17, 2022",Please continue with what you are doing. Don't mind me as I stare. https://twitter.com/xiro_k/status/1504133993876590592?t=VCAOm5bGmrBFBUsl7okumQ&s=19
91,"Mar 17, 2022","Cynical as she is... She's 100% right to be wary here. With all the shit they've seen so far, it's not outside of the realm of reason for a small child like that to be a diversion."
91,"Mar 17, 2022","Since everybody is saying ""Happy Birthday"", Happy Birthday to me."
91,"Mar 17, 2022",just start reading earlier afternoon and now I reached the end...Welp time to wait
91,"Mar 17, 2022","So grateful for this manhwa, ugh. Feel like the Holy Trio are friends I've made in real life. I used to read the actual novel on the subway a couple of years ago so UGH, it hits. I LOVE U UGLY RAT MAN AND REGRESSO DEPRESSO SUNFISH BASTARD AND EVERYONE ELSE."
91,"Mar 16, 2022",Gee...I hope Sangha doesn't become a love interest of Dokja's.
91,"Mar 16, 2022",I AM BACK FROM THE DEAD..APPARENTLY.
91,"Mar 16, 2022",YOOSUNG YOU ARE SO CUTE😭
91,"Mar 16, 2022",what!!!! what does he have to do????? 😭 do not hurt cinnamon roll! she gave you blankets!

91,"Mar 16, 2022",WHY IS SHE BLONDE😰😰
91,"Mar 16, 2022",who is this girl
91,"Mar 16, 2022",HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY KIM DOKJA 🎉🎉❤️
91,"Mar 16, 2022",oh come oon... what a cliffhanger! Why? What does she means? What is what Dokja found out?
91,"Mar 16, 2022","I know there is likely trickery involved her with the little girl. But I want it to not be so, so I can laugh over her paranoia"
91,"Mar 16, 2022","Not what I imagined she would look like, can’t wait for next chapter"
91,"Mar 16, 2022",MIB theory: A kid alone at night in a dangerous place is sus.
91,"Mar 16, 2022",I don't know who you are yet but join the party jointheparty JOINTHEPARTY
91,"Mar 16, 2022","did anyone else realize while Dokja was talking about a protagonist who only uses piercing attacks is a reference to ""The World After the Fall"". Another manhwa/light novel by the same author."
91,"Mar 16, 2022",SHE!!!!! HAS APPEARED!!!!!!!!!!!!
91,"Mar 16, 2022",All I want to do is buy coins and fast pass... but I'm broke
91,"Mar 16, 2022",i love how a lot of people reading this for the first time would hate hsy but everyone just collectively understands
91,"Mar 16, 2022","BELATED HAPPY BIRTHDAY KIM DOKJA! IT'S ONLY ONE MONTH LATE, NO WORRIES AT ALL."
91,"Mar 16, 2022",no I didn't wish him. happy birthday 😭 happy late birthday 🥲
91,"Mar 16, 2022",Ok im happy there is another child but like... a 10-12 y/o kid surviving by themselves in an apocalypse without any guardian is pretty sus but at the same time come to think of it Gilyoung can also probably survive without anyone like he's pretty smart and powerful so
91,"Mar 16, 2022",They know something we don't.....
91,"Mar 16, 2022",WHAT'S HAPPENING??? IS SHE ANOTHER CATASTROPHE?
91,"Mar 16, 2022","I'm scrolling through the comments looking for spoilers coz I'm the weirdo that likes spoilers. So anyone who knows, pls reply to my comment here. And anyone who doesn't wanna know pls don't open my replies. "
91,"Mar 16, 2022",ahhh the best child is finally appearing... All hail dokja's child!
91,"Mar 16, 2022",Aren't they supposed to die if they don't eat three meals a day because of the scenario? How can they be starving? Well I guess it depends on what's considered a meal. If a grain of rice is enough for the scenario they can survive while starving. 
91,"Mar 16, 2022",Favorite part in the whole series is seeing the sea dragon doodle with a thumbs up as Dokja is being eaten 🐉🤣
91,"Mar 16, 2022",'The protagonist in the novel only uses piercing attacks'?? Yo!! The author just promoted his other book. Did anyone notice? Dokja even made a cameo in that book.
91,"Mar 16, 2022",happy birthday to Dokja 🎉🎉🎉!! What's the deal with the kid and wdym Dokja knows what to do 🧐? Thanks for the amazing episode authors and translator-nim 💫💫🎂🎉🎊
91,"Mar 16, 2022","so the ""easy way"" to beat the center catastrophe must involve this kid. Dokja knows, but didn't say anything because he doesn't want to do it."
91,"Mar 13, 2022",Second Child has arrived 😍 😂😂Whenever there was an conversation between dokja and Sangha that time it was in serious mood ..when sooyoung enters the conversation it becomes too funny 😆 😄 🤣 
91,"Feb 27, 2022",I’m out of coins now I can’t buy the next episode   :(
91,"Feb 17, 2022",Oooo I like the world before the fall reference😁 if you guys have the chance definitely read that one also it was the authors first book/the one before ORV I believe
91,"Feb 9, 2022","Hmmm I knew something was up, I wonder if she is apart of the scenario or a sub quest/bonus objective?"
91,"Feb 9, 2022",spoiler spoiler go away 🙌
91,"Feb 9, 2022",damnn woman are scary. that kid looks adorable yet suspicious
91,"Feb 9, 2022",That crazed looked she gave when the kid arrived 😅
91,"Feb 9, 2022","My, that's peak art at the beginning. The artists need a raise!! 😤"
91,"Feb 9, 2022",The company is starting!!! 
91,"Feb 9, 2022","Finally!!! Shin Yoosung, my beloved 😭❤️"
91,"Mar 17, 2022",I'm not even crying. This is so bad. I can't even cry about it. I think I might just laugh.
91,"Mar 17, 2022",why did you make sangah a killer.
91,"Mar 17, 2022",Even in this situation I want dokja and suyeong to be a thing lol btw Happy birthday kim dokja!! And dont believe soo much in a kiddo who's alone in the dark who survived by themselves during an apocalypse 
91,"Sep 20, 2022",dokja is starting a daycare isnt he
91,"Sep 13, 2022",Dokja talking about our authors newest Manwha!!!xD
91,"Aug 20, 2022","Anyone else noticed the ""The World After The Fall"" hint between Dokja and Sangah? 'The protagonist in the novel only uses stab attacks' 🔪 Keep up the good work! 😃"
91,"Aug 6, 2022",Dokja and Joonghyuks second child has arrived 😁
91,"Jul 6, 2022",I only have two words to say . ADOPT HER .
91,"Jun 7, 2022",world after the fall reference!
91,"Jun 6, 2022",“And the protagonist only uses piercing attacks” author we’re you referencing your other WEBTOON in this scene? 
91,"Jun 1, 2022","dang talking about another novel dokja, I bet people know who that protagonist who only uses piercing attacks is hmm."
91,"May 25, 2022",did yall notice the reference to the authors current webtoon???🤣
91,"May 9, 2022","wait when he was talking about the novel that only uses piercing attacks could that be ""the world after the fall""? another story by singsong which is reslly good"
91,"Apr 24, 2022",HSY : You know what to do right?KDJ : ...Yes. Where are the adoption papers?
91,"Apr 20, 2022","Kim dokja you know what to do, *proceeds to adopt another child*"
91,"Apr 16, 2022","""They're starving"" genuinely hurt so much. Idek why. it makes it so much more impactful coming from the sangah now. "
91,"Apr 1, 2022","My favorite line of Sangah. “I could kill them all if I wanted to. Therefore, I could save them all as well.”"
91,"Mar 31, 2022","""The protagonist who just uses piercing attacks"" is from The World After The Fall, right?I'm not sure if the manwha had already started when this chapter first came out, but it is an interesting one!"
91,"Mar 29, 2022",a child? survived? in an apocalypse? 
91,"Mar 28, 2022",It’s amusing that I don’t see much comments about Sangah. she definitely has a character growth and finally learned to speak up more! Proud of her!
91,"Mar 27, 2022",i know she's super sus. BUT SHES CUTE AND SHE CAN BE GIL'S FRIEND
91,"Mar 24, 2022",dokja and his ever growing dependents 
91,"Mar 23, 2022",[An unknown constellation smiles benevolently] 
91,"Mar 23, 2022","My baaaaaabyyy, she's HEEEEREEEEE"
91,"Mar 22, 2022",I wonder if the reason why Dokja didn't question the child further about her parents/where she's from is because that might've broken the rule of plausability
91,"Mar 21, 2022","[The Constellation Great Seal Of Nyx Is Impressed By Your Suspicions] [2,500 Coins Have Been Sponsored]"
91,"Mar 21, 2022",OH DAMNNN WHAT'D THE KID DO

P.s. I really like your comic and I can’t wait for the next one

91,"Feb 10, 2022",A cute girl that doesn't look like a generic character. She's either a new ally or a sus.
91,"Feb 10, 2022",I screamed when the Episode ended... Damn cliffhanger! 😆
91,"Feb 9, 2022",Ahh I'm kinda wondering what he's gonna do with the kid
91,"Feb 9, 2022",You know something big is about to go down when characters start getting comfy 
91,"Feb 9, 2022",this was sooooo short
91,"Feb 9, 2022","Tf? No, I don’t think he DOES know “what to do.” I sure don’t. I’d tackle her and help the kid. Assuming it’s actually a kid… but presumably his Character Profile thing could tell him? Recruit the kid if a kid, kill if not, I suppose. It’s likely something bad like how “hero” Returnees are actually bad."
91,"Feb 9, 2022",ummm 🤔 what is Dokja supposed to do? Take care of her I hope 🙏 don't break my heart little girl please
91,"Feb 9, 2022",That cliffhanger 🥲
91,"Feb 9, 2022",Dokja just had an MIB momentIn what way has this kid survived this whole time? 
91,"Feb 9, 2022",any time a kid has survived in an apocalypse it's always due to either some outside force or they are more dangerous than anything else you've seen
91,"Feb 9, 2022",I don't know who the girl is but she will definitely be important or at least make things interesting. 
91,"Feb 9, 2022",this child is going to secretly be God or something isn't she?
91,"Feb 9, 2022","Well, the girl IS suspicious at this point, there's definitely something more to her"
91,"Feb 9, 2022","My, Han Sooyoung caught to what Dokja was thinking, hmm"
91,"Feb 9, 2022",The child of apocalypse... can't wwit to see how strong she is
91,"Mar 16, 2022",I love that they used some sort of concept art to draw Dokja's thoughts. Speeds up the art process and the weekly process
91,5 days ago,"i noticed that reference you made to ""the world after the fall"" and I love it"
91,"Oct 10, 2022",dokjas and jungyeooks new child ( not sure if i spelled his name right)
91,"Oct 3, 2022",They were talking about the world after the fall when Dokja said a a guy who only uses piercing attacks
91,"Sep 30, 2022","Kim dokaja toking about ""the world after the fall"" this one has manwha too."
91,"Aug 19, 2022",Holy shit I’m just realizing this chapter hints at The World After the Fall by the same author. The “only uses piercing attacks” bit. 
91,"Aug 17, 2022","omgg i think i should pick up ""the world after fall"" thanks to the comments "
91,"Aug 9, 2022",starting to think sangah is the main character of this novel lol
91,"Aug 6, 2022",90
91,"Jul 28, 2022","I was re-reading this chapter and found out that Dokja mentioned about the author's new webtoon ""The world after the fall"" before it's publishing o.o"
91,"Jul 19, 2022",The Constellation that just gifted them coins clearly wants them to adopt yet another wayward orphan.
91,"Jul 13, 2022",Protagonist that only stabs somewhere I heard this but where? 
91,"Jul 11, 2022",sooyoung trust issues
91,"Jul 7, 2022",Happy Birthday Dokja 🎂  l love you so much  man
91,"Jul 5, 2022",remember when Ichthyosaur was a terrible monster in which Dokja spent a considerable amount of days? yeah long gone somehow
91,"Jun 23, 2022",[The Constellation 'Unproductive Reader' is welcoming the disaster of floods]
91,"Jun 20, 2022",I GET THAT REFERENCE😆😆😆 (he said this one protagonist uses only piercing attacks)
91,"Jun 15, 2022",You give out food because you're a good person. I give out food because I like money. We are not the same.
91,"Jun 15, 2022",moment you came here from the world after the fall and see the part about the character only using piercing attacks haha
91,"Jun 14, 2022",it only took me a second to realize the world after fall reference.
91,"Jun 10, 2022",Dokja literally said she reminds him of gilyeong. Gilyeong is like a son to him. Dokja won’t do anything too drastic I’m sure of that
91,"Jun 10, 2022",Early world after the fall reference nice!
91,"May 22, 2022","was that... a *The World After the Fall* reference? xD love that the author seeds references to his own works like that. it's a great webtoon so far, too!"
91,"May 14, 2022",At first I thought the child was good now I’m not so sure
91,"May 9, 2022",I love the The Word After The Fall Easter egg hehe 
91,"May 1, 2022",loved the casual reference to the world after the fall ^^
91,"Apr 26, 2022",Ah yes I remember this from the novel 👀👀🍷 
91,"Apr 21, 2022","Damn is no one going to mention the completely terrifying look Sangah had? This artist is so skillful, that sent shivers down my spine. And then to think she is choosing to be compassionate anyways 😭😭♥️"
91,"Apr 9, 2022",The duality of Sangah. She's still willing to help out people but isn't afraid of it coming back to bite her or the betrayal cuz she can kill them all. That's what some might call power. Suyeong is adorable af. The little dork got all excited when she thought wanderers we're coming to attack then 😂 I wonder what's up with the little girl. Dokja didn't say anything cuz he knew Suyeong would also catch on. 🤔
91,"Apr 6, 2022","opxxx I'm late, belated happy birthday my beloved man dokja kim, love u"
91,"Apr 6, 2022","Is she sponsored by Demonic Judge, or is she the catastrophe?"
91,"Apr 6, 2022",WHY IS IT ALWSY THE KIDS 😕
91,"Apr 6, 2022",She’s so adorable but something suspicious can be up with her🤧
91,"Apr 4, 2022",im cryinfg sooyoung was so happy someone came LOL

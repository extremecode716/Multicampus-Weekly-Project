31,"Dec 2, 2020","In the end, Gilyeong is truly one of the ones that has adapted the fastest to their new world. Understanding that if they want to survive, something has to be sacrificed, whether its another life or the easy route. "
31,"Dec 2, 2020","Soooo, dokjas little party consists of, A military himbo, a stong-headed swords woman, a portable translator, and pet smart?"
31,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja just be staring at his phone while peeps be killing each other. This reader is on a whole nother level of being nonchalant
31,"Dec 2, 2020",Gilyeong must really trust Dokja cause i mean the kid was prepared to go into battle lol. But i concerned how he look so innocent and can  say something so terrifying at the same time lol.
31,"Dec 2, 2020","I'm imagining ""ok I will always remember you"" as he runs in the opposite direction."
31,"Dec 2, 2020","""I would have respected your choice no matter what you choose"" - Dokja 2020It's something that everyone should learn this year. "
31,"Dec 2, 2020",I love when Dokja always have his hand on the head of Gilyeong. I can tell he reassures him that everything will be alright it‚Äôs really cute too 
31,"Jan 20, 2021","the adults are all ""I refuse to kill"" and the kid is like ""murder lol"""
31,"Dec 2, 2020",I love Dokja's method of presenting options to his party
31,"Jan 20, 2021",Everyone else:ü§∫üèåüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§ºüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Kim Dokja: üòóü§≥
31,"Dec 2, 2020","Constellation ""Herald of the Black Dawn"" looks into her wallet and sighs as she tosses in her last five coins. "
31,"Dec 2, 2020",I love that he pointed out that he didn't care what side he chose. 
31,"Dec 2, 2020",This far into a fast pass I don‚Äôt think anyone is going to try and wait  we either buy more coins or we wait 2 months.
31,"Dec 27, 2020",‚ö†Ô∏èSpoiler‚ö†Ô∏è not really spoiler but...The one true ship is dokja and him always lying about having two options 
31,"Dec 2, 2020",Ah yes running headfirst into danger is always the safest option!
31,"Dec 2, 2020",If they can get behind the spawn point maybe the monsters won‚Äôt be able to see them
31,"Dec 2, 2020",So fun how the constellations see Dokja procrastinate while the party works for him.
31,"Dec 2, 2020",hands up for those who read the novel üôå

31,"Dec 2, 2020",Shaman boy Is a Ride or die I like him
31,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja is becoming my favorite character with every new episode
31,"Dec 2, 2020",Every time I think I have an idea whats going on I just get more impressed. I can't wait to see how a direct rush is gonna pay off.
31,"Dec 2, 2020",Dokja: Run towards them!Me: I think the f*ck not! First option please!
31,"Dec 2, 2020",So predictions: 1. They are ‚Äúfake‚Äù and can just run right through them. 2. There is a place after them and they have to get past them. And 3. They ride one and wait for them to eventually kill a player in a green zone. (This can cancel out if they are the ‚Äúdeath‚Äù part)
31,"Dec 2, 2020",Ahh the character development. Dokja you demon üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è makes me wanna go back and reread the whole story
31,"Dec 2, 2020",[The Ever Spending Constellation] is sad to see this cliffhanger +5 coins
31,"Dec 2, 2020","If you actually have all the episodes done, I think quite a few of us will be willing to stupidly drop $100+ to finish this the series lol"
31,"Jan 20, 2021",Man the adults are oh no I can't kill someone meanwhile the CHILD ight let's kill em
31,"Dec 2, 2020","My baby boy was like ""nah fam, let me handle this weak punks"" ü•∫ Gilyeong is so precious and terrifying at the same time. I'm glad he is making it this far."
31,"Jan 20, 2021",imagine having to kill people to just barely get into green zone to stay alive but then you see a bunch of these feckers run straight into enemy and survive 
31,"Jan 20, 2021","I find it hilarious how people were saying ""protect the kid!"" at the beginning, and now everyone is like ""WAIT GILYOUNG WANTS TO KILL PEOPLE"""
31,"Jan 20, 2021",dokja: ok so we have 2 options‚Äúthat many?‚Äù LOL
31,"Dec 2, 2020",Ngl that kid got some balls respect
31,"Jan 21, 2021","i like how the author potrays dokja. he's neither good or bad. in apocalypse, you cant expect people gonna be nice all the time. you have to be selfish to protect yourself."
31,"Jan 20, 2021",I miss Ji-hye calling Dokja Ahjussi
31,"Jan 21, 2021",The adults: ‚Ä¢scared millennial noises‚Ä¢ The kid: ‚Ä¢bored gen z noises‚Ä¢
31,"Jan 20, 2021","*Dokja telling everyone that they would have to kill for a room* *Adults looking horrified*
Gilyeong: Oh say less üòè"
31,"Jan 20, 2021",Dokja pls adopt Gilyeoung üòäthey‚Äôre so adorable together 
31,"Jan 21, 2021",Gilyeong is so ride or die. Little man rlly said say the word.
31,"Jan 20, 2021",nothing beats gilyoung‚Äôs willingness for murder man i love this kid and the minor concern he causes dokja
31,"Jan 20, 2021",Like honestly?? I just want dokja‚Äôs phone battery ü§£ü§£
31,"Jan 20, 2021","as a reader of the novel, I'm really enjoying these predictions"
31,"Jan 20, 2021","people who've read the novel,  try to refrain from ruining/spoiling it for the rest.  thx"
31,"Dec 3, 2020",i love how gilyeong is just ready to do whatever dokja says... it really puts it into perspective how much he actually truly trusts dokja to make the right decision to keep him alive
31,"Dec 2, 2020",I love how dokkaebi cant even read a txt message üòÇ
31,"Jan 20, 2021","Dokja sitting on his phone while surrounded by murder in the apocalypse is the epitome of ""No thoughts head empty"""
31,"Dec 16, 2020",I see Gilyeong is the ride or die
31,"Jan 23, 2021","for my ""novel-reader"" comrades, please don't spoil the future for the kids here even if they guess it correctly. play along with them as the probability of their enjoyment may never be breached. "
31,"Jan 22, 2021","I know many people get ‚Äúbored‚Äù of the whole ‚Äúmain characters have to take the moral route‚Äù trope. But personally, I love how this story wrestles with the decisions. Just because you killed someone once doesn‚Äôt make you an outright monster. When you choose to lose your conscience and disregard the sanctity of life and other‚Äôs sovereignty and independence‚Äîthat‚Äôs when you become a monster. We can‚Äôt afford to lose all sense of justice and morality simply because thinking about it is difficult. "
31,"Jan 21, 2021","I love how the kid is all like ""I'll do it if you're willing to..."" and 3 grown ups are like üò± Talkin' about iniciative XD "
31,"Jan 20, 2021","Man, ""reading"" it and ""seeing"" it are two whole different things. Its so cool to really see what it looks like."
31,"Jan 20, 2021",Junghyeok and Dokja had no right to look so attractive in this chapter
31,"Dec 2, 2020",I have to assume a green room spawns behind the monsters or perhaps they can't re enter their own spawn. or maybe splitting the monsters up so they don't work together is their strategy. keeping the kid with him means he may try and have him lure the one way with his communication while the other 3 take the rest. either way dokja is putting a lot of trust into his companions and I enjoy seeing everyone growth. Gilyeong willing to kill to survive if they must shows he trusts dokja with his life.
31,"Jan 21, 2021",The little man has more guts than most of the adults
31,"Jan 21, 2021","The face of Dokja when the cuddly-demon said ""You are boring the Constellations to death!"" Man, entertaiment's a b1tch... "
31,"Dec 2, 2020",I am soo freaking stucked in the fast pass scenario... I will have to pay till I die! and I will never regret it :3
31,"Dec 2, 2020",Boi I swear if you keep giving me these cliffhangers imma beat them all up
31,"May 1, 2021",Dokja is a true chaotic neutral
31,"Apr 30, 2021","""If your friend told you to jump off a building, would you do it?""""I dunno, is Dokja the friend?"""
31,"Jan 20, 2021","Gilyeong really said ""I'm down if your down""....little man what??"
31,"Jan 20, 2021","Sangah: ""Hey let me see what you have!"" Gilyeong, about to attack the people in a room: ""A knife!"" Sangah: ""NO"""
31,"Jan 21, 2021",Imagine them three die cause there was no plan then he says  ‚Äúgreat! We only need a room for us two now!‚Äù
31,"Jan 20, 2021","''its nothing personal, I just don't want to die."""
31,"Jan 24, 2021","I like how the three of them were horrified at the idea of killing people and Gilyoung was just like, ""I'm game"". "
31,"Jan 21, 2021",Kim Dokja: Option one is murder   Everyone: üò®üò∞   Gilyoung: I‚Äôm down if he‚Äôs down
31,"Jan 20, 2021",Every time Dokja gives a headpat to Gilyeong is my favorite time
31,"Jan 20, 2021","Gilyeong! my baby! my heart! I'm equal parts proud and devastated. I really want this group to stay as pure as possible in all of this. Eventually we're gonna lose one of them and I'm dreading that inevitability. Finally, the protagonist is fine AF. I say it every time he appears because it remains true. Junghyeok may be a lot of things  but ugly did not make the list."
31,"Dec 2, 2020","""when buff's up, we LEERROOOOOOYYY JEEEEENKIIIIINNSSSS"" "
31,"Jan 28, 2021","lil Gilyeong really said ""I don't mind killing"""
31,"Jan 25, 2021","Is anyone else mildly concerned that after we finish reading this webtoon, we'll be hurled into a sudden scenario?"
31,"Jan 21, 2021",I love how he treats him like he‚Äôs a big brother to him it‚Äôs just so cute seeing him pat his head.
31,"Jan 20, 2021",Dokja casually reading as chaos ensues around him is so hilarious hes just always calm and collected
31,"Jan 20, 2021",gulyeong is the most loyal trooper there is no question asked
31,"Dec 3, 2020","I don't want you to think I'm a bad person but it's very annoying that a lot of comments are just with ""I paid so much in this series"" or ""When you can't stop spending your money on webtoon"". I mean I have spent more than 100$ on webtoon. I have this app since 2016 and I don't write such comments. Every time I see a comment related to money and not to the chapter, I fell like I want to dislike every single one of them, but I don't. Please just don't do this anymore."
31,"May 16, 2021",Gil tends to scare the living daylights out of me more than anyone
31,"Apr 29, 2021","Aaaww even when Gilyeong is ready to kill somone, hes still so cuteüòäü•∫üíñüíñ"
31,"Apr 28, 2021",Dokja: I am not the good guy in this story...Also Dokja: *will constantly protect Gilyeong at all costs* 
31,"Apr 27, 2021",You can see how dokja is fond of gilyeong by how much he pats his head uwuü•∫
31,"Apr 27, 2021",can I adopt Gilyeong right now?
31,"Feb 23, 2021",i wanna mother gilyeong so much 
31,"Feb 1, 2021",the fact that the child would do anything as long as dokja approves is making me feel some type of way about their relationship..like this trust the child has in dokja is definitely going to give way to an interesting arc in future.
31,"Jan 24, 2021","this chapter shows how much they trust dokja, if dokja tells them to run towards the monster, they will run toward the monster, 'cause they know that Dokja knows what he's doing."
31,"Jan 24, 2021",dokja isn't like others survivor character that we reads in other webtoon. his mindset is so strong and make me wonder what he's going through in past. he's not hesitate and his action sometimes looks cruel yet he know what he's doing right away. 
31,"Jan 21, 2021",Dokja is acting like this is his first crazy idea... I‚Äôd be more surprised if it isn‚Äôt crazy üòÇ
31,"Jan 20, 2021",you know things are bad when the kid is ready to kill
31,"Jan 20, 2021","Gilyeong: ""Yes I did that. And you would do it too for a check. I was an employee! And I was going to get employee of the month, and that's on period!"""
31,"Dec 3, 2020",gilyeong is scary and adorable 
31,"Dec 2, 2020",the level of trust they have for him is staggering...
31,"Jan 21, 2021","Dokja- ""so we Could murder these people Or..."" Gilyeong- ""RIDE OR DIE BITCHES"" "
31,"Jan 20, 2021",Plot twist: the monsters are friendly and will shower them with coins and hug them
31,"Dec 6, 2020",The constellation [The Coinless Bargain] wishes to bargain for the next chapter. [The Coinless Bargain] is desperate to know what Dokja is thinking 
31,"Oct 22, 2021",Gilyeong: Yeah I'm down to kill a bitch
31,"Jul 26, 2021",It might sound awkward but what if gilyeong is the writer of the story and because of his trust in dokja and him being his hero is what made him right the story in future in way to make sure they dokja in the past is ready for the monsters and become awesome that he was when he first met him.I'm sure he is something Important and that's why dokja has an affection towards him
31,"Jul 8, 2021","I usually don't like stories like these because they usually end up saying ""x deserves to die"" but I like how these guys are taking the ""hypocritical"" path. also I noticed the people who are weaker end up hurting their own groups. but dokja's group is able to keep their sense of self and make quick tough decisions which I like. I believe in their strength!"
31,"May 11, 2021","I wonder, Do Dokja and Protagonist becomes good allies/friends? Or does Dokja never get any loyal allies or trusted friends? Cuz of his personality or other..? I mean the group he has now is cool. I like them, the kid and the woman with judgement skill the most and he cares about them a little, to a point, but not a lot. So I just want to know if he gains any really loyal or trustworthy ppl to.stick by his side long as they survive. I hope someone can answer this question "
31,"May 9, 2021","I have to say, I don‚Äôt usually read this style. I am much more into comedy and romance but this has me hooked so hard. The story is extremely well done. The art is amazing. I would love to see this turned into an animated series at the very least. "
31,"May 5, 2021",Lets be honest Gilyeong has more guts then us XD l
31,"Jan 24, 2021",Gilyeon is still a very impressionable kid. Kid's are like sponges when it comes to soaking up information around them. I'm glad he's surrounded by people who have his best interest in mind. They're in a difficult situation...it was nice to hear his choice will be respected but he's also being taught about less grim options. 
31,"Jan 21, 2021","Dokja: do you trust me?
Everone else: with every fiber of my being."
31,"Jan 21, 2021",[Trust LV. 1000]
31,"Jan 21, 2021",Hahahah love that little kid!! ü§£ü§£ü§£ he was ready to slay if Dokja wasüòÇ
31,"Jan 20, 2021",Is it just me or do these monsters look like the cuddly type?
31,"Sep 2, 2021",the way dokja is just sitting there reading novel casually while people kill each other and corpse are laying around.. üíÄ
31,"Aug 8, 2021",Dokja: we gotta-Gilyeong: I‚Äôll beat they ass right now say I wont
31,"Jul 29, 2021",Gilyeong is a king 
31,"Jun 25, 2021","Dokja stating the fact that he would have respected either decision while placing a hand on Gilyeong‚Äôs head is EVERYTHING to me. Of course I definitely don‚Äôt want them to kill people either, but not being placed in a high stakes situation I don‚Äôt feel I have the right to judge.  And importantly making Gilyeong not feel ashamed for his decision and singled out.  "
31,"May 6, 2021",[The Late Reader laughs and cries at what he thinks is stupidity]
31,"Apr 28, 2021","""im up for it as long your willing to do it"" I FUKING LOVE GILYEOUNG"
31,"Mar 31, 2021",okey but Dokja scrolling through his phone while people killing each other around him had me cackling so hard üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüëå
31,"Mar 4, 2021",That kid was totally ready to sacrifice the enemies lives to survive. BASED.
31,"Jan 26, 2021","You know, the web novel is so good. Keep reading! it will get better with each chapter. I can't wait‚ú®‚ú®"
31,"Jan 26, 2021",I just had the strangest feeling... like this whole comments section for the series is a social experiment... about how we react to and rationalize all the terrible things happening...
31,"Jan 25, 2021",Dokja when he was little: *hides from imaginary monsters* Dokja now: *tells friends to run at real ones* me: ...not what I was expecting but okay...
31,"Jan 25, 2021",****Illegal cliffhanger alert****
31,"Jan 24, 2021",holy cow there r so many spoilers in the comments. don't read the comments of u don't wanna get spoiled. like so others can see this.
31,"Jan 24, 2021",Gilyeong was like ‚ÄúWe ride at down‚Äù
31,"Jan 22, 2021",The constallation [Trashretire] is interested in what will happen next but will need to test their patience as they are broke.
31,"Jan 22, 2021","And that's, the moment he says: ""Sorry, I can only keep those willing to kill. Distract them well while I go look for a room with Gilyeong.""  Of course, that won't happen. "
31,"Jan 21, 2021",The comments section is always entertaining
31,"Jan 21, 2021","Dokja: ""we have two options"" ‚úåÔ∏è
 Huiwon: ""that many?"" (üòÇüòÇ) "
31,"Jan 21, 2021","ahhh it happened here the first time! dokja's famous ""two options"""
31,"Jan 21, 2021","Gilyeong really just said ""blood for the blood god"""
31,"Jan 21, 2021",he is a true reader people be killing each other abd he just be in the background don't mind me just readingüòÇüòÇ
31,"Jan 21, 2021","Plot twist, it was a test and Gilyeong is the only one who passed and gets to live."
31,"Jan 21, 2021",Dude I like the kid even more. you gotta be ready to do what it takes in this end of world scenario. it's good to keep your morals but it can get you killed
31,"Jan 20, 2021",i dont think i can handle anyone in this party dying
31,"Jan 20, 2021",Great chapter! Once again Dokja's knowing more than everyone else makes his character so fun to read. I'm so curious to see what his plan is here and how Junghyeok reacts to it. This series is so enjoyable!
31,"Jan 20, 2021",The guts Gilyeong is both amazing and terrifying. I can't wait to see how their characters will turn out!
31,"Jan 20, 2021",Gilyeong being ready to kill is kinda terrifying üò¨
31,"Dec 5, 2020","my guess is that dokja is gonna have gilyeong do his bug-summon-thingy and bring in some op monster to totally wreck shop. that's why dokja is carrying him in the last scene, bc gilyeong gets weak using that much of his strength"
31,"Dec 2, 2020",My little homie Gilyeong with the shits üòÜüòÜ YEAAH!!!! LETS GOOOI!!!
31,"Sep 11, 2021",This is such a ride or die squad üòÇ
31,"Aug 6, 2021",that kid is rly a ride or die for him
31,"May 2, 2021",gilyeong is not just smart but he's also brave... and sometimes he kind of scares me lol
31,"May 1, 2021",I've said this before but there's something off about Gilyeong
31,"May 1, 2021",Aww when she said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to become a monster‚Äù Dokja looked so proud of his crewü•≤
31,"Apr 27, 2021",Gilyeong and dokja are the cutest duo ever >< also can I adopt gilyeong please
31,"Apr 27, 2021","[the constalation of {Jericho} has offered up 5 coins to Gilyeong, may he prosper]"
31,"Apr 8, 2021","something I also appreciate in this story is how just because they already killed people once doesn't mean they'll suddenly be able to cold-heartedly do it again even if it's the easier option. heck, it's because it's an option among options that they didn't want to do it if they could afford to. even in the future chapters, they still know how to value life even after all they've been through."
31,"Apr 5, 2021","I‚Äôm just now realizing how cool of a character Dokja is!! Like hear me out: just because he had read TWSA and knew all the events doesn‚Äôt mean he was automatically going to be able to think clearly about what do and just act. In a traumatic experience such as the one that marked the beginning of the apocalypse, he could‚Äôve gone insane and just given up but he didn‚Äôt and know he‚Äôs like this new person ig??? Or more confident idkkkk"
31,"Mar 30, 2021","Even the kid is willing to take a life. he's adapting well for a kid his age, if i was him i'd most likely be dead already"
31,"Mar 25, 2021",It looks like an insane plan but i trust him :D
31,"Mar 9, 2021",gilyeong is my son. goodbye and thank you
31,"Feb 6, 2021",Also I absolutely die for how he said no matter what you chose I‚Äôd stand by you
31,"Feb 1, 2021","I LOVED the line ""i would have respected your choice..."" because it felt exactly the same as I feel when i read a book and start to like a character.. He is really acting like a reader but I hope this ""distance"" won't bring him to do something that Dokja or us will regret.. I am so hyped to continue ahahaha"
31,"Jan 31, 2021",Dokja is chilling reading his phone while people are murdering and dying around him üòÖ
31,"Jan 26, 2021",‚ÄúWe now have 2 options‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúThAt mANy?!‚Äù
31,"Jan 22, 2021",Gilyeong and Dokja have like a {Father& Son} or [Older Brother & Younger Brother] connection ‚ô°
31,"Jan 22, 2021",I'm glad Sangah had the smarts to actually ask what the options WERE.
31,"Jan 21, 2021",I LITERALLY WOULD SACRIFICE MYSELF FOR GILYEONG. SON YOU PRECIOUS BEAN I'LL MAKE SURE YOU WILL SURVIVE üò≠
31,"Jan 21, 2021",Please.. a tear leaves my eyes every time Gilyeong gets a head rub 
31,"Jan 21, 2021",Dokja saying he would have respected Gilyeong's choice and the comment that he might have the worst trauma? empathy here!
31,"Jan 21, 2021",Dokja asked a question I want to know exactly how powerful is the writer of twsa 
31,"Jan 21, 2021","i like how calm he is even if u know whats gonna happen it's still scarry to live it , i can't wait to the next episode"
31,"Jan 21, 2021",I love the stark contrast between the comments of those who have read the webnovel and those who haven‚Äôt üòÇ
31,"Jan 21, 2021",I bet the inside of a monster is a safe zone
31,"Jan 21, 2021",I‚Äôve read so far on this webtoon (as well as finished the novel) that this seems so old to me and now I can‚Äôt remember the past events well üò≠
31,"Jan 20, 2021","I feel like this has something to do with the ""blank"" screen he was staring at"
31,"Jan 20, 2021",That's some next level trust right there... 
31,"Jan 20, 2021",those three clinging to their humanity when everyone else chucked theirs out the window day 1
31,"Jan 20, 2021","imagine dokja just says ""it was nice knowing y'all. peace"" üíÄ"
31,"Jan 20, 2021","I knew Gilyeong was gonna be up for the killing option, not only bc he would follow Dokja but bc he is a kid in this messed up apocalypse, is hard for adults to maintain ""morale"", kids would whether go crazy or resilient to survive, in his case he became resilient and as he's been protected he also wants to protect and be useful. Is not that he is heartless, is that he knows survival is hard and he doesn't want to die or for his team to die. I just love him, so much. "
31,"Jan 20, 2021",Gilyeong must‚Äôve experienced some real s*** if he‚Äôs willing to kill humans...
31,"Jan 20, 2021",Gilyeong like I'll kill a bitch let's fucking go!
31,"Jan 20, 2021",Dokha and Gilyeong's relationship is so cute
31,"Jan 20, 2021",What If the author is a very superior constellation and could see the future so they wrote it all down and the one who reads it to the end will survive it all

Maybe it‚Äôs a bit out there but that‚Äôs what I think the explanation could be.

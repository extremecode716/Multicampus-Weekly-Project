Episode,Date,Review
82,"Dec 8, 2021",I never knew “don’t touch me” means “he is my boyfriend”. Real bad vibes already from the guy sent to destroy earth.
82,"Dec 8, 2021",Dokja used “Paperwork” its super ineffective
82,"Dec 8, 2021","Just Dokja’s luck, the one time he really needs it the naval warfare god does some paperwork"
82,"Dec 8, 2021","NO Myeong Ilsang is not a Regressor, he's a Returnee 😭😭 The only Regressor is Yu Junghyeok. Webtoon pls"
82,"Dec 8, 2021","This typo is actually important. In this case it’s “Returnee”, not “Regressor”
Edit: looks like they changed it! Thank you very much!"
82,"Dec 8, 2021",Naval God really woke up and actively did not choose violence. Damn
82,"Dec 8, 2021",sword song is a gacha skill lmao 😂 poor dokja
82,"Dec 8, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" agrees that constellations also do a ton of paperwork.] [5 coins have been sponsored. ]"
82,"Dec 8, 2021","There seems to have been a mistranslation, as the disaster of questions is supposed to be a returnee not a regressor. Yoo Jonghyuk is a regressor. "
82,"Dec 8, 2021",I know others have said it but I’ll say it again for visibility. He is NOT a regressor- this is a major translation error. The disaster of questions is a Returnee!
82,"Dec 8, 2021",Hate to be that person but ... *Mass Production Maker 
82,"Dec 8, 2021","Bro poor Dokja...That could've been so bad ass but they were like ""nahhh""😭🤣Although I guess our Dokja is a little OP at times so he can't ALWAYS be OP, we gotta see him weak sometimes "
82,"Dec 8, 2021",that skill is literally the equivalent of a double edged blade or Russian roulette in a sense depending on the situation.
82,"Dec 8, 2021","whoevwer is in charge have a twisted mind sending a hero to wipe out an innocent planet  and then use the heroes of said planet on the ""heroes"" planet"
82,"Dec 8, 2021",wait why are they calling Ilsung a regressor when he's a returnee? Returnees are completely different from regressors. His nature is nothing like Jonghyuk 
82,"Dec 8, 2021",You know what I’m glad that they didn’t stop the egg from hatching earlier because it shows that they are fail-able and can’t win every scenario I was starting to think Dokja would never lose this is a nice change from the norm 
82,"Dec 8, 2021","...""the regressor from earth"" no in this case he's a returner/returnee - to regress is to go back in time  and obviously this brat hasn't gone back in time. yjh is the only regressor here "
82,"Dec 8, 2021","We’re experiencing some technical difficulties run with the Naval Warfare God, please come back later "
82,"Dec 8, 2021",The Gacha wasn't on his side
82,"Dec 8, 2021","Just so you know, this guy is not a Regressor, he is a Returnee. It's an important distinction."
82,"Dec 8, 2021","RETURNEE, RETURNEE, not regressor that’s Jonghyuk’s thing "
82,"Dec 8, 2021","Returnee, NOT REGRESSOR. Please fix this translation error or the story will become VERY confusing later on. 
There are three ways to survive the apocalypse… 1) Regressing 2) Returning 3).. Spoilers you will see"
82,"Dec 9, 2021","There are quite a lot of characters here that can be easily seen as evil, but when you take a look at where they came from, like how truly traumatized Antinus could’ve been with what happened to Chronos, making her vengeful; and  like how crazed Myeong Ilsang is from being stuck to be a “hero” in Chronos, I think they’ve just been a bit misunderstood. Although that doesn’t really forgive the fact that Myeong Ilsang is kinda unlikeable, imo. :D"
82,"Dec 11, 2021","He is NOT A REGRESSOR. He is a RETURNEE. And the other ""regressor"" stuff they mentioned here in this chapter should be replaced with ""returnee"" coz that's what they're referring to. Not just Myung ilsang's title. Pls webtoon fix this😭 It's important to distinguish between these terms in regards to the story here. I didn't even care they changed ""disaster"" to ""catastrophe"", but pls fix the ""regressor"" bits."
82,"Jan 12, 2022","to those who are confused; a ""Returnee"" is, say, someone who gets isekai'd then gets returned back to their original planet — while a ""Regressor"" is, well, Yoo Joonghyuk, someone who goes back in time and is able to repeat a certain event (in this case, the apocalypse) from the start"
82,"Dec 8, 2021",guess the pen isnt mightier than the sword for dokja XD
82,"Jan 12, 2022","he is a RETURNEE not regressor as he is someone who returns from another dimension ,but is originally from the earth.. Junghyeok is the only Regressor .. Regressor means someone who regresses again and again in same time loop after dying"
82,"Dec 8, 2021",The Catastrophe counters your paperwork with. High kick… It’s supper effective 
82,"Dec 8, 2021",Waittt does answering the question with a question still counts answering the question……. I am confusion… 
82,"Dec 8, 2021",Dokja's RNG is reaching it's limit
82,"Jan 12, 2022","webtoon, go on hiatus for a few weeks actually read the original NOVEL THEN COME BACK TO TRANSLATE . you guys are ruining translations since day 1 , first you made it TEN ways to survive instead of THREE  then you made yoo junghyeok a REINCARNATOR instead of REGRESSOR , which is actually a pretty important plot point.so please you are just ruining a perfectly fine story with a crappy translation while no listiening to whatever your very own source of income, the readers have to say."
82,"Jan 12, 2022",Also isn’t it meant to be “Mass Production Maker” not “Mass Production Writer”? Webtoon please your translations are killing me.
82,"Jan 12, 2022","anyway, the answer Myung Ilsang needs for breaking his seal doesn't have to be relevant to his question; anything that is said to him in response after he asked a question can he deemed an answer even if it's irrelevant."
82,"Jan 12, 2022","oh god i just realized they used ""Mass Production Writer"" instead of ""Mass Production Maker"".. webtoon, what the hell is with your translations.."
82,"Jan 12, 2022","YOU KNOW WHAT LINE WEBTOON, I. AM. DONE. WITH. YOU. MISTRANS KEEPS ON COMING AND FORWHAT?? 'RETURNEE' TO 'REGRESSOR'? 'MASS PRODUCTION WRITER' INSTEAD OF 'MASS PRODUCTION MAKER'? I'M TIRED OF THIS TOMFOOLERY, LINE WEBTOON. SO MUCH IMPORTANT STUFFS ARE GETTING BURIED BY YOUR LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM. MASSIVE ERRORS KEEPS ON HAPPENING,AT THIS POINT I FEEL LIKE YALL ARE JUST PLAYING WITH US. GET YOUR TRANSLATORS FIRED COS THEYRE NOT DOING THEIR ONE AND ONLY JOB AND THAT IS TO TRANSLATE !!CORRECTLY!!"
82,"Jan 12, 2022","I'm so tired at webtoon's subpar translation. Myung Ilsang is a Returnee, and YJH is the only Regressor. It's not the first time and I'm sure it won't be the last they screwed up tl, and I'm surprised some people still defend them and saying it's ""the same"""
82,"Dec 8, 2021",webtoon just keeps on getting the wrong translation holy crap-- it's gonna be really confusing for people who didnt read the novel if they don't unify the terms;-;
82,"Jan 12, 2022","above all the sour feelings ,I feel bad for Ilsang who was teleported to other old at 17(ig) ,by showing him false hope of being hero and then stuck there for 100 of years alone ,And the antinus ,whose all children were annihilated .. afterall,she is a mother who wants vengeance for her children deaths"
82,"Jan 12, 2022",So like... anyone worried that they aren't eating 3 meals a day and getting enough sleep? Cause they're literally going to die if they don't
82,"Jan 12, 2022","Uhm so webtoon, he isn’t a regressor. He’s a returnee. YJH is the only regressor for a very important reason. "
82,"Jan 12, 2022","I'm so disappointed, the art may have improved but the translation didn't, it's ruining the story. Do they expect for LN readers to explain everything in the comments? Like DO YOUR F*CKING JOB PROPERLY! Is there a way to report this? It needs to be fixed immediately. "
82,"Jan 12, 2022","There's literally an Ebook and like multiple legal AND illegal translations floating around of this story, how the hell does Webtoon keep mistranslating this shit 💀"
82,"Jan 13, 2022",For everyone’s information there is only ONE regressor in this series and it’s not the catastrophe of questions. Ok bye.
82,"Jan 3, 2022",Bro webtoon atleast use correct terminology. Myung Ilsang is a returnee not a regressor. Messing up terminology will make it difficult later on in the story when they are important 
82,"Jan 12, 2022",Shouldn't it be returnee instead of a regressor? A regressor is a person who went back to a certain time. Myung Illsang is a returnee because he (someone from earth) went to another world and came back to earth instead of turning back in time
82,"Dec 13, 2021","Translation error: kindly note that ""Regressor"" referring to the Catastrophe of Questions is false, he's suppposed to be a ""Returnee"", whom went to another planet/dimension and returned. ""Regressor"" is someone like YJH, who would be turned back time to a certain starting point of his life after death. These terms are important in order to understand the core and flow of story, we still have 400+ chps to go. Also, any answer is considered acceptable to Myung Ilsang's questions. "
82,"Dec 8, 2021",“The catastrophe of questions has appeared in your world” His first words: “Could this be?”
82,"Jan 12, 2022","Come on man he is a returnee, and than they wonder why people read less here and more on fan translation sites, smh.
Mass Production Writer? Seriously?!?"
82,"Jan 13, 2022",buhahaha...Dokja's face at the end of the chapter
82,"Jan 12, 2022","How to report mistranslation: >More, >> Settings >>>Help >>>There’s a mistranslation in Originals or something I want to suggest.(very last one). Fill out the form there"
82,"Jan 12, 2022","It's a pity that webtoon as a platform has dropped a lot after the big steps towards monetization. There are more translation mistakes, bots spamming the same website and this problem haven't been solved for many months now. All top comments are from fast pass readers and people don't bother to read other comments and write the same thing over and over... I'm glad that there are important comments like about returnee not being a regressor, that really clarified it for me, but they are exceptions"
82,"Jan 12, 2022",kinda random but Dokla has some pretty eye lashes. 😐 I'm jealous. 
82,"Jan 12, 2022","FFS Webtoons. How is this trash translation the ""official English translation""?!?!?!?!?! RETURNEE not REGRESSOR. This is a huge error. This story is profound & complex deserving of accuracy & consistency. You are failing as translators & these errors are only going to cause confusion later on. Seriously hire any of us novel readers to proofread for you. This is getting ridiculous ."
82,"Jan 13, 2022",webtoon WTF are yall doing lmao at least translate it right omg
82,"Jan 12, 2022","This time he (Myeong Ilsang) is a Returnee, not a Regressor. It's is important to not confuse the new readers 😞"
82,"Jan 12, 2022",oh my god dojka is a slice of life character oh no
82,"Jan 12, 2022","One thing I just realized is that ever since this twsa game/show started in their world, it probably hasn't even been 2 weeks yet of it. All the event we see take place in this story happen really quickly and in rapid succession. To think that the characters are dealing with all this shit and it hasn't even been a long time yet is crazy.. Just a thought that came to mind."
82,"Jan 12, 2022","RESPECTED TRANSLATORS,
I don't mean to undermine your work but there's been a slight mistranslation. It is actually RETURNEE not REGRESSOR. The term 'Regressor' means a person who goes back to a certain point in time after they die. The term 'Returnee' means a person who was sent to another world, usually a fantasy world full of magic beasts, and has returned to their original world. I would appreciate if you fixed this since it might cause confusion among readers.

Sincerely,
A Devoted Reader."
82,"Jan 12, 2022",HE IS A RETURNEE NOT A REGRESSOR
82,"Jan 12, 2022",well naval warfare god really said dokja can't always be OP 😭
82,"Jan 12, 2022",Ilsangs a returnee though??? 
82,"Jan 12, 2022",the dude is a [Returner] NOT a [Regressor]. there has to always be at the very least one mistake per chapter
82,"Jan 12, 2022","insect lady: I will make the world that sent the genocidal hero pay for his actions... by awakening the genocidal hero!!!
makes sense."
82,"Jan 12, 2022","Webtoon pls fix your translation istg. Myung Ilsang is a returnee, not a regressor. "
82,"Jan 12, 2022",Am I the only one who noticed but some of Sangah's facial expressions and almost her vibe seems different than in the previous episodes?
82,"Jan 12, 2022",and constellation of the returnee is not mass production writer but mass production maker..god😑🤦🤦🤦
82,"Jan 12, 2022","Ayo.. what's wrong with webtoon translators? were they high while translating this? it's not ReGrSsoR it's ""returnee"" , god dammit"
82,"Jan 12, 2022",is there anyone who knows how to report the mistranslation to webtoon?
82,"Jan 12, 2022","Those last 2 panels really hit me like a truck after all that rising intensity. (And, based on the comments, I'm glad to know he isn't a regressor. Otherwise I think any regressor could just die and reset/end the current world ... )"
82,"Jan 12, 2022","Wow just wow. It's Returnee not Regressor 🤦. Ms. or Mr. Translator, why? ORV is a complex story, if this keeps up non-LN readers will more confuse. I'm sorry but this translation doesn't do ORV justice AND it's official. Some unofficial sites translates it perfectly, so why can't the OFFICIAL site do it properly? "
82,"Jan 12, 2022",MASS PRODUCTION MAKER NOT WRITER WEBTOON PLS!!!!!!
82,"Jan 12, 2022","Would you mind getting someone to translate this correctly for once? Ffs, it’s RETURNEE not REGRESSOR, those are two very different things"
82,"Jan 1, 2022",You can tell Myeong is an Isekai protagonist because he doesn't respect women lol. 
82,"Dec 8, 2021",All those aura just to do some paperwork. LOL
82,"Jan 14, 2022","@WEBTOON for the millionth time, 𝙙𝙤 𝙣𝙤𝙩 change the meaning of words, new readers will get confused. The book was called ""three ways of survival"" for a reason, and this guy being a returnee is one of them. Junghyeok is the only regressor. "
82,"Jan 14, 2022","Maybe I'm the only one but I think questions guy could be useful (if they put him on a leash). I get that he's violent but he's been trapped on a planet with talking bugs, the kid has been through a lot. 
And I think the key is to respond with another question."
82,"Jan 13, 2022",41 days until C O A T
82,"Jan 13, 2022",dokja: wait hold it I just had a fookin bruh moment
82,"Jan 13, 2022",Lol naval warfare god doin homework rn
82,"Jan 13, 2022","Many readers already said it, but Myeong Ilsang is a Returnee and not a Regressor. Being a Returnee is a whole scale different from a Regressor. Only Yoo Joonghyuk has the Regressor stigma, and the only Regressor himself as is. I hope that it could be fixed soon, so the Webtoon readers won't be confused."
82,"Jan 12, 2022","""Day 28. Clear skies. I went to do some paperwork"" wait, what ? Lmao, no"
82,"Jan 12, 2022","""Although, you'll die just the same"" wow, such trust"
82,"Jan 12, 2022",everyone meet the disaster that never stops talking
82,"Jan 12, 2022",how did we convince webtoon to change Immortal King to King of No Killing again? How did we get webtoon to notice us? Let's do that again so the translation gets fixed again
82,"Jan 12, 2022",Uh... false translation?He is not a regressor. He's a returnee
82,"Jan 12, 2022","FFS, the TL messed up between Returnee and Regressor AGAIN."
82,"Jan 12, 2022",why do I feel like this castarophe is him from an au?
82,"Jan 12, 2022","fool, yjh is his boyfriend."
82,"Jan 12, 2022","Isnt Myung Ilsang's Sponsor ""Mass Production Maker""? This is also an important typo other than the regressor typo. Webtoon please "
82,"Jan 12, 2022","If people are confused about the difference between a regressor and a returnee, this post on the ORV subreddit is really useful: https://www.reddit.com/r/OmniscientReader/comments/r7dyyr/the_beings_of_orv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
82,"Jan 12, 2022","did they really call him a regresser? pls webtoon, I really thought you guys were getting better but no!😭😭 for God's sake he is a reternee not a regresser😩 regresser and reterner are two different things!!!!!"
82,"Jan 13, 2022","dear translators, i know you're official paid translators but please use fan translation or orv wiki at least. we as novel readers would really appreciate that 🧎‍♀️I don't know how you can change maker to writer, but a returnee becoming a regressor is a major error and critical to the plot, YJH is the only regressor here "
82,"Jan 12, 2022",mass production writer...?? but I thought the constellation of myun illsang was mass production maker? there's a huge difference between maker and writer. oh well translation complaint x2
82,"Dec 8, 2021",I will never ✨not✨ spend my coins on this webtoon 🥳
82,"Aug 10, 2022","Dokja: Alright, time to end this bishThe naval god: Hold up G i haven't done my taxes yet"
82,"Jan 19, 2022",YAY THEY FIXED IT!! HE'S A RETURNEE
82,"Jan 18, 2022",Yas guys! We did it! They've changed it!
82,"Jan 17, 2022",I absolutely love the art of this webtoon
82,"Jan 17, 2022","Even the creature sent to earth specifically to destroy it, had to pause for a second to acknowledge: ""Wow, you're pretty.""EVERYONE really does love Sangah! If she follows that up with ""How are you?"" and ""Gosh, being alone must have been tough"", the Catastrophe won't stand a chance."
82,"Jan 15, 2022",I now sympathize with antinus
82,"Jan 15, 2022","I request those reading this comment with enough time on hand to kindly go and report these mistranslations. It'll help those who can't understand wtf is happening. >More, >>Setting >>>Help >>>>There's a mistranslation in Originals or something I want to suggest(at very bottom). Then fill out the form. On the web it's > Help>> There's a mistranslation in Originals or something I want to suggest(again at very bottom)."
82,"Jan 14, 2022","okay webtoon you before mistaken yoo joonghyuk who is regressor as returnee. and now myung ilsang who is returnee as regressor *sigh, is there proof reader job? I will do it for you webtoon just for ORV"
82,"Jan 14, 2022","So for those wondering, the Disaster of Questions is NOT a Regressor. He’s supposed to be called a Returnee but it was translated wrong"
82,"Jan 14, 2022","Don’t touch me ≠ He’s my boyfriend, lmao"
82,"Jan 14, 2022","so hi I'm saying this because I'm curious,so I'm not a spender I don't even have coins in this webtoon or even irl(life sucks)so if you don't want to get spoiled then don't read this,my comment might also be true,so jung whatever is the protagonist in the TWSA right?what if there's an another author,same story but the protagonist is dokj and that he's the real protagonist and that TWSA was just the part of the story of the man who made dokj the main??"
82,"Jan 14, 2022","bro the disaster of questions is not a regressor? i hope they fix it, it could cause confusion for the later plot points"
82,"Jan 13, 2022",This episode was funny 😂
82,"Jan 13, 2022","Not a fan of how they handled him. Simply saying something to him after he asks a question is not always an answer. If simply saying a response counts to breaking his seals, then his seals would have been broken when the lady under the rubble replied to him with questions. It's inconsistent."
82,"Jan 13, 2022","Webtoon will never see this but man.A regressor is someone who goes back through time (I.E Yoo Junghyeok). He is the only person able to do this no one else can.
Ilsung is a RETURNEE, someone who’s returned back to their home (same time). There is a very big difference between the two and it’s disgusting how they made them the same"
82,"Jan 13, 2022",Returnee. RETURNEE. NOT Regressor
82,"Jan 13, 2022","ahh so this problematic bastard finally showed up in eng version,,"
82,"Jan 13, 2022",myeong ilsang is NOT A REGRESSOR HE'S A RETURNEE please change the translation dear translator i beg😭🙏 this will cause a really bad confusion in the future for webtoon only readers 😭 returnee is person who got transmigrated to another world for a while and then get sent back to their own world . Regressor (yoo joonghyuk) is a person who got sent to another worldline after experiencing near death. 
82,"Jan 12, 2022","Man, the worst catastrophe. He looks disgusting and speaks trash"
82,"Jan 12, 2022",Now I'm beginning to wonder if Dokja being warned to look out for that girl didn't mean a bad thing. Maybe it was meant that she liked him?
82,"Jan 12, 2022","to be fair, the naval warfare god doesn't know what ""coming in clutch"" means"
82,"Jan 12, 2022",Why does that hero look like Dokja?
82,"Jan 12, 2022","""Don't touch me "" is not an answer to his question ! "
82,"Jan 12, 2022",A side story about Myeong Ilsang would be really interesting... Love myself a good old hero to villain story 😍
82,"Jan 12, 2022",A returnee not a regressor 
82,"Jan 12, 2022","That was actually the perfect timing for that to happen, story-wise. It can't be an OP skill always, and the attack strength really is randomized with all the phrases that would be available. Plus, if such a boss is killed instantly, that would be over too quick... But man was that a great tension-splitter."
82,"Jan 12, 2022","The second way to survive the apocalypse is here everyone! edit: spoke too soon, the second way of survival should be returnee. Two of the three ways of survival that's been revealed now are Regression and to Return."
82,"Dec 29, 2021",Dokja just got gacha'd lmao tough luck my guy
82,"Jan 18, 2022",TJEY CHANGED IT YEAGHHHHGGG now we hope they don't make any more mistranslations :]]
82,"Jan 18, 2022","indirect answers count....thats crazy. Also being that it was an indirect one, Sangah be crushin hard huh"
82,"Jan 17, 2022",I hope our main character becomes a constalation in the end ( you know cause the title is ominecint reader 
82,"Jan 16, 2022","Nice paperwork naval warfare god, really helped Dokja there 👌"
82,"Jan 14, 2022",i think he is a RETURNEE not a REGRESSOR. he returned to earth from another world. He dint regress or turn back in time
82,"Jan 14, 2022",The RNG constellation did Dokja dirty 💀💀
82,"Jan 13, 2022",A post about the mistranslations and what you should do (cause spamming the comment section isn't working): https://www.reddit.com/r/OmniscientReader/comments/s2n48a/the_translation_issues_of_the_webtoon/
82,"Jan 13, 2022",why did I think the guy would have white hair tho....
82,"Jan 13, 2022",I'm curious to know why Ilsang destroyed Chronos if he was sent to be a hero ? does the hero's mission include destroying the world they are sent to and not protecting it ?
82,"Jan 13, 2022",Wow the artwork is so awesome every week! Loved this chapter 👍🔥
82,"Jan 13, 2022","Now c'mon, Naval Warfare God..."
82,"Jan 12, 2022",''I went to do some paperwork'' Me: Yeah uhhh-Papercuts hurrrrrrrttttttttt?!
82,"Jan 12, 2022",What on EARTH happened??? That sentence sounds like something coming from Dokja's diary...?!
82,"Jan 12, 2022",no offence to isekai hero protagonists but I’ll never agree to be transported to another world to save it / I think I’m happy with my own powers and problems / also I’m pretty sure I’ll become villainous with all that power
82,"Jan 12, 2022","Come Out, Dokja! *Dokja used, Paperwork* Ineffective*200 damage taken!"
82,"Jan 12, 2022","webtoon stop having worse translations than scanelation sites please, so many webtoon readers will be so confused even if you fix your mistake later on, god damnit. have somebody who actually read the novel proof read it before publishing"
82,"Jan 12, 2022",What happened to the Wolf guy That’s supposed to be helping? 
82,"Jan 12, 2022","I noticed really faint tattoos on the catastrophe’s body, but when I looked to before his first seal was broken, they weren’t there. Maybe they represent his power, how many seals have been broken?"
82,"Jan 12, 2022","Lmao, sword song is the stigma equivalent of a magic 8 ball and dokja just got screwed"
82,"Jan 12, 2022",OH MY GOD HOW COULD YOU DO THIS WEBTOON ITS RETURNEE!!!!! NOT REGRESSOR
82,"Jan 12, 2022",he's a returner not a regressor
82,"Jan 12, 2022",I've already read the novel and still reading the manhwa cause it's so good😭 Author nice artwork🦋
82,"Jan 12, 2022","Myung Ilsang is a returnee, this is very important thing for the next few chapters and the future chapters as well. Junghyeok is the regressor"
82,"Jan 12, 2022",My shower thoughts include how easy fighting Antinus would be if Gilyoung was here 🤔 
82,"Jan 12, 2022","""Regressor""? Who is translating this? He is a returnee, it's a different thing"
82,"Jan 12, 2022","[Demon King, Demon King of Intrigue, is outraged by the mistranslation of Returnee into Regressor!]
[Demon King, Demon King of Intrigue, says that this is very important that these 2 terms are distinct!]"
82,"Jan 12, 2022","Ah yes, paperwork, thee thing we can always count on to ruin our lives."
82,"Dec 30, 2021","So big translation Change that needs to happen asap MYEONG ILSANG IS NOT a regressor. He's a returnee. Major difference and relevant for the plot of the story and lore. SPOILER ALERT : But the Three ways to survive in a ruined world... just like how one of those is Regression: becoming a regressor, another is Returning: becoming a returnee. He's just returned from his transmigration from earth and now he has the strength to survive or spell apocalypse for Seoul. "
82,"Dec 28, 2021",pls for the love of god change the regressor to returnee. there will only one regressor and this is very important terms

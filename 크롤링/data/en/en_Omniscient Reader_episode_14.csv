14,"Oct 6, 2022",I understand Dokja's feelings towards wanting to make Yu Junghyeok recognise him as his companion. When you spend such a long time with a character that character becomes a part of you..You wish to be there for them through thick & thin & actually become their companion. I think Dokja's intentions here towards Yu are very pure

Meaning he's planned this whole thing out and wrote TWSA for Dokja to read. Second, it said in the beginning when Dokja saw Secretive Plotters name on the constellation option list that he'd never seen that constellations name before. It would make sense if Secreitve plotter didn't put his own identity in the story, hence the ""secretive"". (More below)"

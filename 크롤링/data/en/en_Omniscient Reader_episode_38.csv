Episode,Date,Review
38,"Jan 20, 2021",A bug master with access to prehistoric insects... The potential carnage is unimaginable 
38,"Jan 20, 2021",i cant get over how she calls him old man 
38,"Jan 20, 2021",That nervous smile at the end is what we live for
38,"Jan 20, 2021",I can’t get over the fact that dojka has the fatherly instinct and grabs gilyoung at the end. 
38,"Jan 20, 2021",When you read it to fast🥲 and can we take a moment to look at dokjas face when the boy picked up the bug
38,"Jan 20, 2021","jihye- "" imma cut it "" gilyeong- "" ill make you my pet"" jihye- ""???? tf????"""
38,"Jan 20, 2021",My baby is so fucking dangerously adorable he can control/communicate with such a huge insect 
38,"Jan 22, 2021",I love how Dokja just picks the kid up and runs. so adorable
38,"Jan 20, 2021","The real reward are the friends we made on our trip. Dojkja: i don't care give me my 5,000 coins"
38,"Jan 20, 2021","*Giant Murder Mantis the size of a German Shepherd* Gilyeong: ""Puppy! Good Boy :)"""
38,"Jan 20, 2021","Huiwon- I love cutting stuff with swords!
Jihye- Ah yes, I see you are a person of culture as well."
38,"Jan 22, 2021",I love how swordgirl doesn't act edgy anymore :D Everybody gangsta untill prehistoric raptor comes after you.
38,"Jan 20, 2021","Next thing you know ""Master"" is riding on a dinosaur with a cowboy hat yelling yee haw. Dokja would be so done and just leave"
38,"Jan 20, 2021",i have a big feeling that the reward of the movie they are in might be used by gilyeong/the kid
38,"Jan 20, 2021",Greatest series ever read hipe everyone is as happy as I am with this and the creator should definitely get this into an animation studio when it's done  
38,"Jan 20, 2021","I love how as everything is getting ripped apart around him, the ground trembling below his feet, Dokja is just grinning thinking about the loot. "
38,"Jan 21, 2021",It's so cute how Dokja just picked him up and runs away. 
38,"Jan 20, 2021",i just wish these episodes came out everyday
38,"Jan 20, 2021",Imagine your in a movie theatre in real life and you see a new Jurassic park movie poster then boom T-Rex like just imagine
38,"Jan 20, 2021",That girl talk tho
38,"Mar 10, 2021",I love how gilyeoung just casually took that insect 🤣
38,"Jan 21, 2021",Anyone else just love Jiyhe’s facial expressions? 
38,"Jan 20, 2021",Can we all just take a moment to appreciate the art!! It looks amazing!
38,"Jan 22, 2021","So I accidentally subbed to this comic when it was just starting. The comic was at the beginning, not even 5 chapters in. And I kept telling myself I'll read the comic one day... hahaha... Why didn't I read this sooner? This is one of the best comics I've read so far on webtoons. Granted I don't read a lot of webtoon comics but my point still stands. "
38,"Jan 22, 2021","Our boi, Gilyeong doing highsie-upsies with a giant grasshopper while laughing is E V E R Y T H I N G, i’m crying 😭"
38,"Jan 22, 2021",Laughed out loud so hard when I saw the movie poster...
38,"Jan 21, 2021",You did it..You crazy son of a bitch you did It!
38,"Jan 20, 2021",our best boy was so happy to make a new frieeeennd!! 🤩😭
38,"Feb 6, 2021",*sigh* a young boy and his bug. PRECIOUS tbh im jelly of the green cutie
38,"Jan 20, 2021","⚠️⚠️⚠️major spoiler//character spoiler⚠️⚠️⚠️Oh my god the prophets are mentioned which means we can soon see Han sooyoung illustrated, the full set of bastards will be complete"
38,"Mar 10, 2021","Ah, just two ladies bonding over sword fighting,  we love to see it"
38,"Mar 10, 2021","""just what the hell is triggering this change?"" oh idk, you?"
38,"Mar 10, 2021",Dokja outwardly: I want the loot. Y'all might all die. I wouldn't do the same for you. Whatever. Dokja on the inside: A caring yet calculating man who's even more suave (if that's possible) than he appears.
38,"Mar 10, 2021",One day...just one day I hope to see Gilyeong having a bug on a leash as if it's a dog and Dokja just acting like it's an everyday thing while everyone is confused
38,"Mar 10, 2021",Lowkey simped for the girls during their convo (I love swords so much lmao) and then I fell in love with dokja when I saw that nervous 'oh sht wtf' smile
38,"Jan 20, 2021","I've been thinking this for the last few chapters, Huiwon deserves a better weapon. Her ability makes her the strongest melee fighter on the team, she should have something better than that bone sword Dokja made for all of them."
38,"Mar 10, 2021",lol that last part Dojka just snatches the kid and runs 😭
38,"Mar 10, 2021",I love it how dokja's son(at this point he totally is) just causally grabs the bug and makes a buddy he's too precious 
38,"Mar 10, 2021","Anyone else noticed the poster with the Han Myungoh, with Yu Sangah and bicycle in the credits? Referring to how he stole her bike."
38,"Jan 20, 2021",😥 i never thought someone could make holding a giant insect look nice
38,"Mar 10, 2021",that’s a strange looking dog gilyoung
38,"Mar 10, 2021",Dokja's face when gilyeong picked up the bug was gold.
38,"Mar 10, 2021",Please let him keep the big bug. Be the cutest fricken pikachu/ash relationship ever
38,"Jan 20, 2021","So, uh...Huiwon. I understand that you might feel a bit shameful because you hyped up a teenager about having a nifty sword (even when said sword is made out of monster bones). But but but...get this, ok. Yeah, steel swords are very shiny and effective and what not but have you considered....getting a sword made of dinosaur bones? Grab some T-rex teeth, amputate those lil arms of his and you got yourself a nifty prehistoric sword. You'd be looking pretty bada**. "
38,"Mar 10, 2021",Welcome... to jurrasic park
38,"Mar 10, 2021","Gilding and that insect was the most adorable thing. Scratch, no, add that. All Gilyung scenes are precious. "
38,"Mar 10, 2021","I too admire cool older women. Yes, I am gay. 🌈"
38,"Mar 13, 2021","ok but dokja says he isn't the main character... but hes 6ft, attractive, got some weird cocky lovable energy, and just like takes initiative. and he looks out for people and is so good with children??? sure sure not a main character"
38,"Mar 11, 2021",Dokja:*acting like the dad who never seem as a caring dad but he's proud of his son and very protective*
38,"Mar 10, 2021","The writer of this is a genius, I would have never imagined such creative dungeons. And everything is so well tied, marvelous."
38,"Mar 10, 2021",But imagine if they were in a cheesy romcom movie instead
38,"Mar 10, 2021","on one of the posters one of the cast members was Samuel R Jackson..and on another there was a bicycle on the cover and one of the cast members was literally ""bicycle"" lmao"
38,"Mar 10, 2021","UGH FCK. HIS WAIST,,,, 😳😳 IS SNATCHED AS EVER,,,,,,, ,😩💞💞"
38,"Mar 10, 2021",Lol Birassic Park came out Winter 2020
38,"Feb 25, 2021","Goddamn every chapter that passes this thing gets better, author mate, wtf are you on HOW IS THIS SO GOOD? "
38,"Mar 11, 2021",Welcome....to Jurassic Park. -THEME MUSIC PLAYS- 🦕
38,"Jan 20, 2021","finally I can see Yu Junghyeok sitting :"""
38,"Mar 10, 2021",so I wonder if dokja is gonna spend a good chunk of the series just trying to keep junghyeok alive because he doesn't wanna take the risk of what'll happen if he dies (whether it's the world being reset or simply losing junghyeok)
38,"Mar 11, 2021",I read this at work and I almost fell out of my desk chair when I saw they were going into Jurassic Park.
38,"Jan 20, 2021",Mmm! Funky little bug man :)

38,"Mar 24, 2021",Gilyeong's face when he grabbed the large insect 😂

38,"Mar 10, 2021",Gilyeong becoming friends with the Titanoptera instantly... cute
38,"Jan 20, 2021",Huiwon is most definitely a woman of culture. Respect those all-nighters watching trilogies/sagas
38,"Mar 11, 2021",why is no one talking about the Birassic Park poster? Samuel R. Johnson. Jeoff Silverbrum. classic.
38,"Jul 17, 2021","Ah yes, what a lovely family outing."
38,"May 12, 2021",Dokja should help his party get better weapons 😅
38,"May 2, 2021",I love how dokja’s first instinct is to always grab gilyeong

38,"Mar 10, 2021","Dokja and the little boy (forgot his name) have the cutest relationship ever, it is so wholesome how they're always looking out for eachother "

38,"Mar 10, 2021","As soon as Dojka read the tagline I was like ""lol for some reason that remind me of  Jurassic Par-""  and then I saw the poster 😄"
38,"Mar 10, 2021",I'm just wondering the damage scale Gilyeong could cause if this game was set in Australia...
38,"Mar 10, 2021",Lowkey.... wanna see Dokja tame a t-rex...
38,"Jan 22, 2021","At this point, I think I know why Junghyeok wanted to recruit Gilyeong. He knows that there!s a Jurassic movie that gives out big rewards and him finding out that Gilyeong can commune with animals, he thought the he could be very useful for him in his “plan.”"
38,"Mar 10, 2021","Until now, i didn't know, it's the Jihye and Huiwon friendship duo is what i needed lmao"
38,"Nov 4, 2021",Aww the way he carries gilyoung
38,"Aug 6, 2021","Inside a movie, inside a livestream, inside a comic, inside a comic. Jeez."

38,"May 5, 2021","*sees poster for Jurassic Park*""Oh s**t."""
38,"May 4, 2021","My dear team members, welcome to Jurassic Park !"
38,"May 1, 2021",This has both “welcome to jumani” and “welcome to Jurassic Park” vibes
38,"Apr 9, 2021",The way Dokja picks up and carries Gilyeong every time they get in a bind is really heartwarming. [the constellation Lonely Weeb is touched by those actions.]
38,"Mar 24, 2021",""" your not my son but I am your dad """
38,"Mar 24, 2021",I like bug boi. :)

38,"Mar 12, 2021",I've just realized that the likes on this series is going down just like did when dojka was reading it 
38,"Mar 11, 2021","In the novel, Jihye addresses Heewon with -unnie at the end which is a term for younger females to address older females. Jihye addresses Dokja as ahjussi which is a term for middle aged men. Dokja is only 28 so Jihye is being rude on purpose to him. It got translated as old man. But to be fair Dokja does have an old man vibe to him most of the time."
38,"Mar 11, 2021",dokja running with gilyeong in his arms 🥺
38,"Mar 11, 2021",Awww look at Gilyeong and his bug buddy- Oh also the giant dinosaur trying to kill them all
38,"Mar 11, 2021",this webtoon is so good that i kind awish i found it after it was finished >.< i hate waiting to find out more in such an interesting story ;-; keep up the amazing work though cant wait for more!!!
38,"Mar 11, 2021",This webtoon is so good. I feel like im the one in a movie when i read it. Author deserves more money than they are already getting. 🙂
38,"Mar 11, 2021","For everyone wondering what to make of Dokja... Based on a recent Trope Talk by Overly Sarcastic Productions, I believe I have the answer. He's a rare Charismaniac protagonist. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuJPBPDpq-I"
38,"Mar 11, 2021","That’s one of the reasons Junghyeok wanted Gilyeong with him huh, he needed his skills to help him clear the dungeon "
38,"Mar 11, 2021",(chuckles) Dr. Grant. My dear Dr. Sattler. Welcome to Jurassic Park.
38,"Mar 10, 2021","I too, in fact, admire cool older women. I guess Jihye and I are soulmates or smth."
38,"Mar 10, 2021",It's a dinosaur🦕 Rawr
38,"Mar 10, 2021","""I admire cool older women"" are you sure you're not just a lesbian"
38,"Mar 10, 2021",this is the best webtoon you could ever ask for . best of the best.
38,"Mar 10, 2021",Am I the only one who laughed hard at Uriel???
38,"Mar 10, 2021","Dokja Hammond: ""Welcome... To Jurassic Park!"" "
38,"Mar 10, 2021",this webnovel needs anime adaptation by MAPPA
38,"Mar 10, 2021",Dokja just grabbed himm kinda cute 😊 seems like  father -son relationship
38,"Mar 10, 2021",the last panel has meme potential
38,"Mar 10, 2021",its jurassic park right? right??
38,"Mar 10, 2021",I'm just thinking that what if after completing this webtoon things begins to happen WE THE ALL READERS Could form a guild and it's name would be  omniscient readers guild...😲😀😀😀
38,"Mar 10, 2021","as a fucking geologist, this made me so damn happy!!!!!! "

38,"Mar 10, 2021",Every chapter is quality. Like I feel satisfied with the progression. This is awesome!
38,"Mar 10, 2021",At least it's not Jumanji
38,"Mar 10, 2021",Every time I finish an episode I just sit here and I'm like damn.... This WEBTOON is just amazing... Damn
38,"Mar 10, 2021","They got so preoccupied with that they COULD enter, and never stopped to wonder whether they SHOULD"

38,"Jan 20, 2021","absolute masterpiece of a webtoon I get excited everytike there's an update, a constant tug at my wallet but I'd just say be careful of burning out id hate to see the health of the artist(s) or the quality of webtoob diminish "
38,"Jan 20, 2021",I love the Webnovel! I am loving the Webtoon even more! Cannot wait for more! Keep up the amazing work!
38,"Nov 8, 2021",LMAOOOO NOT JURASSIC PARK OF ALL MOVIES 😂😭💀 I love how we saw some bonding between Huiwon and Jihye (also Jihye is giving very much sappho vibe) and we're seeing Jihye come out of her shell and be a normal teen 😂 Her reaction to Gil and the bug was funnyyyy
38,"Sep 12, 2021",*Dnager appears* Dokja: I must protect the child!
38,"Jul 29, 2021",I love how he grabs the kid and runs. Makes sure kid doesn’t fall behind 💖

38,"Mar 12, 2021","I know they're in trouble, but I could the scene with gilyoung and the big buggie will exist in my mind rent free🥺"
38,"Mar 12, 2021",Oh wow that just switched from jumangi to Jurassic park real quick
38,"Mar 12, 2021",The shading and colors in this Webtoon are gorgeous. The artist somehow even makes the muted pallets pretty.
38,"Mar 11, 2021","In korean Jihye calls dokja ""ahjussi"". ""ahjussi"" literally means old man but it is casually used to refer to someone who is older than me. Because some girls feel cringey to call older man ""oppa""(which means older brother) , they use ""ahjussi"" instead. It's definitely not a polite honorifics, but it can be kind of friendly one to call older man :)"
38,"Mar 11, 2021",welcome to Jurassic fucking park
38,"Mar 11, 2021",anyone else hoping the kid can take the giant mantis with him? 😍

38,"Mar 10, 2021","Whenever Jihye stops acting cold she’s actually really enjoyable. Also, Seeing Gilyeong grow up in this story would be pretty cool. For unrelated reasons of course."

38,"Mar 10, 2021",The last panel was Jihye regretting accompanying Dokja.

38,"Sep 8, 2021",i really like it when they carry Gilyeong
38,"Aug 29, 2021","Soo if Junghyeok is a complete sociopath at his 3rd regression, what kind of monster did he turn into when he reached the double digits😨 I'm also curious if the world gets reset or if continues on just with Junghyeok dead which might make surviving incredibly difficult if not impossible depending on his overall importance "
38,"Aug 27, 2021",can we appreciate how cute gilyeong is when he laugh with the insect T^T
38,"Aug 7, 2021",i thought it was jumanji😭😭

38,"Jul 3, 2021",what. in. the. JUMANJI. 
38,"Jul 2, 2021",i was curious how theyd handle the potentially copyright infringing parts from these chapters
38,"Jul 2, 2021",We all know what movie this is. Bee Movie!
38,"Jun 28, 2021",hmm i wonder if “the prophets” are the other TWSA readers of the initial chapters? and maybe that’s why the story is getting off track also. I’ve been wondering ever since the beginning of any other TWSA readers are also in this story. But I guess they wouldn’t have the omniscient reader attribute and would just have to rely on memory and also have significantly less information…
38,"Jun 28, 2021",this reminds of jumanji 
38,"Jun 25, 2021",u like movies well ur about to get jurrassskicked by one

38,"Apr 27, 2021","“I’m here to stop Junghyeok Yu from Regressing by Death” You know, I was wondering why people were upset when Regressor was (incorrectly) translated as Returnee in the early chapters. It makes perfect sense now."
38,"Apr 27, 2021",‘Burasic Park’ wow
38,"Apr 27, 2021",this scenario reminds me of the scene in ready player one where they entered “the shining” movie
38,"Apr 27, 2021",I thought it might be jurassic Park
38,"Apr 27, 2021",imagine your life becoming a fictional novel (I guess non fiction now) you read and now you are in a fictional world  that was in the fictional novel that existed before this whole fiasco.

38,"Apr 11, 2021","I wonder what would've happened if Dokja hadn't stopped him from communicating with that huge insect on the outside....well, they would've probably died since his skill's level isn't high enough yet?"
38,"Apr 11, 2021","JOHN HENRY FABRE MY MAN!! YEEEES!! I read his book on entomology, ""The Insect World"" so good, highly recommend 😩🤌"

38,"Mar 10, 2021",I'm so curious about the prophets. We haven't had any unpredictable antagonists yet so i think they might become really good comrades alongside Dokja or against him. The question is who they actually are and how much they know.

38,"Mar 10, 2021",so no one will talk about the fact that they are in Jurassic parck ?? juste me? Ok 
38,"Mar 10, 2021",I love how dokja just says “A movie:)”

38,"Oct 8, 2022",Wait... Dokja doesn't know what happens to the world abandoned by the regressor. Meaning he doesn't know what'll happen if Yu dies here! I think that's why he's trying to save Yu. What if they continue to exist as a parallel universe even after Yu's death? That would mean even Dokja will become powerless in the face of the arriving circumstances! He wouldn't know what to do & he might even die!
38,"Oct 8, 2022",Dokja asking all the good questions i see. What happens to the world after the regressor dies? Does the world get reset as well or does it continue to exist as a parallel universe? I loved these questions 
38,"Oct 8, 2022","I think i understand Yu Junghyeok a bit better through those first few initial lines of the chapter. Time travel sure can suck a lot for the time traveller. Especially when they're trying to save someone. You keep going back & forth through the same thing, trying your best every time, but you can still never be sure that the one you're trying to save can actually be saved. No wonder Yu has become the sort of person that he is. And this is only his 3rd round."

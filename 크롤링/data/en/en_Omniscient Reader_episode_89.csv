Episode,Date,Review
89,"Jan 26, 2022","“How can a mere human know so much?!” Reading is knowledge. Knowledge is power. If you chuck a book at someone’s head, it’ll even hit em with enlightenment"
89,"Jan 26, 2022","I lost it when ""Prisoner of the Golden Headband"" started chanting his name to be chosen for the sponsor. He's been with Dokja since the beginning and I would deffo love to see him be picked at the very end. (Btw there's spoilers so proceed at your own caution everyone!!)<-- Thank You Kikyo for putting that out. Didn't occur to me about the spoilers at the moment."
89,"Jan 26, 2022",He always shakes up the constellations and surprises them...I love it🤣I love how he just *guessed* and got it right when they asked who he is🤣But...in order for the question to be answered it just has to be true and the other part must believe it?
89,"Jan 26, 2022","Zeus legit said “shut the hell up, you’ve said to much”"
89,"Jan 26, 2022",that chapter was an illegal amount of info dump … 😂😅
89,"Jan 26, 2022","Dokja used what is known as a ""pro gamer move"""
89,"Jan 26, 2022","I'm never going to get over how good this webtoon is, really lives up to the novel in every way"
89,"Jan 26, 2022",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' is curious about the singularity and on how it will affect the future scenarios.][The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' is satisfied to get free reliable information.][5 coins have been sponsored. ]
89,"Jan 26, 2022","imagine being teleported into an anime world and one of the characters ask you how you know shit. then you reply with ""i'm a weeb"""
89,"Jan 26, 2022",He really told ariadne all her deepest secrets and publicly embarassed her on the stream huh
89,"Jan 26, 2022",That was a shocking end to the conversation 
89,"Jan 26, 2022","I bet sangah was wondering how this chapter would end, and then it struck her"
89,"Jan 26, 2022","This webtoon never fails to amaze me with not only its story and art style, but the various angles and timing used to deliver information. Using those assets can really push a story forward, and the creator of this takes full advantage of that"
89,"Mar 2, 2022","For those who don't know the context. Ariadne was a Cretan princess, daughter of King Minos. When Theseus (Greek, specifically Athenian hero) arrived to cease the tributes (14 youths to feed the Minotaur, 7 each gender) she became infatuated with him and gave him a ball of yarn to find his way out of the Minotaur's labyrinth. When Theseus sailed home he left Ariadne on the island of Naxos for a myriad of possible reasons. Regardless of the reason, Dionysus god of wine rescued and married her."
89,"Jan 26, 2022","""Carrying the burden of destiny on their backs"" must be so lonely, because you think because it's fate you cannot change it no matter how hard you try... "
89,"Jan 26, 2022",They must be extremely cautious of him despite having the same objective of saving the world. I’m sure they might assume he could just be plotting a long con to turn on everyone so it’s interesting to see the hostility they showed him instead of wanting to work together.
89,"Jan 26, 2022",we fans really being called out under the name [Constellation who doesn't want the excitement to end] huh? 😏😎
89,"Jan 26, 2022","dojka signature move is mess with fate. this story just keeps getting better and better, constant unraveling to the next chapter. "
89,"Mar 2, 2022","To explain the Rule of Plausibility in a few words, it's an universal rule to avoid characters from being OP or lose of balance in a story. Saitama, or The Gamer, for example are too OP for their own story and would be considered as Cheating. So the Rules of Plausibility ensures that Nobody messes up too much using their own power."
89,"Jan 26, 2022","Sangah when she wakes up: ""Ow jesus what the hell happened to me and why do I smell ozone?"""
89,"Jan 26, 2022","""I've read a lot of book"". Man if I can be that op just from reading books....."
89,"Jan 26, 2022","It's really interesting seeing how even with the knowledge and power the constellations have, they still can't seem to think of Dokja as more than a coincidence in the way of their goals. Really looking forward to what happens next."
89,"Jan 26, 2022","[Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" chuckles as to be present to a group of constellations being played by an incarnation without a sponsor, 5 coins have been gifted.] [ Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" is now curious as to which group of constellations is sponsoring Anna Croft?]"
89,"Jan 26, 2022","I wonder what the constellations reactions will be when Dokja is like “haha, no constellation for me” presuming that is what he will do.  "
89,"Jan 26, 2022",Hmmm this plot just got a lot deeper. Is Dokja an instrument of fate who used the WEBTOON to send back his past self information who wouldn’t have memories of what’s to come?
89,"Jan 26, 2022","You see, teachers do this all the time. 2 truths one lie, as you may know, it's intended to be an icebreaker......yeah I think we have a glacier's worth of ice just made in this chapter"
89,"Jan 27, 2022",No other webtoon captivates me the way this one does
89,"Jan 26, 2022",i wonder... does using free coins give benefits to the author? Because I keep using my free coins for ORV thinking it will help but since it's free.. idk if it will??? 🤷🏻‍♀️
89,"Mar 2, 2022","ah, of course there's a snippet of YJH appear on this chapter with his ✨wide and lonely back✨"
89,"Jan 26, 2022","Agh I really wanted her to answer the oracle question🥲 since dokja doesn’t know what it is, do u think it’s something outside the storyline? Maybe the oracle was the one who picked who could be a regressor or returnee. Idk"
89,"Mar 2, 2022","I'm just sitting here ticked pink that he answered Ariadne's question with ""I'm a big dweeb who's read too many comics based on your mythology"" and she was like. GASP! IMPOSSIBLE, HOW COULD THIS INSIGNIFICANT COUNTRY HALFWAY ACROSS THE WORLD HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF US. I was not expecting such an obvious answer to work but both she and the system swallowed it without question lmao"
89,"Mar 2, 2022",I swear this man going to become a constellation that sponsors himself.
89,"Feb 17, 2022","Truth be told, as a classics major in college, the Olympos  mythos is pretty popular worldwide not ver conspicuous Ariadne. Once I started seeing the names of Greek gods popping up, I kinda figured the fates made the Greek gods meddle somewhere. Zeus listens to the fates because even he can’t ignore in some cases defy them. Would be cool if Sangha could lift the firmament like Heracles or use Athenas wisdom. Zeus’s power of changing nature would be cool too but op if interpreted a certain way."
89,"Mar 2, 2022",A singularity is… a main character! Lmao 
89,"Mar 2, 2022","is it just me or has the art improved tremendously???like, wow. the perspective shifts,the style in which the fables were drawn, yoo sangah's expressions, the atmosphere.."
89,"Mar 2, 2022",this man???? is so smart?? holy shit
89,"Jan 26, 2022",why are the constellation even surprised at this point
89,"Mar 2, 2022",she's surprised that people know about her when she's married to dionysus? the god of alcohol? in a country that basically worships that shit?
89,"Mar 2, 2022","Yoo Jonghyuk: I swing both ways. //Yoo Jonghyuk: Violently. With a sword. Come get some, motherf*ckers."
89,"Jan 26, 2022",Bruh he pulled a should’ve been a LN reader on her
89,"Mar 2, 2022","the three question exchange is a cool idea, also love the way they illustrated it "
89,"Mar 2, 2022","Damn Ariadne you really aren’t the sharpest tool in the shed awareness-wise, huh? Girl, you were a human too, don’t look down on the rest when you haven’t even bothered to keep up with how globalization changed the cultural landscape."
89,"Mar 2, 2022","aaaaaa it's Dokja's very first Three Questions exchange!!!!!!! one of my favorite parts in the novel!!!! one of his first acts of antagonizing the constellations!!!!!! the art in this chapter really did the scene justice. every single panel is wallpaper worthy, and Ariadne's speech bubbles are my absolute favorite parts!!!! this chapter had me flapping my hands around like a fool :DD"
89,"Mar 3, 2022",Astronomy fun fact a singularity is the point at which the universe starts from i.e. the big bang started as a singularity
89,"Mar 2, 2022",boy. this need to be a show.
89,"Mar 2, 2022","Some days I'm like ""WHOA, DOKJA, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU COME UP WITH NEXT"" while other days (like today) I'm just like ""Somebody give this FABULOUS man a break. He deserves it."""
89,"Jan 26, 2022",My bet's on Dokja not choosing a Constellation during the next Sponsor Selection
89,"Mar 2, 2022","The flow of the stars will gather into one place? If I'm understanding those words right, then that's already begun. All kinds of different constellations from different worlds have gathered in Bihyeong's channel. So this event will happen when every constellation will come to watch Dokja. If that's what will happen, then the story is deviating much more from TWSA. I don't know if this happened in TWSA, but if it didn't, then it's happening because of Dokja's actions."
89,"Mar 2, 2022",the world building in orv is amazing. im enjoying this webtoon soo much
89,"Mar 2, 2022","Oh Olympus, I really hate you all (not including the underworld of course) "
89,"Mar 3, 2022","The Gods of the other dimension essentially told Ariadne to quiet down when they roared the first time and at the end essentially told her “Keep that racket down!” when they smacked her with lightning, Plausibility Storms might give Zeus a run for his money also if Dokja did pick any constellations It’d probably either be Sun Wukong/Prisoner of the Golden Headband or Uriel/Demonic Judge of Fire, they have been with him the longest, I’d add Secretive Plotter but he’s an enigma even to Dokja"
89,"Mar 2, 2022",Sing shong is rlly a goat giving us foreshadowings here and there
89,"Mar 2, 2022",I love the way they depicted the 3 questions especially since it was such a tense part of the novel
89,"Mar 2, 2022",Dude that was hype. Dokja using the questions to his full advantage was awesome. 
89,"Mar 2, 2022","""how does he know about my fable?!""*shows some general knowledge of western mythology in an hyper connected world where people can kinda know what's going across the world*"
89,"Mar 2, 2022","Okay I need to brush up on my Greek myths, Ariadne is married??"
89,"Mar 3, 2022","wouldnt this count as well lmaoo —> Ariadne: Who are you?  Dokja: Hi Im Kim Dokja, in my 20s, was a salaryman, nice to meet you 🤝"
89,"Mar 2, 2022",Dokja is so intelligent omg 😭 
89,"Mar 2, 2022",a mere puppet you say? no hes the main character lmao
89,"Mar 2, 2022",I call bs every time it's said that Korea is a small country. My place is 40x smaller and I know about Ariadne as well! Their logic is so off.
89,"Mar 2, 2022","'how can a human from this tiny country know about my fable?' easy, They read Percy Jackson."
89,"Mar 2, 2022",Why Do I Think ( A Constellation Who Doesnt Want The Excitement To Stop ) Is A Way For The Author To Insert A Freddy Mercury Cameo
89,"Mar 2, 2022",SPEAKING OF ORV LIVE ACTION. WHEN WILL THAT RELEASE OH MY GOD
89,"Mar 2, 2022","I swear, ORV finally make its way to become my standard when it comes to a story like this."
89,"Feb 26, 2022",my free 5 coins is worth it
89,"May 9, 2022",Sangah is hot
89,"Mar 9, 2022",Can someone tell me where I can purchase the novel in Europe?
89,"Mar 3, 2022",Wow that was crazy! Seeing Dokja in this intense moment with the constellation is why Omniscient Reader is my favorite webtoon right now 👍🔥
89,"Mar 3, 2022",I think she almost disclosed too much and the rule of plausibility was what zapped her
89,"Mar 2, 2022",HAPPY NEW YEAAAARRRRR AAAAHHHHH
89,"Mar 2, 2022",This story made me finish all the books and stories I read. Might use the knowledge someday.
89,"Mar 2, 2022",Shes okay right?
89,"Jan 26, 2022",Well that was anticlimactic.... save for the random lighting that interrupted the Goddess mid-sentence
89,"Mar 2, 2022","I'm confused about Ariadne's last question. ""how did you know we were watching you"" is not answered by ""I know your mythology"". Was it a play to get her to admit not wanting to hear more? In other words, being satisfied by the answer? "
89,"Mar 2, 2022",damn they're so sure sangah is this lynchpin to fate but dokja changed her fateful demise though? lol fate be fickle
89,"Mar 13, 2022","1. The constellation speech bubbles r really cool, like woah... pretty... 2. “Olympus really does blame everything on fate” Greek mythology in a nut shell, at least from what I know"
89,"Mar 8, 2022","instead of the people telling to search random YouTubers i suggest you to take an actual book about the subject, ya know one that has been verified as legit historical source. either that o some papers of mythography or directly the illiad and odyssey which are the greatest and most known written source of Greek mythical knowledge "
89,"Mar 4, 2022",It’s been a while since I’ve read an episode from this webtoon so I kinda forget what some stuff means. Can anyone explain to me what plausibility is again??
89,"Mar 3, 2022","when you talk too much, you get stuck by lightning."
89,"Mar 3, 2022",If i could just read all of it know😑
89,"Mar 3, 2022",did she said too much?
89,"Mar 3, 2022",This reminded me but I want to know what Pluto actually looks like
89,"Mar 3, 2022",interesting
89,"Mar 3, 2022",this episode in a nutshell: Dramatic talking 🤣🤣🤣
89,"Mar 3, 2022",God I really need to pay a lot of attention in this WEBTOON and reread read panels so many times cuz I don’t wanna miss anything. I get confused a lot. So much detail. I love this WEBTOON!
89,"Mar 3, 2022","Poor Sangha, turned into a weapon :(.   Wukong is still great though"
89,"Mar 3, 2022","""How can a human from a tiny country know about [Greek] fables?"" Because the West likes to throw its culture around."
89,"Mar 2, 2022","As a greek citizen i confirm. Yes, olympos really does blame everything to fate"
89,"Mar 2, 2022",man I'm addicted to possessed ssngah
89,"Mar 2, 2022",natsumi and cheese are yall here 
89,"Mar 2, 2022",The art….omg. It is so dang good. The lighting on Sangha’s face in those later panels. And the coloring. So good. 
89,"Mar 2, 2022",HOLY HELL THE ART IS SO GOOD; AND SANGAH LOOKED ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
89,"Mar 2, 2022","""prisoner of the Golden headband"" we  Choose you"
89,"Mar 2, 2022",Ope! I hope Sangha is okay 😬
89,"Mar 2, 2022","haha prisoner of the golden headband.. you belong in one piece, you cant hog all the stories.."
89,"Feb 26, 2022",The dialogue bubbles for Ariadne were so pretty 
89,"Jan 27, 2022","Eden is in the book of Genesis, not Revelation. Revelation contains the description of the city of God and mentions the new heaven and new Earth."
89,"Mar 2, 2022",poor sangah being electrocuted just because ariadne is chatty... I really hope sangah will be set free in the end ^^
89,"Mar 2, 2022",I like the censored reference to Omniscient Reader 😂
89,"Mar 2, 2022",PJO fans must be lovin' this episode. I know I am heheh
89,"Mar 2, 2022",damn the lady makes Sangah hot 🔥
89,"Mar 2, 2022",not the good time buT SANGAH LOOKS SO HOTT EIEHESKBESLJSKS
89,"Mar 2, 2022",cries.. Sangah looks so pretty
89,"Sep 21, 2022",Olympus with a second O is weird to read.
89,"May 27, 2022",Ahh I'm so curious about Sangah's role in this all >.<
89,"Mar 12, 2022",This chapter reminded of how much i hate Zeus
89,"Mar 9, 2022",CHAPTER 97 UPDATED LAST NIGHT OH GOD. I'M NOT EARLY ANYMORE
89,"Mar 8, 2022",I've never felt this excited reading a manhwa after so long 🤩 literally catching up to the latest ep in two days
89,"Mar 4, 2022","I am fr fr in awe rn, the series progresses so good😩😩😩 thank you for making this series"
89,"Mar 4, 2022",I just binged this because I've been behind oh my god this is so amazing. 
89,"Mar 4, 2022",Really liked how they portrayed 'Three Divine questions'
89,"Mar 3, 2022",Zeus that bastard took over 
89,"Mar 3, 2022","Zeus said nah bro, I like this guy. Also. man are the lightning and sky effects so pretty this chapter. And bold badass Sangah."
89,"Mar 3, 2022","wukong-ah, dont hope too much 🙄 you should rather start a healthy hair routine because you will soon lose a big amount because of your maknae 😔 "
89,"Mar 3, 2022","Huh, I was learning some mythology recently. Kinda surprised, but also not, about the story of Theseus taking such a turn. Coincidence? I think not."
89,"Mar 3, 2022","Chapters like this really make me appreciate how flushed out the lore of this comic that started out with the classic, “gore and overpowered mc slasher” feel"
89,"Mar 3, 2022","I find it a bit weird how Korean media always seems to put down Korea as a ""tiny country"". My country is much smaller, but we only bring it up if it's relevant."
89,"Mar 3, 2022",Can someone explain to me what plausibility and ssignularities are in context of this comic?
89,"Mar 3, 2022","[Constellation ""Herald of the Black Dawn"" digs in her wallet for coins but comes up short.]"
89,"Mar 3, 2022","Guys,  I would love to read the novel but I can't find it anywhere... can anybody help me ? thanks from France ❤"
89,"Mar 2, 2022",HAPPY NEW YEAARRR AAAAAHHHH
89,"Mar 2, 2022",For like the first time ever I'm glad to see a snippet of spoiler saying that the LN this story is adapted from is very long. Makes me excited to see what comes next! And it means I'll have this story to look forward to reading for a long time! :)
89,"Mar 2, 2022","been reading this from the 1st ep, i love this webtoon"
89,"Mar 2, 2022",<GIGANTOMACHIA>
89,"Mar 2, 2022","It's a shame he didn't manage to bait out her refusal early, like she did with his. But then...the story wouldn't be as fun if we knew what was going to happen."
89,"Mar 2, 2022","I know a bit about Greek myth. is she the woman who had sex with a bull and created the minotaur, or someone else? Edit: She helped Theseus get through the Labrinth, got abandoned on that island, and became the wife? of Dionysus, Fabled creator of wine and most commonly known as a party god. (Overly sarcastic productions made a great video about him)"
89,"Mar 2, 2022","I mean, the greek mythology is popular all around the world for avid readers, I'm Canadian and I know about her fable."
89,"Mar 2, 2022","heh… be happy while you can, the sad arcs are coming"
89,"Feb 25, 2022","Olympus getting involve is something to worry about, given that the greek gods history as well as their arrogance and pride can also be self destructive. I hope dokja will be ready when that moment comes with all the stars gathered in one place."
89,"Feb 24, 2022",earlier chapters mentioned how Sangah was using techniques that didnt belong to Ariadne. interesting
89,"Jan 27, 2022",Why did nobody read TWSA? It must’ve been a great read considering everything went into so much depth. So far it sounds like the story had constant action but also had a clear storyline with great character development.
89,"Mar 2, 2022","The gods really said ""bitch shut the hell up you're talking too much"" 🤣🤣🤣"
89,"Mar 2, 2022",I think this is one of the few webtoons that will make readers go read from the start as soon as it finished. So many things become clear once you finish it!
89,"Mar 2, 2022",SPOILER ALERT got CRUSHED BY THUNDER lolololol rofl
89,"Sep 22, 2022","Lmfaoo Wukong: ""WUUUKONG! WUUUKONG! WUUUKONG!"" is fucking amazing 🤣🤣🤣"

89,"Mar 2, 2022","hey ! can someone explain what the « rules of plausibility » is exactly ? i have a really hard time understanding what it means, and how it can affect their choices…"
89,"Mar 2, 2022",Roasted spider :')
89,"Mar 2, 2022",All I can say is that the art is STUNNING 
89,"Mar 2, 2022",I stg if he chooses the freaking Minotaur as his constellation I will be so angry
89,"Mar 2, 2022",That last panel I laughed-
89,"Jan 28, 2022",Am I supposed to read the end of the chapter as Zeus telling Ariadne to zip it? 
89,"Jan 26, 2022",3 Questions Game was cool 😆 
89,"Mar 4, 2022",Me wishing the “main character” and the main character are lovers god I wish this was a BL. 😩
89,"Mar 2, 2022",what SHOCKING turn of events 
89,"Mar 2, 2022","Oh man, here we go with this ""mere human"" discrimination again 🙄. For a puppet that's doing whatever the sisters of fate tell her, she's sure trying to act all high and mighty"
89,"Mar 2, 2022",looks like Zeus didn't like that
89,"Mar 2, 2022","wow, what an electrifying exchange! I love how she was shocked with every answer. there's a ton of buzz for watt happens next! I can't wait for what's next."
89,"Mar 2, 2022","A brief summary of the myths of Ariadne: She was the daughter of Minos, and shared a common mother with the half-man half-bull, 'Minotaur'. Her father has left her in charge of the Cretan Labyrinth where humans would be sacrificed to the minotaur inside. But Ariadne fell in love with the demigod Theseus, and helped him defeat the minotaur instead."
89,"Mar 2, 2022","""You are mere puppet""as novel reader i want to laugh a little 😅"
89,"Mar 2, 2022",Every time I see someone get struck by lightning I always think of “strike me down Zeus. You don’t have the ba-“
89,"Jan 26, 2022",I miss bug kid
89,"Sep 30, 2022","The last time I said “I like reading”, I was considered a nerd.
Glad to see reading is more popular now, at least for adults."
89,"Sep 23, 2022",silly Olympia gods. humans have become very knowledgeable since your age of glory
89,"Aug 11, 2022",When I was reading this part in the LN I didn't even know what the hell's coming like fr the plot is INTENSELY PACKED N THICCC
89,"Jul 30, 2022","""Prisoner of golden headband is chanting his nickname"" if I'm Dokja I will choose this guy"
89,"Jul 20, 2022","Lol I forgot to give a like to all the episodes I've read up until now. From episode 1 to this episode, episode 88. So I went back to the first episode and give it a like, from episode 1 to episode 88. I'm glad I did. 🤠🤠"
89,"Jun 10, 2022",Zeus literally said: no.

89,"Jun 4, 2022","WHY IS IT ALWAYS THE INBRED, RAPIST, VICTOM BLAMING, BITCHES OF OLYPUS!?!!"
89,"May 22, 2022",so dokja is the new Percy Jackson with an oracle 😂
89,"May 14, 2022","Hey does anyone remember what plausibility is, and if so, explain it to me? It’s been a while since I’ve read this webtoon lol"
89,"May 14, 2022",Sounds to me like all of the constellations will end up in one channel. 
89,"May 9, 2022",this was a really intense episode. it seems like we'll be getting a LOT of important information in the next chapters.
89,"May 8, 2022",This is the power of libraries 
89,"May 5, 2022",waaah sangahs body is being fried?! I suppose maybe just the constellations
89,"Apr 23, 2022",bye i love prisoner of the golden headband like i feel like they’ve just been loyal to dokja this whole time and i rlly want them to be the chosen constellation
89,"Apr 9, 2022",so we all definitely know prisoner of the golden headband is The Monkey King right
89,"Apr 7, 2022",Did this btch really not know that Greek Mythology can be known around the world?
89,"Apr 2, 2022","Doja the kinda guy to walk into an argument with a ""but that's just me"" line"
89,"Apr 2, 2022","This chapter and portion of the storyline just kicked up the excitement / depth to the story 10 notches, and it was already amazing!   plus, the art ...*chef's kiss*"
89,"Mar 21, 2022",Gigantomachia is the battle between the gods of olympus and the giants so my guess is that the humans will wnd up rebelling against the gods themselves 
89,"Mar 13, 2022",Man Dokja reads a lot and is super smart. Also did Zeus get mad lol
89,"Mar 10, 2022","He could have said that ""I have read it on webtoon"""
89,"Mar 10, 2022",I’m wondering where the rest of the crew is? 🤔😒
89,"Mar 9, 2022","""How does such a small island to the East know of us?!"" ....Google???"

89,"Mar 3, 2022","Weird that the gods of Olympus wouldn’t be so arrogant to think themselves known far and wide, their egos tend to consume them. On top of that, if they’ve kept up with human history at all, which I can’t imagine what they’ve been doing if none of them have ever occasionally glanced at us (especially with their history), they ought to know that they are pretty popular as the basis for a lot of pop culture in books and film. Also strange to consider Korea small other than in terms of land mass."

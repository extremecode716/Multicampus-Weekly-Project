Episode,Date,Review
71,"Sep 22, 2021",He indeed was mad enough to read all of TWSA and it did him well
71,"Sep 22, 2021",His attribute is “Absolute Madman”
71,"Sep 22, 2021","Ouch, here I thought the system confirmed she would have gotten them all killed as an epic burn before clarification. Meanwhile more of his past is about to be explored and from the looks that guy in it was a shitty Bully."
71,"Sep 22, 2021","my theory is that during that flashback when he was bullying our ever so loveable mc,this werewolf guy took his phone and saw chapter 173which is why her skill says ""he's only read chapter 173"""
71,"Sep 22, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" is excited for the upcoming juicy backstory.][The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" finds the incarnation ""HSY"" interesting.] [5 coins have been sponsored. ]"
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Dokja in a suit does things to me 
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Haha she doesn’t even know the half of it. He could literally explain the entire future right now if he chose to. Also why are they always werewolves when there are so many better options. Like why does nobody ever go for the human sized praying mantis and just go ham on everyone and everything 
71,"Sep 22, 2021",i love how the other bg furry got normal colored fur and then there's minu
71,"Sep 22, 2021","How long are these days, because I have yet to see this man eat a single meal or sleep a single hour"
71,"Sep 22, 2021",I Think I'm Reading These Chapters Too Fast....
71,"Sep 22, 2021",I don't know about you all but I'm completely distracted by Dokja in a suit hahahaha 
71,"Sep 22, 2021",aw they trimmed the bully's name. it's Song Minwoo. I was half expecting Sung Jinwoo memes in the comments lol
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Why does she always wait to ask the important questions 😭
71,"Sep 22, 2021","So he bullied our protagonist and ended up reading the chapter that he was on, making it the only chapter he ever read. "
71,"Sep 22, 2021",that is one weird looking dog
71,"Sep 24, 2021","uh oh, Minu messed up. Being a werewolf means Dokja is free to kill him "
71,"Sep 22, 2021",he read one chapter and only cause he was bullying dokja and stole his phone would be my guess
71,"Sep 22, 2021",either I read this too fast or this chapter was shorter 
71,"Sep 22, 2021",It’s fun to read that TWSA is crap in their world but we pay to read this masterpiece.
71,"Sep 22, 2021",savoring the iv drip rate theyre revealing dokja's angst past at 🤲🤲
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Is it just me or do y’all also wanna beat the guy who bullied Kdj too? I mean Kdj was finally happy(in the apocalypse)and now this guy shows up
71,"Sep 22, 2021",that awkward moment when you don't even know how your own ability works
71,"Sep 22, 2021","Also, hello early fast passers "
71,"Oct 27, 2021",KDJ: Han Sooyoung was born April 1st the day all jokes were made__________________________________________ HSY: Kim Dokja was born February 15th one day away from someone actually loving him
71,"Sep 22, 2021",ohhh I really like what they did for the werewolf design! Also I can smell some trauma incoming 
71,"Sep 22, 2021","So that guy bullied Dokja... Wanna punch him now, anyone with me? "
71,"Sep 25, 2021","You know I’m happy that Dokja hasn’t killed anyone.. until now, I hate bullies and I already hate him "
71,"Nov 2, 2021","Kim Dokja: You remind me of the ocean  // 
Yoo Jonghyuk: Because I'm deep and mysterious? // 
Kim Dokja: No, because you're salty and you scare 
people."
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Well altough we got interesting developments this felt so short 🥲
71,"Sep 22, 2021",That chapter was too short 😮‍💨🤌🏽
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Short chapter 😭😭
71,"Oct 28, 2021",Oh I've been noticing the drop in the number of likes since a while now but this chapter really had a significant decrease in likes. I remind you all to like the chapters to support the author who is blessing us with such amazing content. thanks :) <3
71,"Oct 27, 2021","I legit thought it was gonna say, ""They're FURRIES!"""
71,"Oct 28, 2021","He must’ve only read chapter 173 because he was looking over Dokja’s shoulder. ALSO, can we talk about how in another story, I could see the plagiarist being the main character? She makes a deal with a powerful and mysterious person who saves her and shatters what conventions she knew about the world when he answers her questions. I think that’s pretty dope and I can’t wait to see more!"
71,"Oct 27, 2021",Their next opponent…is a furry 
71,"Sep 22, 2021","are these chapters getting shorter or am I reading them too fast, I want more please"
71,"Oct 27, 2021",Dojka was able to beat up junghyeok I think he'll be fine but then again trauma
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Ah I love seeing HSY and KDJ bicker and work together at the same time
71,"Oct 28, 2021",I can't wait for the confront your bully scenario 😆
71,"Oct 14, 2021",Dokja gets to have a trauma flashback because it's a bully. And I'm hoping the humanoid demons don't count as humans anymore. Dokja deserves some moments of very glance for his suffering.
71,"Sep 23, 2021",Minu Song used *high school trauma*! It was super effective!
71,"Oct 29, 2021","Interviewer, going over HSY's resume: Okay, so right here, it states that you’re creative. __________________________ Han Sooyoung: Yes _______________________________________________________________________  Interviewer: Okay... may I know what you create? _______________________________________________________ Han Sooyoung: Problems."
71,"Oct 27, 2021","...I did not expect anyone from Dokja's past to show up.. I'm guessing all those flashbacks are actually going to be plot relevant in the future. And that guy probably saw the chapter off of Dokja's phone, if he ever forcibly took it."
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Just read a year’s content of this webtoon in less than 12 hours. Now I’m too invested and broke! Can’t wait for next week.
71,"Nov 3, 2021",he read it when he stole dokja's phone.. to make fun of what he was reading...didn't he...
71,"Oct 28, 2021","guys I just learned the definition of omniscient in my English class, I get the connection between the story and the title now 😭"
71,"Oct 28, 2021",former bully haracters tend not to last very long
71,"Oct 27, 2021",Dokja’s the type of person who’d you play 20 questions with but somehow you only get 6
71,"Oct 27, 2021","Quick reminder there is 3,149 chapters in TWSA."
71,"Oct 27, 2021",the suspenders look looks great on dokja
71,"Oct 27, 2021","Out of everything I've read (which is of a considerable amount) I have to say that this is my favorite piece of literature. It almost puts everything to shame, every single book, every single series, and even other webcomics. This is how you tell a story, and I'm loving every single second of reading it. Simply phenomenal"
71,"Oct 27, 2021","Imagine.. some random dude, reading some random chapter of a novel and randomly able to survive an apocalypse. Such coincidence, if it's not a plot armor.."
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Kind of funny I never put much thought into what his attribute was even though it was right in front of me every time I read. Omniscient means having infinite understanding and awareness which would explain why he can block scans and mimic others abilities. 
71,"Sep 22, 2021",This is for sure one of the best webtoons. Looking forward to the next chapter!!
71,"Oct 29, 2021",So since Minu & the other grey one “gave up their humanity” to become this walking wolf thing... they’re not human...? Meaning Dokja can kill them without losing king of no killing? 
71,"Oct 28, 2021",and ppl say reading is stupid
71,"Oct 28, 2021","This is literally a story where wasting your time reading stories all the way to the end actually helps you gain applicable skills to survive the apocalypse!
I love it!!"
71,"Oct 28, 2021",I hope Dokja will be ok facing Minu Song again. It seems like Dokja might have developed a fear or maybe trauma from this dude.
71,"Oct 27, 2021","I think we need to start putting some actual consideration into the idea that the original story of TWSA was not a 'good' piece of media. I used to assume the plot point of its reader base plummeting to 1 was more just a narrative flair for Omniscient's concept, but between the things being hinted about Dokja's family and past, the way it's been hinted the comments sections were passed Chapter 50 when it was just the Disciples left, and now Suyeong's comment"
71,"Oct 22, 2021",Dokja just ultra flexed by not answering the 4th question. It's funny how silence can be seen as an answer as well
71,"Sep 23, 2021",can we all agree that this is about to get spicy with either a fight scene or backstory
71,"Sep 22, 2021","I was under the impression that him reading all of it is what allowed it to come to his world. so really, he kinda screwed everyone."
71,"Sep 22, 2021",I wonder how long it’ll take Suyeong Han to realize Minu Song only read chapter 173 because he saw it over Dokja’s shoulder in that bullying flashback
71,"Oct 29, 2021","""only read chapter 173"" bcs he read it from dokjas phone while bullying him huh..."
71,"Oct 27, 2021",I think Dojika has trauma related to that fellow that looks like a bully I mean look at his face
71,"Oct 22, 2021",This series is so adictive that I spent my whole free day to binge read it to this chapter. Now I need more coins lmao
71,"Sep 22, 2021",it's not everyday you get to fight your ptsd on a game
71,"Oct 29, 2021",Here appreciating Dokja on suit and tie 😄✌
71,"Oct 28, 2021","Wait, he only read one chapter and became a furry?   A strong one at that too.  So boss.  "
71,"Oct 28, 2021","Wait, he only read one chapter? Why that one chapter? WHO DOES THAT?!"
71,"Oct 28, 2021",imagine having a fight in the comment section of TWSA and meeting them here💀
71,"Oct 27, 2021",Chance for revenge on a bully who is now a humanoid monster that kills people that seems to be out to kill him for real this time only he can't kill to defend because of his no-kill pledge skill. :| That plagiarizing author better help him out.
71,"Sep 23, 2021","Noooo, all these coins spent to try and pass the cliff hangers and it just keeps going"
71,"Oct 27, 2021",i bet he read the chapter bc he was bullying dokja and dokja happened to be on that chapter and he saw it on his phone or something
71,"Sep 22, 2021","As interesting as this is, after what Dokja did to Junghyeok if he's triggered into trauma mode and gets wrecked I'll be upset. Dude probably has the same amount of coin he spent earlier to achieve 100 strength and amp his stats to flatten this dude."
71,"Nov 16, 2021",oh nice you can be a furry in this game 
71,"Oct 29, 2021","Yoo Jonghyuk: When someone points at your black clothes and asks whose funeral it is, having a look around the room and saying 'Haven't decided yet' is typically a good response."
71,"Oct 29, 2021",wtf are all the bots in the comments lol
71,"Oct 29, 2021",[An unknown constellation couldn’t help but laugh at how the werewolf look like and says it look like those dragons used in festivals]
71,"Oct 28, 2021","Man, he can’t even escape his bully in TWSA 😫"
71,"Oct 28, 2021","Ah yes that one post about Kim Dokja's name being webtoon translated to 'Hank'- you know, like when webtoon translates characters' names into English equivalents (like in Weak Hero). Imagine just everyone calling Dokja 'Hank' lol"
71,"Oct 28, 2021",THE CHARACTER DESIGN IS AMAZING LIKE LOOK AT THOSE EYES
71,"Oct 27, 2021","Lol it felt like Dokja would have taken that moment to roast her, letting her get repeated messages confirming that he is telling the truth"
71,"Oct 27, 2021",I love the demons designs!
71,"Oct 27, 2021","he should have said ""your hair is blonde"" to show her that her lie detection wasn't broken"
71,"Oct 27, 2021","ew minu song… ok but anyways, can we talk about how hot kdj and hsy looked this whole chapter? "
71,"Oct 27, 2021",Lol it’s a furry
71,"Sep 25, 2021","Current chapter : 70 Current coins : 0 
Current mood : I regret NOTHING!!! "
71,"Oct 29, 2021",whats the bet he only read chpater 173 because he was reading over dokjas shoulder
71,"Oct 28, 2021",I feel like “you read all of TWSA??” has the same energy as “you read all of tog?” Or “you watched all of once piece/mha?!”
71,"Oct 28, 2021",can i get 1 order of revenge on high school bully please! Coming right up
71,"Oct 28, 2021",the fact that some people gave up being a human and decided to live on as a new species is so funny 😭 this minu dude looks really cool tho
71,"Oct 28, 2021","Is it just me or was this chapter much shorter than the regular length? Each episode usually consists of 90-120 panels, whereas, I believe this had only 52 panels. Not complaining though, every Wednesday is a ride for me thanks to this series!"
71,"Oct 28, 2021",he probably read the episode on the mc phone when he was bullying him
71,"Oct 28, 2021","Poor Dokja, he's traumatized. "
71,"Oct 27, 2021",He can't kill humans. Glad he's not human ig? That way Dokja can torment and kill him :)
71,"Oct 27, 2021",Well shit. And somebody tell me is dokja not a renouncer and reader? am I right? 
71,"Oct 27, 2021",Wow this webtoon keeps getting more and more interesting with the humans becoming monsters 👍
71,"Oct 27, 2021","now that I'm re-reading this, I realize it kinda makes more sense (on a whole another level) why or how hsy have an ability to knows about the renouncers of twsa and at which chapter they stop reading"
71,"Oct 27, 2021",So this is a easy one. Minu is Dokjas old bully and The only chapter he read was because he likely took his Phone and read it out loud to mock Dokja. Is my guess
71,"Oct 27, 2021",I'm glad Dokja gave her the chance to ask actual questions. Instead of answering the rhetorical questions she asked
71,"Oct 27, 2021","Have to eat 3 meals a day, huh.  Looks like wolf-boy would make a few sandwiches."
71,"Sep 24, 2021","This webtoon is so incredible I read the entire thing in one night, including every fast pass. I am in love with this story and it breaks my heart that I have to wait for more!!"
71,"Sep 22, 2021","I’m gonna bet he’s some bully, and the one chapter is likely him stealing Dokja’s phone, and reading what he was reading to embarrass him or something"
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Since Dokja knows this guy pretty well will he be able to use his bookmark at a better understanding than the previous ones?
71,"Sep 22, 2021",minu must’ve read one really intense chapter
71,"Nov 24, 2021","""My Favourite Web Novel Became a Reality Where My Former Bully is a Furry Trying to Kill Me"""
71,"Oct 30, 2021",a bully turning into a monster? I'm not even surprised. now I'm curious as to how much that bully affect Dokja. well he still be paralyzed looking at his bully due to the trauma?
71,"Oct 28, 2021",He read that chapter over Dokja's shoulder? 
71,"Oct 28, 2021",Distracted with KDJ wearing suit
71,"Oct 28, 2021","A chance to stand up to his old bully,  lovely... 😏"
71,"Oct 28, 2021",the art is so good... i love how they drew n coloured minu song as a humanoid demon
71,"Oct 28, 2021",comment to help numbers grow. I've done my part
71,"Oct 28, 2021",now he's fighting a big ass furry
71,"Oct 28, 2021",I wish this was an anime.
71,"Oct 27, 2021",Now we have furries. Excellent!
71,"Oct 27, 2021","Must be a bully who took his phone, looked at the Webtoon our MC read, then gave him shit for it."
71,"Oct 27, 2021","The character design for the humanoid demon is 10/10 omg! Also, too bad Dokja can't kill that bully but I hope he beats him up 😤"
71,"Oct 27, 2021",oH- so he peeked at the chapter from dokja and thanks to that now he's a humanoid demon? nice 😀
71,"Oct 27, 2021",I reckon he's only read one chapter while bullying our main character.
71,"Oct 27, 2021",Oh no looks like we'll be opening dokjas past :(
71,"Oct 27, 2021",He actually answered four questions.
71,"Oct 27, 2021","Ah yes, more trauma for Kim Dokja"
71,"Oct 27, 2021",is not a korean webtoon if a bully doesn't appear as threat for the MC
71,"Oct 27, 2021",I guess he only read one chapter bcs it's whatever he picked up while bullying Dokja
71,"Oct 27, 2021",love how he bullied him for reading twisa when he read it to
71,"Oct 27, 2021",His attribute is NOYB - None of your BUSINESS. Oh noooo the bully has entered. 
71,"Oct 27, 2021",Dojka... you answered way more questions than you should have
71,"Sep 25, 2021",I am so freakin pumped!!!
71,"Sep 23, 2021",Oh god…DOKJA BEAT HIS ASS PLEASE BEAT THIS INCINEROAR LOOKINH ASS MF
71,"Sep 22, 2021",I'm certain I'm not a fast reader.. This chapter just didn't have much dialogues. That explains it.
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Humanoid demons = furries. Got it.
71,"Oct 28, 2021",FURRY
71,"Nov 8, 2021",the world f*****g ENDED and dis b*tch became a damn f u r r y ? ? ?
71,"Nov 5, 2021",….furries…..
71,"Nov 4, 2021","I swear my thoughts while reading this were: ""They're not characters?? They're...   furries?"""
71,"Nov 4, 2021",I bet he read that chapter because Dokja was reading it during a time when he was abusing him. I hope Dokja can stand up to his former bully.
71,"Nov 3, 2021",all bullies are some kind of monster but this one took literally is a monster 
71,"Nov 2, 2021",that werewolf is dead
71,"Nov 2, 2021","yjh, running into kdj at chungmuro: you seem familiar. have i threatened you before? "
71,"Nov 2, 2021","HSY: What? I'm not aggressive! //KDJ: Last Tuesday, you wacked me with a pair of crocs and stole my chocolate chips? //
HSY: Survival of the fittest, bitch."
71,"Nov 2, 2021","Everyone trying to grab the phone charger out of Dokja's hand /// 
Dokja: Alright, that’s it! Start the betting! //
Lee Hyunsung: 95% //
Jung Huiwon: 40% //
Han Sooyoung: 10% //
Lee Jihye: 5% (she's lying) //
Dokja, shows phone: Dead. And if I can't use it, I'm going to die. //
Han Sooyoung, whispering: Don't you always die anyway //
Dokja, raising his voice: We're all going to die next scenario if I can't use my phone."
71,"Oct 30, 2021","Han Sooyoung: Do you know that we are made out of atoms? _____________________________________________ Han Sooyoung: And atoms never touch each other.________________________________________________________ Han Sooyoung: So in my defense, officer. I did not punch this kid."
71,"Oct 30, 2021",Han Sooyoung: Why did you guys dress up as each other for Halloween? _______________________________________ Kim Dokja: YJH is the scariest thing I could think of!_____________________________________________________ Yoo Jonghyuk: KDJ told me I should pick the dumbest costume possible.

71,"Oct 29, 2021",humanoid demon? hes basically just a bipedal wolf
71,"Oct 29, 2021",That minu song guy probably read one chapter over dokjas shoulder before beating him up
71,"Oct 28, 2021",... IS THIS DOKJA'S BULLY!?!?
71,"Oct 28, 2021",Oh boy... Are we getting BACKSTORY?! 
71,"Oct 28, 2021","I'm curious if the the novel is better, this is amazing so far"
71,"Oct 28, 2021","Honestly, the most unbelievable thing in this webtoon is that he was the only one to read until the end. If the webtoon was anywhere near as good quality as this one, there would have been more xD "
71,"Oct 28, 2021",The goddamn bully omg I hate him so much 
71,"Oct 28, 2021","Man, what a way to meet an old enemy again. I hope Dokja can get out if this pretty much unscathed."
71,"Oct 28, 2021","so i think this guy is someone dokja may have talked to about the novel he liked reading, and told him a bit about chapter 173 before he realized he was being made fun of. If I am right, then that means just one chapter can give you the title of renouncer. Thats crazy"
71,"Oct 28, 2021",Why is the werewolf (liondog?) hot this is messed up 
71,"Oct 28, 2021",Ok I will take a min to appreciate the artist like the art is just so FINE!~🥴😖❤Oh is it just me or the wolf looked terrifying😨
71,"Oct 28, 2021","that trauma expression on Dokaja's face is sad somehow, he suffered a lot in his life and yet this stupid looking dog is here again, i hope he'll take a revenge on him( even though he can't kill him himself)."
71,"Oct 28, 2021",since minu song isnt a character i wonder how kdj will react here
71,"Oct 27, 2021",well damn the bully is about to get killed. 
71,"Oct 27, 2021",he only found them cuz she couldn't whisper
71,"Oct 27, 2021",I’m not a furry- BUT DAMNN 
71,"Oct 27, 2021",Ready people! We get to look at Kim Dokja's past! 
71,"Oct 27, 2021","hsy is like one of those people that have a devil n an angel on their 
shoulders only the devil is telling her to 
go on a mass murdering spree and the 
angel is telling her to be a bully and 
spend her money in the most 
hedonistic ways she can find that's 
why she ended up where she was 
when she was the first apostle"
71,"Oct 27, 2021",Fun fact: I’m pretty sure Minwoo’s wolf coloring is based off Korean mythology!
71,"Oct 27, 2021",I wonder who wrote TWSA to begin with?
71,"Oct 27, 2021","Dude they turned into furries 
Life goals "
71,"Oct 27, 2021",Peace or Chaos Anime checks  his surroundings to check for more panels and chapters.
71,"Oct 27, 2021",omg so that's what the wolves look like omg I was imagining something completely different lmao 
71,"Oct 27, 2021",D O K J A. K I M.
71,"Oct 27, 2021","Bullying someone who reads the same novel as you? Wow, insecure much?"
71,"Oct 27, 2021","Read this before bed, now Minu Song will give me nightmares. 🥲"
71,"Oct 27, 2021",furrys???
71,"Oct 27, 2021","dokja's had such a cool face until now, now his face looks so traumatized when he meets the people he knew the bullies from past.... "
71,"Oct 27, 2021","I cannot wait for what's about to happen and be depicted. Hold onto your pants kids, prepare for mind blowing story building."
71,"Oct 27, 2021",ok but really tho isn't this guy already pretty good😐 why would he struggle against someone who's read only 1 chapter
71,"Oct 27, 2021",the long awaited *sswhooping is here
71,"Oct 27, 2021",Call me mad but I would have read all of  it too😌
71,"Oct 27, 2021",I think minu read while dokja read. Like stole his phone and saw everything 
71,"Oct 27, 2021",HOW was it that he knows that he was the only reader to read after chapter 50 but this dude has read up to 173? I don’t get it 
71,"Oct 21, 2021","Since Minu Song is no longer human, could this mean Dokja could kill him without consequence?"
71,"Sep 28, 2021",when the whole world turns into squid game
71,"Sep 24, 2021",it is so infuriating for me to sit through this knowing that this dude can literally get 100 on each Stat it would be Hella expensive but he CAN EASILY make all that coin back it would BARELY scratch his coin bank that sight of him being op AS HELL was wayyy too pleasing  he would also get a  ton for getting all stats to 100 😭like i bro just become insanely op like in the tournament I beg you 
71,"Sep 24, 2021",It’s funny to see how the bully was also reading TWSA since he’s a renouncer 🤔
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Ok maybe ive been reading too much of my gently raised beast but he’s kinda hot 
71,"Oct 27, 2021",so minsu has turned into a furry huh
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Why was this so short!!!. 😭. it went by way to quickly and as always it makes me wanna read more.
71,"Sep 22, 2021",A part of me wants them to stick together and part of me says it’s a bad idea. 
71,"Sep 20, 2022",When your bully turns into a furry. 😂🤣
71,"Jul 8, 2022",Great… now we have furries
71,"Mar 9, 2022","""They're not furries, they're humanoid demons!"" - Suyeong Han, probably "
71,"Nov 20, 2021",why is he colored like a chinese festival decoration

71,"Sep 29, 2021",I just wanted to ask if it’s worth it to buy the Taiwanese version of the physical book of this manhwa? I’m contemplating whether I should buy it or not. Thanks ^^
71,"Sep 22, 2021","Suyeong Han is really getting on my nerves...not as much as Myeongoh Han but still. That was such a short chapter, but I'm grateful. 
So Dokja's old bully was also reading twsa?? This will be interesting"
71,"Sep 22, 2021","I got bullied too. don’t stress it dokja, you already know your the bigger man"
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Great chapter 
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Jeeez!! This series has me on the edge of my seat!🤣
71,"Sep 22, 2021","Did she just call him mad for reading the whole novel? I mean, kind of, but no"
71,"Sep 22, 2021","Ahhh, I just keep wanting more! An episode dump in this would be AMAZING!"
71,"Sep 22, 2021","Werewolves, I guess even mythology makes its way in here"
71,"Sep 22, 2021",What a short feeling chapter. 😬
71,"Sep 22, 2021","So did anyone else go skim the 1st 3 chapters looking for the bully on the train?  I thought he looked familiar, but my search was to no avail.
Also, does anyone else miss the other characters from before the flag event began in earnest?  I do.  "
71,"Sep 22, 2021",We all knew when they mentioned a bully that he'd be back in the story.
71,"Sep 22, 2021","love the artwork! its just like how i saw the novel in my head.
 Thank you!!"
71,"Sep 22, 2021",And “only” read that chapter..
71,"Sep 22, 2021",humanoid demons sound cool but its outer species.
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Yo! We gonna see Dokja be unsure of himself!!!!! WE LOVE SEING THE CHANCE FOR CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!!! Beat the shit out of him!
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Wait is Dokja actually scared for once?
71,"Sep 22, 2021",ahh the cliffhanger
71,"Sep 22, 2021","He beat him up in the bathroom and accidentally read that single chapter, I'm calling it now."
71,"Oct 28, 2021","His attribute is ""Death fetish"". "
71,"Jul 10, 2022",trauma is coming now
71,"Oct 27, 2021",Nice doggy.... Good doggy.... 😅
71,"Oct 25, 2021",that update was too shortt--or did i just read it too fast anywyas all of my coins were greatly spent!!! 
71,"Sep 27, 2021","If you think about it, she has the exact opposite abilities than he does.. she can read the renouncers who've read the story and he can read the characters who haven't. I wonder if she can read the chick from his work who's been there since his first day in the apocalypse (I can't remember her name)"
71,"Sep 23, 2021",I try to hold myself back from reading Webtoons as soon as they update but with this one I juat can't help myself. It's simply too damn good!
71,"Sep 22, 2021","*Asks if he is a renouncer**Immediately explains that she has an ability that tells her who's a renouncer*
Just because someone acknowledges the redundancy in the action doesn't make it any less stupid. 
Otherwise a great chapter and I'm excited to see more of his past!"
71,"Sep 22, 2021",Either I’m a master speed reader or the story is just that good where it goes by too fast😭
71,"Oct 27, 2021",Anyone feel like this chapter was extremely short? It felt like I finished it very quickly.
71,"Aug 21, 2022","guys, i wonder what will happen to this old bully. and this guy smells like he's still a bully. not that all bullys still want to be bullys after a clarification on the shit they've already done. but I'm still stuck with that story. dokja and han in action!"
71,"Nov 12, 2021",commwnt number 1000 
71,"Oct 30, 2021","you know this story is very good and actually I've had being interested to this go
good story by the time they take to do this and the creativity of all the items abilities ect ps the rivaliti of dokja and the emo it's like the same as naruto and sasuke  XD 
"
71,"Oct 28, 2021",Why doesn't Dokja let her ask him an unlimited number of questions? He can guess anything about the world and the changes and she can confirm if they are true or not. Lie detection is way more powerful than what they are using it for.
71,"Oct 27, 2021",that chapter was Short as hell
71,"Oct 27, 2021",Is that a new girl for the harem I see???
71,"Sep 27, 2021","I wonder what the name of the attribute would be then, since Sujyeong is the last renouncer but this dude read a later chapter than she did "
71,"Sep 23, 2021",Dojka is really hot in that suit 💕

71,"Sep 22, 2021","Humanoid Demon, huh? If he's not human then Dokja can kill him. [The Constellation Lord of the Bleeding Wallet rubs his hands villainously.][5 coins have been gifted.]"

71,"Oct 27, 2021",Is it just me or was this chapter much shorter than usual?
71,"Feb 7, 2022","Hopefully one of the many mangas, manhuas n mahwas I’ve read will come to be and I’ll finally be able to make use of this knowledge. Heaven for me would be being reborn in a world with dungeon breaks n leveling or the murim but with leveling or only ME! Hahahah one can only hope!!!"

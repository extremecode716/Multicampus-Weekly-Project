Episode,Date,Review
81,"Dec 1, 2021",Did he get a lot stronger because of the gibberish Dokja said to him that helped him reach higher enlightenment?😭🤣Please this is so funny.  
81,"Dec 1, 2021",Kim Dokja best wingman lmao 
81,"Dec 1, 2021",I was not expecting the fight that quickly. The pacing in this is the best. 
81,"Dec 1, 2021",What junghyuk was saying: don't embarrass me in front of my crush
81,"Dec 1, 2021","Parasite Queen: “H-how did you become so strong?!”Lycaon: “I have been enlightened!”
Dokja: -_-"
81,"Dec 1, 2021",Too bad Gilyeong isn't here. Having him meet the insect queen would have been interesting 🤔
81,"Dec 1, 2021","I love how every character is allowed to have their own selfish agenda to bring to the fight. Nobody is particularly a Saint, and makes decisions in gray rather than black or white, most of all our MC, Dokja. And I'm all here for it. "
81,"Dec 1, 2021",Junghyeouk owes Dokja big time
81,"Dec 1, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" says that the insect queen is far too ambitious and can't even withstand a simple acupuncture. ][The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" is thrilled with the participation of another guide.][5 coins have been sponsored. ]"
81,"Dec 1, 2021",Ain’t this the bug queen that Saitama slapped into oblivion? Lmao
81,"Dec 1, 2021",dokja being a total shipper
81,"Dec 1, 2021","Dokja used Attack Dog, it’s very effective "
81,"Dec 1, 2021",I love the private chat room giving us another voice that isn't utterly clueless
81,"Dec 1, 2021","I’m really exited to see how the *actual* poison beauty will act, especially around Junhyeok and Dokja since they’re the only ones who remember that the two used to date."
81,"Jan 1, 2022","Bruh Junghyeok really went ""bro don't embarrass me in front of my crush"". Doesn't look like he has anything to worry about tho, seeing that Dokja appears to be an expert wingman."
81,"Dec 1, 2021","""Is he expecting me to forgive me?"" I think I found a lil errrooorrrrr TwT"
81,"Dec 2, 2021",Lol. Dokja trying to avoid getting shipped with Junghyeok by getting the Seolhwa ship afloat.
81,"Jan 5, 2022",I wanna know how they’re sleeping 6 hours each day AND eating 3 meals per day while all this is going down
81,"Dec 1, 2021",Now I really want Dokja to learn the way of the wind but that’s unlikely 
81,"Dec 1, 2021",Dokja banking coins like a hedge fund in a recession. Wonder why he doesn't juice up to the gills and USADA bust those stats? Guess it'd turn into one punch man but when he unloads and beefs up it's pretty sick.
81,"Dec 1, 2021","oooooof this is getting better!! I understood what was happening during that fight, but omg it was portrayed better by the artist. very nice, & the artist that portrayed the wolf, ""kneel before the wind"" oooooof goosebumps, I really can't wait to see how the artist is gonna portrayed future chapters. even.. the next scenario.. boy that's gonna be a good one"
81,"Dec 3, 2021","I think it's funny how Lycaon says ""What on Earth are u doing?!"" to Antinus because it has a few possible implications. 1. He's learned Earth slang in his very short time of being on earth (plausible due to his master being Dokja tbh). 2. There's a similar saying back on Chronos and he just adapted it to fit the situation, which is pretty quick of him but also how'd he know it would translate well? 3. Dokja is translating everything so it's all his own interpretation??... continued in comments"
81,"Dec 1, 2021",Wow did not expect it to be so easy to get Antinus out of Seolhwa's body
81,"Dec 19, 2021",i’m planning to read the novel wish me luck guysss 😭😭
81,"Dec 1, 2021","After reading the novel, this is such a sight to see all these fights and situations play out. Looking forward to future updates :)"
81,"Jan 1, 2022",SEOLHWA IS SO HOT HELP-
81,"Dec 2, 2021",yo man if this manga does not get an anime I will feel beyond defended I will feel destroyed to my core like if it is not get one where's the Justice in the world there would be no justice and be other chaos this needs an anime that is not a need nor want is a pure legitimate fact thank you and good night 😘
81,"Dec 1, 2021",Lazy broke weeb I’m back wya imy🥺
81,"Dec 1, 2021","I love the writing but if I could be nitpicky I'd like to say ""what on earth"" confused me, as they're not originally from earth. I feel like ""what the hell"" would have been more fitting since it's more plausible that they'd have their own concept of hell on their world"
81,"Dec 1, 2021",ah yes another 5 coins put to proper use.
81,"Jan 5, 2022","and here I was worried what if seolhwa falls for dokja ...""Junghyeok sent me "" 🗿😂"
81,"Jan 5, 2022",I love how he healed her by poking...poke poke poke🤣🤣🤣
81,"Jan 5, 2022",Can’t wait to see Lee Seolhwa and Yu Junghyeok being besties✨ 
81,"Jan 5, 2022","anyone else think the fourth wall might be what's preventing him from learning the skill? He doesn't consider it real so he can't really pictured himself pulling it of, therefore he can't learn it? "
81,"Jan 5, 2022","Dammit Dokja, why can't you be an airbender too?"
81,"Jan 5, 2022",This turned into a Pokémon battle real quick
81,"Jan 5, 2022",all this shit happened in 3 days???
81,"Jan 5, 2022",I'm just wondering how any of them is still getting their 6 hours of sleep and have time for the 3 meals (I can't even manage that rn😭)
81,"Jan 5, 2022","BTW I don't know if anyone forgot, but the 'Pressure Point' skill was acquired from when Dokja was with Gilyoung and Sangah at the museum and where going up against those dolls that could be defeated by hitting the 'pressure points' on them."
81,"Jan 5, 2022","Antinus: You can't defeat me Dokja: Oh, I know, but he can *summons Imyuntar*"
81,"Jan 5, 2022","""he wants to forgive me for merely 300 coins ?"" LMAO 😂🗿"
81,"Jan 5, 2022","Typo""He wants me to forgive me for a measley 300 coins?"""
81,"Jan 5, 2022",lmao stingy doctor constellation
81,"Jan 5, 2022",Well now I get why Junghyeok was mad when Dokja couldn't learn The Way of the Wind...... I feel like this isn't even the best well-rounded skill yet
81,"Jan 5, 2022","little does she know, wolf dude has reached enlightenment since they last met"
81,"Jan 5, 2022",coat soon...
81,"Dec 30, 2021",who else wants this to be an anime 😭
81,"Jan 5, 2022",Where's One Slap Man? 👋💥🐝
81,"Jan 5, 2022",I high key wanna boop Lycan nose 
81,"Jan 5, 2022","I wonder if Gilyeong would have been able to reason with her and make her change her mind by talking. She is a bug after all, and he has some control over them, even if they were never humanoid before."
81,"Jan 7, 2022","It is significantly more engaging to see protagonists being smart (utilizing resources, acting on knowledge, and relying on allies) than for them to be able to gain all the skills and solve all the problems single-handedly. "
81,"Jan 5, 2022","Anybody got...like, a REALLY big bug zapper?"
81,"Jan 7, 2022",48 days until C o a t
81,"Jan 5, 2022","DUUUDE IT'S SO FUCKING COOL TO SEE ALL THESE SCENES DRAWN OUT AFTER READIN THE NOVEL, THE ART IS AMAZING"
81,"Jan 5, 2022","Do you think the reason Dokja can't use the winds is because he doesn't understand it fully. He knows about it from the book, and that prior knowledge is preventing him from discovering what it means to him and subsequently can't properly understand."
81,"Jan 5, 2022","It's really good fir all these different characters to have different agendas which don't always rely on ""There's only one place for the strongest person"" "
81,"Jan 5, 2022",The panel with Dojka hand having dirt on it is well drawn
81,"Dec 2, 2021",When you fast passing 65 days ahead you know it’s good shiiit 
81,"Dec 1, 2021",And we still on day one 😂🤣😂😂 longest day eva!!! 
81,"Jan 10, 2022",god i love lee seolhwa so much i want her to perform open heart surgery on me
81,"Jan 6, 2022",Im amazed at how you can draw and color so much detail in only a week! WOAH
81,"Jan 6, 2022",I think Naruto should take notes on how quickly you can get fight scenes done with
81,"Jan 5, 2022",DOKJA! JUST AIRBEND! JUST! DO IT! YOU CANT? TRY HARDER!!
81,"Jan 5, 2022","I'm on a fence here. on one side I can understand wanting to rebuild your home, but using the earth as groundwork? I don't like it"
81,"Jan 13, 2022","Dokja isn't just a casual web reader, he's a bookworm knowledgeable of both local and overseas folk lores, epics, legends, and myths. Why did he even become a corporate slave when he's this knowledgeable on literature and history?"
81,"Jan 9, 2022",Dokja can piss anybody off lol
81,"Jan 9, 2022",Nooooooo I was behind. Which let me binge. Now I have to wait again 🥲
81,"Jan 7, 2022",This whole 80 chapters felt so short T-T
81,"Jan 6, 2022",Wow Dokja already using Lyacon to his advantage in this fight! So dope👍🔥
81,"Jan 6, 2022",man those are some really long days
81,"Jan 6, 2022",it would be nice if he could use that bookmark skill...
81,"Jan 5, 2022",Would be cool to see Dokja manage to collect all 25 chapters of the Donguibogam as time goes on.
81,"Jan 5, 2022","Guess what insect queen, you fly in the 'air', which is 'wind'... who do you thinknis going to win?"
81,"Jan 5, 2022","I love that 😂 *so intense* ..........""poke poke poke"""
81,"Jan 5, 2022",soon we see best kid girl
81,"Jan 5, 2022","1. why does she look like the mosquito monster from One Punch Man and 2. I fockin love wolves and this boi, I will willingly suffocate in his fluff cause is so cute and handsome!"
81,"Jan 5, 2022",why is everyone one my ig explore page so sad over the orv novel🤔🤔
81,"Dec 29, 2021",The way I did not even expect that all he needed to do was a freaking acupuncture 😂 [+5 coins for unpredictability] 
81,"Jan 12, 2022",I honestly am sooo curious abt dokja's character profile ...
81,"Jan 9, 2022",....So the guides are totally later bosses to fight then? They're just helping for a scenario or three max? 
81,"Jan 7, 2022","I remember reading a version of it, but 2 see Seolhwa get freed from the mind control like that, and have Dokja say it was Junhyeok who asked him to dit hits so much more in full visual. Really wholesome scene, because Junghyeok as Tsundere/prickly has to admit that Dokja really is a decent person despite his shenanigans. The easier route would be to do as he asked and just kill her, but he’s willing to do the harder route for the better outcome holistically +Junghyeok gets a 2nd chance with her"
81,"Jan 7, 2022","Dokja isn't gonna give up on his OTP no way, not after 3000+ chapters !!!! (┛◉Д◉)┛彡┻━┻"
81,"Jan 6, 2022",I think eventually Dokja is going to make everyone one of the Ten Evils his allies 
81,"Jan 6, 2022","Dokja: ""If you don't behave, I'm gonna tell!"""
81,"Jan 6, 2022",Dokja says random gibberish:Lycaon: Enlightenment achieved! Secret achievement unlocked!
81,"Jan 6, 2022","Also ""KYAH KYAH KYAH KYAH KYAH"" ah I understand."
81,"Jan 5, 2022",I should have not read it all so quickly now I can't bear the cliffhanger 😩😩😩
81,"Jan 5, 2022","As I have read the novel, kdj, have you forgot your op skill called idk.... 'bookmark'?"
81,"Jan 5, 2022",they toned down a scene in this chapter and all the thought behind it and idk how to feel about it
81,"Jan 5, 2022",i didn't know dokja's gibrish talk would be this damn strong w(°ｏ°)w
81,"Jan 5, 2022",the 'What on Earth are you doing?' We can ask the same of you
81,"Jan 5, 2022",That's a cool story but where is the child ??? He can control insects and be friend with them ... How is he not here ?
81,"Jan 5, 2022","it's funny to me that eventho lycan is not from earth he still says ""what on earth are you doing"""
81,"Jan 5, 2022",the WebToon is as good with the Cliffhangers then the webnovel.
81,"Jan 5, 2022",the time is going so slow i dont even know what game to compare it to.

81,"Jan 5, 2022","""He wants me to forgive me for merely 300 coins"" people these days, so stingy"
81,"Jan 5, 2022",Dokja used plot armor lvl 9001.
81,"Jan 5, 2022",Anyone else wondering where the frick Gilyeong is? 
81,"Mar 5, 2022","insect queen: how u got dis strong?cute wolf: a powerful sage master led me to enlightenment 🙏
Dokja: 👀"
81,"Jan 23, 2022",lycaon got enlightened by dokja’s gibberish lmao… also imagine if gilyeong was here to see the insect :o
81,"Jan 10, 2022",antinus looked like someone destined to be slapped by saitama ngl
81,"Jan 9, 2022",man im all caught up to the free content... man this was one heck of a ride. cant wait for more free episodes to come out (or paid on PC).

81,"Jan 6, 2022","""you should kneel to the wind!"" dude..... no. she.....dead ...."
81,"Jan 5, 2022",Dokja just isn’t the Avatar.  Can’t learn the catastrophe abilities
81,"Jan 5, 2022","I rly hope, that Dokya will be able to use the ""wind"" skill. Maybe with a special item he doesn't know of, because in the novel he read, ""junghyuk yu"" didn't have to find or use it. "
81,"Jan 5, 2022",why does a insect have hair? idk why but i hate it.

81,"Jan 7, 2022",there have been a lot of typos and grammatical errors in these past few episodes... has no one been proofreading?

81,"Jan 6, 2022",I can't wait for the next episode!
81,"Jan 6, 2022",Are these stories based on real Korean history or Korean folklores? Cause a lot of this seems a bit all over the place if this was all original content by the author. It's as if you should already know these stories.
81,"Jan 5, 2022",That small wound tho...will likely be troubling. Can she transfer a bit of herself quickly? Can Dokja self-acupuncture?
81,"Jan 5, 2022",Good boi lycaon
81,"Jan 5, 2022",Man i love lycaon
81,"Jan 5, 2022",Lmao Dokja is playing the cupid hahaha

81,"Jan 5, 2022","Am I the only one who, when saw the true form of the insect queen at first or whatever her name is, thought that she looked like that mosquito monster lady from One Punch Man in the episode when Saitama meets Genos?"
81,"Jan 5, 2022","[The Constellation, Demon King of Intrigue, is amused by the wind wolf man.]"
81,"Jan 5, 2022",Welp there go her wings— also I’m interested to see what Seolwha is like when she’s not being possessed by a vengeful parasitic bug-demon thing XD okay but the translation errors in this ep though 💀
81,"Jan 5, 2022","That a bit easier than I thought, yet the fact that they want to rebuild Chronos ain't gonna be good at all later on"

Episode,Date,Review
74,"Oct 13, 2021",I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs the author? Or someone he‚Äôs related to. That‚Äôs the only way they would know for sure he‚Äôs Dokja right? Either way I can‚Äôt wait to see where it leads
74,"Oct 13, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" bids goodluck with the choice of constellation of the incarnation ""HSY"".] [The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" sees flashbacks of the 4th scenario upon seeing the meteorite.] [5 coins have been sponsored. ]"
74,"Oct 13, 2021","Dokja's current ""I'm Junghyeok"" counter: 2"
74,"Oct 13, 2021","So, quick question, anyone else ever think that the ‚ÄòSecretive Plotter‚Äô constellation could be the author? (spoils in comments, be warned)"
74,"Oct 13, 2021",abyssal black flame dragon: constellation of chuunis üò≠
74,"Oct 13, 2021",Can't we talk about how badass they drew the women in this chapter pls. Youngran character profile looks so good
74,"Oct 13, 2021",It‚Äôs his mom I feel it guys
74,"Oct 23, 2021","Can we all just a appropriate the research the author of Omniscient reader had to do make the constellations actual cultural and historical figures. The author did the prep work and it was successful, and I respect that mindset"
74,"Oct 13, 2021",That panel previewing the constellations was seriously beautiful! I can't wait to see more of them 
74,"Oct 13, 2021","Kdj just got ride of one trauma and now another one pops up, just let the man be happy already "
74,"Oct 13, 2021",Holy wow it‚Äôs so fun to read the comments having finished the book. I love the theories y‚Äôall are coming up with!! It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm experiencing it anew. üòÅ
74,"Oct 13, 2021","Exciting to finally see Demonic Judge of Fire, Great Sage Heavens Equal, and Secretive Plotter? Even if it‚Äôs only their silhouettes! I‚Äôve been dying to see how they portray the first one! (I don‚Äôt wanna reveal their names in case people didn‚Äôt figure it out from the modifiers)"
74,"Nov 17, 2021",Dokja really tried to pull that 'I'm Yoo Jonghyuk' shit again lol.
74,"Oct 13, 2021","I think the author would be a much bigger character, someone like the constellations, so I'm betting it's Dokja's mother or some other relative, who read TWSA on Dokja's account, so it didn't show in the novel's statistics "
74,"Nov 17, 2021","Whenever y‚Äôall think you‚Äôre cringe, stop and remember all the times Kim Dokja confidently says he‚Äôs Yoo Jonghyuk."
74,"Oct 14, 2021","As someone who red the whole novel, I'm absolutely fan of the way Suyeong and the king of wanderers are introduced in. The story is now starting and I hope we will have the whole novel in Webtoon !"
74,"Oct 13, 2021","I have never second guessed myself to spend coins for ORV manhwa everytime new chapter is out. This is already part of my monthly commitment. Alas, what the hell is up with Suyeong's dialogue at early page? Her first regression? She didn't even have regression stigma. That's a strange way to describe 1st sponsor selection. "
74,"Oct 13, 2021",Did she just say her first regression?
74,"Oct 13, 2021",I‚Äôve read the novel‚Ä¶ I was so confused at this point. But it turned into one of the most important plot points in Dokja‚Äôs story.
74,"Oct 20, 2021","At this point, I don't know who does it better - Dokja or Webtoon - in getting coins out of their viewers or readers "
74,"Nov 17, 2021","Do you know greek history? Do you know perhaps Odysseus? The most mischievous, strong and clever man in Greek history. Dokja reminds me of him. Odysseus allways hide his identity when encountering an unknown group of people or a person, and Dokja's doing the same thing. Odysseus was ready to put himself in danger for his people, Dokja's doing the same. Odysseus knew when to attack and when to kill, he never killed out of joy or without a reason, and Dokja's the same."
74,"Oct 13, 2021",WE GOT SP CRUMBS
74,"Oct 13, 2021",yo there's no way that's not his mom because of the way he talked about her and the fact she already knew him + not having a profile
74,"Oct 14, 2021",It‚Äôs fun watching people trying to predict what will happen even though I already know most of the answers :p
74,"Oct 13, 2021","So first we got the big onee-san (Huiwon), then the popular girl (Min), the tsundere (Suyeong) and now the milf (Dokja's Mom, assuming it's her). "
74,"Nov 14, 2021",OMAYGHAAADDD!! Uriel's silhouette in this chapter!! (Ôº¥‚ñΩÔº¥)üíõ URIEL STANS UNITE!
74,"Oct 13, 2021","so glad this is a welcoming and I can continue supporting the author. I recommend you read the web novel to which is finished, it's just KEEPS GETTING BETTER!! "
74,"Oct 13, 2021","Reading it, I got the feeling that she was his mom. I can't explain why. Now that I'm in the comments section, it seems to be a common sentiment."
74,"Nov 17, 2021","Started reading the novel, and normally I find webtoon adaptations to miss out on a lot of important parts, but here instead I find the art does such a fantastic job at capturing and portraying the characters and world (the expressions in particular are top notch) and at the pacing, that I'm getting an even better experience here. Author and artist, you guys rock so much."
74,"Nov 17, 2021","""my first regression"" is mistranslated. The chance to get sponsor in one regression is not only once, so I think ""first round"" could be more accurate. ""Regression"" is too specific."
74,"Nov 17, 2021","Dokja, stop indirectly insulting the big black lizard, don't you see that you're making it sad~"
74,"Nov 17, 2021","I read that character profile as ""runway model,"" then ""runaway model,"" and FINALLY ""runaway model prisoner."""
74,"Nov 17, 2021","Most comments are wondering who is king of the wanderers, and I'm here can't stop giggling over Han Sooyoung delusion 'that's as absurd as when people called me plagiarist' XD her audacity wow"
74,"Nov 18, 2021","So we got an all-group women in what looks like prison uniforms, mention of a penitentiary, and a prison break skill. We saw a flashback of Dokja's mother crouching over someone that is apparently Dokja's worst trauma/nightmare. My guess is that king is his mother, and she killed his father and was sent to prison for it. That's why she knows it's Dokja and trusts him, and because she was already kinda psycho she's been able to survive this well."
74,"Nov 17, 2021","For a scenario in which the first instruction is to eat 3 times a day and sleep 8 hours, we sure don't see them seeking food or shelter a lot"
74,"Nov 17, 2021","Lol They post up all boss and then say 'Hey we got this street, you can take care of the rest of the city' .... Gee, ThanksüòÖ"
74,"Nov 17, 2021",kim dokja on yu junghyeok's name: ITS FREE REAL ESTATE. this duo is so funny. i love their dynamics
74,"Oct 14, 2021","yknow, I think imma reread the entire series again. that way I'll have at least one episode to read when I get back to this episode"
74,"Nov 17, 2021","Off topic from the main part of this chapter, but gotta love it when the plagiarist says ""That's as absurd as when people called me out as a plagiarist"" üòÖ"
74,"Nov 17, 2021","I am sorry, what? She wants the Abyssal dragon as her constellation? The dragon Who wants destruktion and will eventually turn their incarnation insane murderhobos? Does she not know that? And Dokja was even given a spinsorship from him and a very higly ranked constellation(I refuse to believe that Sun Wukong is not highly ranked) "
74,"Nov 17, 2021","If the king is his mom, then maybe she isn't the author, but the person responsible for turning TWSA into reality. As in she put a VR headset on Dokja so he lives his story in real life. She knows he reads the book and enjoys it, so she wanted to give him the gift of living it. When he finishes the story or game, he takes off his headset or unplugs and realizes what his mom did for him."
74,"Nov 17, 2021",If it is his mom his moms a milf
74,"Oct 15, 2021","""you just can't stop lying, can you?"" well u will get used to it hsyü§£"
74,"Oct 13, 2021",Who? Author? Mom?
74,"Nov 18, 2021",mommy? sorry. mommy? sorry. mommy? sorry.mommy? sorry? 
74,"Nov 18, 2021",Nobody gonna talk about Suyeong plagiarizing everything‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúElemental bullets.‚Äù ‚ÄúBullets infused with holy properties.‚Äù Like damn it‚Äôs her whole nature to say the off brand version
74,"Nov 17, 2021","The tension just keeps rising, I might really have to go read the web novel. I cant keep waiting lol"
74,"Nov 19, 2021",OMG they are so cool??
74,"Nov 19, 2021",HIS MOM?!
74,"Nov 19, 2021",I bet its his mum
74,"Nov 18, 2021",Mom kinda hot tho 
74,"Nov 17, 2021",I think the craziest thing is the king could tell Dokja was checking him.
74,"Nov 17, 2021",Fellow readers of the light novel please don't spoil it for others.
74,"Nov 17, 2021",Clearly she‚Äôs the real author and that‚Äôs why she has fourth wall as well
74,"Oct 13, 2021",i feel like this character is gonna be either his mother or the author
74,"Nov 27, 2021",Is that a traumatising-mother vibe I feel ?
74,"Nov 22, 2021",I read this from start to finish in one day and now I am being punished for itüòî
74,"Nov 19, 2021",HOLY SHIT IS THAT HIS MOM?!
74,"Nov 17, 2021","Thank you Author for this webtoon, I was having quite a shitty time after losing a friendship and you just made my day with Dokja lying that he's Junghyoek üòÇ"
74,"Nov 17, 2021","To anyone who has read the whole thing, I‚Äôve almost read the entire book and I don‚Äôt know if I can keep living I‚Äôm so heartbroken. When she said stuff about plagiarism it now just breaks my heart thinking about what it really was ahhhhhh"
74,"Nov 23, 2021",Just imagine if Dokja‚Äôs mom was the author of ‚ÄúTWSA‚Äù. That would be absolutely crazy 
74,"Nov 20, 2021",I've made this comment already but when Sooyoung says 'first regression that is a MISTRANSLATION. It should be 'first round' of sponsor selection since there's more than one round of selecting a sponsor. These are the kind of webtoon translations that I have problems with because they cause confusion.
74,"Nov 20, 2021","excuse me, are we gonna gloss over ""on my first regression""????"
74,"Nov 19, 2021",OH MY I HOPE ITS HIS MOM KYAAA
74,"Nov 18, 2021",salute for the artwork!
74,"Nov 18, 2021","Damn!! It's his mom! That flashback wouldn't have appeared otherwise. And it seems like she was once imprisoned, since her allies are all prisoners. I thought Dokja's trauma involved something happening to his mom, but maybe the mom killed the father infront of Dokja? "
74,"Nov 18, 2021",He overcame his trauma but he'll also eventually overcome his tragedy
74,"Nov 18, 2021",omohh is that his mom?.?? 
74,"Nov 17, 2021",I think that‚Äôs the mom. Also the mom killed someone right? Was it his dad? ü§î
74,"Nov 17, 2021",holy bleeping hellhounds batman  if there are that many gods and demon kings and constellations can one of them drop me like just the tiniest fraction  of power I would really appreciate  it 
74,"Nov 17, 2021","dokja calling himself junghyuk hits different when you have finished the novel ü•≤. also, 51 49"
74,"Nov 17, 2021","oh no, it's finally time for me to join Lazy Broke Weeb in sponsoring 5 coins for Fast Pass ü§£"
74,"Nov 17, 2021","I've never screamed so loud my entire life. I NEED NEXT WEDNESDAY ALREADY... and maybe, week after that's wednesday too."
74,"Nov 17, 2021",Definitely his serial killer mama.
74,"Nov 17, 2021","calling it now, that person is his mom, who I think may also be the author."
74,"Nov 17, 2021",the constellation [One Who Reads Too Much] has finally joined the [Poor People] who haven't got any money. +5 coins.
74,"Nov 17, 2021",is the forth wall shaking?!?!IS THE FORTH WALL SHAKING?!?!?!?!?!
74,"Nov 17, 2021","Trench Coat? Well, they gotta be powerful then."
74,"Nov 17, 2021","well i mean the author of TWSA is still out there somewhere, that fits everything we've seen here with the king of the wanderers,  it would mack sence"
74,"Oct 13, 2021",Your true face... What kind of... face is it? I wonder... The face under the mask... Is that... your true face?
74,"Dec 1, 2021",I believe it is his mother and she knows alot because he told her alot (since he didn't Like talking about other stuff) and I think His mother was a criminal
74,"Nov 28, 2021","If I had a nickel for every time Dokja said he was Junghyeok Yu, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's strange that it happened twice."
74,"Nov 27, 2021",Maybe her mother or cousin or aunt?
74,"Nov 26, 2021",The plagiarizer is so cute cause of the way she reacts to things and thinks. Edgelord constellation lmfao
74,"Nov 24, 2021",Can you imagine failing this scenerio just because you couldn't get 6 hours of sleep? HAHA
74,"Nov 23, 2021",I binged read this for the past 2days and then it just... ends? üòÄ this is why I hate reading on-going works... I don't have patience ;-;
74,"Nov 22, 2021",she‚Äôs such a boss i can‚Äôt wait for her face reveal
74,"Nov 22, 2021",Wow there‚Äôs a lot of spam in the comments on this chapter. Let‚Äôs all please keep reporting the comments so that hopefully webtoon will do something about it. And friendly reminder to never click links that aren‚Äôt from a trusted source!
74,"Nov 22, 2021","I think his mom killed his dad. just a theory. I mean, it would make sense why dokja was there if she did. She killed his father at their home, dokja came home from school to find his mom standing over the body, his mom tells him not to tell anyone and she gets sent away once shes found out. Though the reason for the killing is unknown to me. I'm not a fast passer btw. this is just a prediction."
74,"Nov 20, 2021","nooooo I dont have any coins right nowww... I'm seriously hooked on this story.. I've been reading it almost nonstop since I started... first thing im gonna do when I get some coinage is spend here, it's well deserved."
74,"Nov 20, 2021",One thing I find interesting about this manhwa is that there is no love interest.
74,"Nov 20, 2021",Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. 
74,"Nov 19, 2021",I think that lady is his mother. The way he reacts and how the king knew him already.
74,"Nov 19, 2021",WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
74,"Nov 19, 2021",At least dokja and suyeong have sth in common..I love them üòÜ..üòÜ
74,"Nov 19, 2021","Two types of trauma in the past 3 episodes, poor boy"
74,"Nov 19, 2021","Not me screaming. Nope, no screams at all. The mask is way cooler than I imagined."
74,"Nov 19, 2021",omg his mother LOOKS SO MUCH MORE BADASS THAN I IMAGINED
74,"Nov 19, 2021",w h a t bruh speedrun this series in 2 days üò¶üòßüò®üò∞üò•üò¢üò≠

74,"Oct 13, 2021","Here, take it, we don't want it"
74,"Nov 19, 2021","I have a theory, if Dokja‚Äôs ability ‚ÄúCharacter Profile‚Äùdoesn‚Äôt work, then would it not make sense the lady with the mask is the author herself? Think about it, if Dokja‚Äôs ability cannot be used to access her character profile, it would make sense that the author has an OP ability to counter his. The only loophole i can possibly think of is that his ability isn‚Äôt high enough level, constellation interference, she has a stigma that makes her immune to his ability, or perhaps a new concept?"
74,"Nov 18, 2021",WAS THAT A SAIKI REFERENCE????
74,"Nov 18, 2021",THAT MIGHT BE THE AUTHOR!!! He's the one who read her novel till the end and even got a copy of it through email. She already knows he's Dokja Kim.. most likely because she saw him in his profile or through his account
74,"Oct 3, 2022","I've read this series too many times for my mental health, and I've just realized how his character profile works. He doesn't get a profile for his mom or for Sangah not because he doesn't have the information, but because he doesn't see them as characters, similarly to The Fourth Wall."
74,"Jul 8, 2022",is that his mother??!!
74,"Jul 4, 2022",I think it's his mom because the scenes that were showing at the final of the chapter are similar to the ones on that chapter where he met Anna Croft
74,"Mar 9, 2022",oh hi momüëãüèæ thanks for the meterorite
74,"Jan 26, 2022",I dunno why I thought they were Americans when I saw the guns on themüòÇ
74,"Dec 27, 2021",Bet she's his mother
74,"Dec 17, 2021",who else thought it was his mother at first üôãüôã
74,"Dec 2, 2021",It‚Äôs the mom‚Ä¶. I think- It has to be!!
74,"Dec 1, 2021",WAIT! Is she his mother???? üò±
74,"Nov 24, 2021","the women with black hair looks similar to Dokja, the other women is she somehow related to yu? the last panel made my heart stops for a second that's how beautiful the art is."
74,"Nov 23, 2021",All of these theories are terrific
74,"Nov 22, 2021",iSN'T ABYSSAL WAS IN ONE OF THE CHOICES IN DOKJAs' ATTRIBUTE TOO?
74,"Nov 22, 2021",It‚Äôs probably his mom cause of the flashback & kinda would make sense why the other lady had a prison escape skill (they could of been prisoners) and why she knew exactly who he was 
74,"Nov 20, 2021",I just love the dynamic between these two
74,"Nov 20, 2021","Myeongoh Han‚Ä¶oh gods, you‚Äôll be in for surprise when you see him again‚Ä¶üòÖMAN, KING IS HERE! YES GUYS REMEMBER THE FLASHBACKS? And now we have this new character‚Äî they‚Äôre both clues that are very important for KDJ‚Äôs backstory!"
74,"Nov 19, 2021",I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs his mother? Based on the trauma? Maybe not tho
74,"Nov 19, 2021",if this webtoon was an anime .. it wouldve been so famous ..   
74,"Nov 19, 2021",IS IT HIS MOM OMFFGHSHDBXNS
74,"Nov 19, 2021",THAT'S HIS MOM
74,"Nov 19, 2021",OoO hello momma
74,"Nov 18, 2021",Everybody talking about the king while i‚Äôm here still laughing at Kaido  (from saiki k) appeared in the bg lol
74,"Nov 18, 2021","I'm guessing she is either the mom, anna croft, the author or all of them if you know what I mean."
74,"Nov 18, 2021",When you know the plot for reading the whole novel but you can't say anything because spoilers.
74,"Nov 18, 2021",they kinda look like the prophet
74,"Nov 18, 2021",King mom? King writer? hmmm ü§îü§î
74,"Nov 18, 2021",the king is the author ( that is my Theory)

74,"Nov 17, 2021",IS IT THE LADY HE SAW IN THAT WHITE SPACE????
74,"Nov 17, 2021",Is that his mother? She would know about part of the story by being around Dokja as he read it.
74,"Nov 17, 2021",its so entertaining seeing webtoon onlys trying to guessbal the unpredictable plot points orv has hehe

74,"Nov 17, 2021",Just don't assume anything about the author guys. Try not to assume about most things on this webtoon 
74,"Nov 17, 2021",so the comments said that maybe the girl is his mom I think so too maybe? because the girl who spoke said that he's Dokja like she's super sure maybe the leader told them about that
74,"Nov 17, 2021",Is that the prophet from the first few episodes?
74,"Nov 17, 2021",Dang that‚Äôs probably a mystery that won‚Äôt be revealed for a while now‚Ä¶ very interesting tho. 
74,"Nov 17, 2021",I‚Äôd die trying to complete the conditions of survival because I don‚Äôt know sleep. Only webtoon
74,"Nov 17, 2021",I'm with the people that think she's his mom. She was in the flashback he had when he died and became a ghost and it is a horrible and traumatic memory for Dokja. Probably his mom killed his dad and went to prison for it and that is probably Dokja's last memory of her? It would also fit to what the profile off her subordinate showed about the prison escape skill since the whole group consists of female prisoners.
74,"Nov 17, 2021",she‚Äôs hot
74,"Nov 17, 2021","I am not the only one thinking the king is Anna Croft, right? "
74,"Nov 17, 2021",why do I get the feeling dokja is actually going to become junghyeok and he just stole that guy's name to make people fear him but over time he'll actually just become him???? that's why dokja is the protag and not junghyeok
74,"Nov 17, 2021",Who else remembers Myeongoh Han XD
74,"Nov 17, 2021","Hello, as a welcome gift I give you a meteor and 4 catastrophes"
74,"Nov 17, 2021","So I know it's ""runaway model prisoner"" but with the original line break I read that as ""runaway model"" and wasn't sure if it was a typo and should be ""runway model"" instead"
74,"Nov 17, 2021","So when sooyoung mentioned this being her first regression, does that mean she is also a regress or like jungyeok yu?"
74,"Nov 17, 2021","Is- is that his mom? (So since she knows a lot, some people are wondering if she‚Äôs the author, so I propose that she is both his mom AND the author)"
74,"Nov 17, 2021",does his mother need a servant? 
74,"Nov 17, 2021",Maybe she‚Äôs read a webtoon of him? Like how he is with Junhyeok.
74,"Nov 14, 2021",dang that example demon king is kind of sexie ... hope we get to meet one soon :^]
74,"Nov 13, 2021",This might be my first time ever using coins and its SO WORTH üò≠
74,"Nov 10, 2021",Suyeong is way too funny üíÄ... at least they have some similar mindset ..
74,"Oct 15, 2021","I totally love how Sleepy C potray the constellations in every chapter. Majestic yet mysterious, can't wait till the fifth scenario arc.The thrill and fun is about to begin üòÜ"
74,"Oct 14, 2021","""my name is junghyeok yu"" ü¶ëü§°ü§°ü§°"
74,"Oct 14, 2021","I'm seeing people theorizing about this king either being Dokja's mom, or the author, but who says they aren't one and the same? We, the readers of this story, still don't know who the author is, so why would Dokja, or anyone in that universe know who the author really was/is?"
74,"Oct 13, 2021",can I get a job description for being a runaway model?
74,"Oct 13, 2021",f*ckin... Sangah? is that you? messin around?
74,"Nov 18, 2021","People are saying that it‚Äôs the author or mis mom, an here am I, thinking it was Anna Croft. ü•≤"
74,"Nov 18, 2021",Now hear me out it might be crazy but what if Dokja's mom write TWSA for him to deal with the trauma she probably put him through.
74,"Nov 18, 2021",It's dokjas mum. 
74,"Nov 17, 2021","For a second I thought that the black haired lady was his mom (bc they looked similar), realized she wasn't, but now... I'm so excited for this scenario. And how many more times will Dokja pretend to be Yu Junghyeok lol "
74,5 days ago,"Wait, isn't that her mom, from the flashback?"
74,5 days ago,"I'm positive that's his mom! I recall something he thought in the subway on one of the first episodes that leads me to believe that king is his mom! I cannot recall what it is, though."
74,5 days ago,"That's his mother, I think."
74,5 days ago,his mom?
74,5 days ago,"all of this is kdh imagination probs, Secretive plotter and one more constellation who i forget are kdh and yjh respectively sry for the spoilers but that woman is his mother"
74,6 days ago,I feel like it's his mother. The bully said Dokja's mother made the frontpage of newspapers back when he was in high school so I'm guessing that she was sentenced to life time in jail for murder  
74,"Oct 6, 2022",it definitely his mother 
74,"Oct 6, 2022",why do I have feeling it's the mom?!?! it's gotta be right??? for him to be shaking like that with just one glance!!!
74,"Oct 2, 2022",I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs his mom

74,"Sep 17, 2022",it's his mom
74,"Sep 16, 2022",She's probably his mom.
74,"Sep 8, 2022",Prisoners‚Ä¶ and his mom committed a murder. The masked woman has the same hair color‚Ä¶ HUH?!
74,"Sep 7, 2022",i feel like thats his mom

74,"Sep 1, 2022",Is it the mother
74,"Aug 31, 2022",is it mom?
74,"Aug 31, 2022",...Spoilers in replies v
74,"Aug 28, 2022","I'm guessing his mom bcz the bully also mentions how Dokja's mom makes headlines, so she must have killed someone which traumatized him as well. Not to mention that all the women there look like they came out of prison"
74,"Aug 28, 2022","I believe the woman could be his mom. plus, since he's her son, she probably saw him reading the web novel before or something. "
74,"Aug 21, 2022",Is that his mom
74,"Aug 13, 2022",Yo that‚Äôs his mom

74,"Aug 10, 2022","Ah, is that his mother? I remember she also had brown hair. That would explain the traumatic face."
74,"Aug 10, 2022",its either 1. the author of twsa or 2. his mom
74,"Aug 7, 2022",HAHA it's the mom for me. 
74,"Aug 7, 2022",Motha is that you?
74,"Aug 7, 2022","Mommy? Is that you?I mean, Dokja could have talked about it, so she didn't read it herself while knowing about it. 
And the flashbacks seem to point to her killing, so she would probably have been in jail when it started. 

In whether this is right or wrong, don't tell me if you know. "
74,"Aug 4, 2022","No way?... She have the same ability as yours?so you can't read her profile and he know that you read her too? I guess that she must have useful ability, and maybe that because her mask? "
74,"Aug 4, 2022",thats the novel editor i guess.
74,"Jul 31, 2022",its his MOM I think. mom went to jail for killing dad or smthn.it went all over the news. and since domja had no friends he only told his mom Abt TWSA so she remembers parts of it
74,"Jul 29, 2022",just to imagine they (Hyuseon and Suyeon) are both HANs. and are both been watched by a Dark Lord ü§£ü§£ü§£
74,"Jul 28, 2022",I thought that was his mom or something. Gotta stop making these characters look alike lol. Maybe his mom is in the mask 
74,"Jul 17, 2022",if you know then you know üëÄ
74,"Jul 15, 2022",Wait!! is that woman dokja's mom

74,"Jun 19, 2022",it's probably his mom
74,"Jun 14, 2022",omg it's his mom!?!?!? what the heckkkkkkk I did NOT expect that

74,"Jun 10, 2022",mommy? is that you?
74,"Jun 10, 2022",That looks like his mother 
74,"Jun 9, 2022",Very caring mom i see
74,"Jun 6, 2022","I think she is Dokja's mom or that women in the flashbacks who murdered someone ! ( Suhyong also said that ""she is just like you"" )"
74,"Jun 4, 2022",holy shit guys when they bullied him they said don't make the front pages like your mom..... that's his fucking mom she read his favorite novel to feel closer to her son. I love this webtoon. always hideing shit in the background
74,"Jun 2, 2022",ITS HIS MOTHER..WHO KILLED HIS DAD AND WAS IN JAIL THATS HOW SHE KNEW THOSE PRISONERS
74,"May 31, 2022","YO IS THAT HIS MOM?!?! EVEN WHEN I SAW CHO YEONGRAN I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS HIS MOM, BUT NOW I THINK THE KING IS HIS MOM AND SONG MINU EVEN SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HIS MOM BEING FAMOUS OR SOMETHING AND 'CAUSE OF THAT I DON'T THINK DOKJA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS MOM WAS VERY GOOD THUS THE THUMP THUMPING AT THE END "
74,"May 31, 2022",King of wanderer is Dokja's mother. 
74,"May 21, 2022",Holy shit! I think that‚Äôs his mom?! She has the same hair color too!
74,"May 20, 2022",probably the author or his mom or both (the mom wrote the novel) üëÄ
74,"May 15, 2022",I think that's his mom as soon as he saw her he has the same flashback he had when thinking abt his mom
74,"May 13, 2022",it's his mom
74,"May 5, 2022","hmmmmmm I got the ""mom"" vibe there for a bit, from his previous flashbacks "
74,"May 5, 2022",is that his mum
74,"May 5, 2022",Mommy dearest came back to haunt you 
74,"May 5, 2022",Soo it‚Äôs his mother wow
74,"Apr 30, 2022","That person is a he or she? The figure is extremely gorgeous! üòç
And this group looks like they're prisoners or a group of (women) from rehabilitation center..."
74,"Apr 27, 2022","Judging by the flashback, and the long hair, and the sheer shock he expressed. Calling it now, it's his mom."
74,"Apr 27, 2022",mommy?
74,"Apr 22, 2022","what if, it's his mom. And his mom is the author? "
74,"Apr 21, 2022",I think it's Dokja's mom that has been shown already to cause him trauma.  She is also referenced by rumors of something she did which is hinted at in the flashback. maybe killing someone close like their dad. idk.
74,"Apr 21, 2022","Wait, is she his mom?? The bully said that she was arrested, right?"
74,"Apr 21, 2022",hey is that shun from saiki? 
74,"Apr 20, 2022",Nice Saiki.K Reference.
74,"Apr 20, 2022",I'm guessing that the Wanderer King was his Mother.
74,"Apr 20, 2022",MOTHER?!?!
74,"Apr 17, 2022",‚Ä¶ no way‚Ä¶ right? talk about mommy issues‚Ä¶
74,"Apr 16, 2022",Was that his mom?

74,"Apr 15, 2022","omg watch it be his mom, I'm sure of it"
74,"Apr 15, 2022",His mom? disnt his mom give him trauma so thats what im guessing
74,"Apr 14, 2022","Hello, mother."
74,"Apr 14, 2022",The real author!?! 
74,"Apr 13, 2022","So, that king of the wanderer is dokja's mom? I can definitely be wrong but. This flashback was when dokja saw his mom in front of the dad's body, wasn't it? "
74,"Apr 13, 2022","Every time Dokja lies about his identity, a song pops up in my head about lies. üéµThat's a lie, that's a lie, that's a lie, lie, lie! üé∂ü§£"
74,"Apr 13, 2022",it resembles her mom üò© lol

74,"Apr 7, 2022",is it his mom?üëÄüëÄüëÄ
74,"Apr 7, 2022",maybe his mom?
74,"Apr 6, 2022",mum???
74,"Apr 2, 2022","Did Dokjas mom kill his dad? We saw a peek of Dokjas trauma when he came across the specters, which was a woman standing over a man's dead body, presumably his mom and dad. Then Dokjas bully makes a comment about his mom being in the news, also the group is from a prison. (Sorry for bad punctuation)"
74,"Apr 2, 2022",i think it is mother ?
74,"Apr 1, 2022","‚Ä¶you can definitely kill a werewolf with bullets though, they just need to be silver."
74,"Mar 31, 2022",i- I think it's dokja's mom
74,"Mar 31, 2022",NOT THE SAIKI K REFERENCE-
74,"Mar 31, 2022",oh mother... mother? v:
74,"Mar 30, 2022",mom?

74,"Mar 22, 2022",*kind of spoilers but if you remember last episodes then not really* hellooo mother
74,"Mar 22, 2022","So his mother? wasnt that flashback back from whatever episode where that scene showed his mother by his dead father (or someone else's) corpse? So their king looks that goofy because its his mother who knows how he would react, right? No one correct me as I can literally just go to the next episode(s)"
74,"Mar 22, 2022",I wonder who's that
74,"Mar 20, 2022",im sorry but the demon kings look so hot.
74,"Mar 19, 2022",I thinks its his mom?
74,"Mar 18, 2022","always sum damn author if not, I don't know who else she can be maybe sumbody he knew while reading or at his work or or or idk üòÇ"
74,"Mar 18, 2022","IT MUST BR THE WORK ""DARK REUNION"" "
74,"Mar 11, 2022",Am i the only one who thinks that was Dokja's mother??
74,"Mar 9, 2022",is his fourth wall still broken or did the artist just go overboard making him look scared/shocked. Maybe since she's not a character it doesn't work.
74,"Mar 6, 2022",Is that his mom??
74,"Mar 3, 2022",his mom?
74,"Mar 3, 2022",why do i feel that it's his mother üò≠üò≠
74,"Feb 25, 2022",i get the feeling that's his mom 
74,"Feb 19, 2022",ITS HIS MOM RIGHT ??? THATS MY GUESS AT LEAST
74,"Feb 19, 2022","I'm just guessing here: Is that his mom? O_O Silhouette is from the scene when Dokja's mom killed his dad. And these people look like they came from prison, its likely his mom was in prison for murder, right?"
74,"Feb 18, 2022",Mama oooooh??
74,"Feb 13, 2022",I think it's his mom 
74,"Feb 13, 2022",I'm just guessing that the lady is Dokja's mom
74,"Feb 12, 2022",I'm pretty sure it's his mom who escaped from prison and made a team of badass escapees
74,"Feb 11, 2022","Is it momma? Cuz the first person is from prison, they made it seem like his mom did something bad hence the ""You didn't see anything"" or ""She is mother, of course she'll survive"""
74,"Feb 10, 2022",so much I want to say. but I don't want to spoil anything. I've read the web novel 13 times.  you are in for a ride. 
74,"Feb 9, 2022","Omg, I think it's his m*****, the one who gave him a lot of traumas "
74,"Feb 5, 2022",omg is it his mom
74,"Feb 5, 2022",Mother?
74,"Feb 4, 2022","""on my first regression"" ""ON MY FIRST REGRESSION""???! Suyeon regresses???"

74,"Jan 12, 2022","there's a literal flashback to the scene with his mom after seeing the king, i haven't read the novel or anything but like, surely it's obvious, like, literally look at the scene set up"
74,"Jan 11, 2022","Oh hell no it's Dokja's ""mom""."
74,"Jan 8, 2022",It‚Äôs been hinted at that this man has a  lot of unresolved trauma and I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs him mom or whoever that person was in his flashbacks 
74,"Jan 8, 2022",THAT'S DEFINITELY HIS MOTHER
74,"Jan 1, 2022","I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs a family member or someone very close since he had very vibrant images in what looks to be a night gown. Maybe a sister or the terrible option of a mother? The seemed to be limp-ish pose so maybe a suicide attempt or some kind of abuse or violence related crime, she almost look like she was looking down or standing over something."
74,"Dec 31, 2021",is that his mom? hply shit.
74,"Dec 31, 2021",It his mother
74,"Dec 29, 2021",I'm surprised that nobody in the top comments are talking about the saiki k reference..
74,"Dec 27, 2021",Mommy?
74,"Dec 24, 2021","damn I can't wait for dokja to meet myeongoh again, webtoon readers you're gonna be in for a treat"
74,"Dec 23, 2021",its either his mother who probably killed someone and Dokja accidentally saw the dead body or maybe its his father üëÄ (judging from the flashbacks we've seen ) or maybe she's the author of TWSA . 
74,"Dec 18, 2021","Yeah, that's definitely his mother. The author's been foreshadowing that she was a convicted murderer this whole time, and back in the beginning, Dokja himself said that she would for sure be able to survive. Who else would be in a prison and already know who he is?"
74,"Dec 18, 2021","WAIT. might that be his mom? the bully once said that his mom was on the news and he has trauma bcs of her. since she is leading a group of prisoners, she might be his mom for real"
74,"Dec 17, 2021","Is this just some long winded way to describe the people that subscribe, and people that don't subscribe? demon kings are the ones that just co through the comics without subscribing or liking. And the people that support the comic by subscribing and liking are the constellations. ü§£probably not but this is a comic themed comic after all."
74,"Dec 16, 2021",Yeaongran Cho is hot...
74,"Dec 16, 2021",Her hair is like me tho...
74,"Dec 16, 2021",Wait what!? so they just gave him the meteorite?? is that good or bad?
74,"Dec 16, 2021",is that Anna Croft??
74,"Dec 16, 2021",":// I can‚Äôt find a single comment about the Kaido reference - come on, it‚Äôs the dark reunion"
74,"Dec 15, 2021",POSSIBLY THE MOM??? DOES ANYONE ELSE AGREE
74,"Dec 15, 2021",Shit. That‚Äôs the mom. Isn‚Äôt it. 
74,"Dec 13, 2021",Looks like his mum to me xD or a relative
74,"Dec 13, 2021",mark me down as scared and horny
74,"Dec 13, 2021",I don‚Äôt know why but I feel like it‚Äôs Dokja‚Äôs mom
74,"Dec 9, 2021",I'm only guessing if that's really her mom....this is giving me chills
74,"Dec 9, 2021","I know this sounds crazy, but somehow she seems like that obsessed lady he met before üôÅ or his mother"
74,"Dec 8, 2021",THE MOTHER??
74,"Dec 7, 2021",betting that's the actual author
74,"Dec 5, 2021","It‚Äôs his mom, right?! She killed his dad and was probably in prison when everything happened!"
74,"Dec 5, 2021","I think that's his mother..... judging from how it was mentioned that his mom was ""on the news"" I think she was on the news because she was arrested.... which is also why they didn't fight him."
74,"Dec 4, 2021",mom????
74,"Dec 4, 2021",I think it might be someone who he knew in like the normal world that's why she knew that it's dokja
74,"Dec 3, 2021",Either that's the author or his mom 
74,"Dec 2, 2021","yk what guys, it's so hard not to spoil but I'm just going to keep it myself as always HAHAHAHAHHA  there's a lot more more more chapters to read before you'll know who's the author aaand the foreshadowing from the start:))"
74,"Dec 2, 2021",Mumma??
74,"Dec 2, 2021",Is that Kaidou in one frame?? From saiki K. 
74,"Dec 1, 2021",every time I look at this couple bickering with each other I ship them . seriously üò≥ü§£
74,"Dec 1, 2021",That lady with the mask on is Kim Dokja's mom
74,"Nov 30, 2021","Huh, so a few theories:1: This mysterious character could be a relative of Dokja? Why: Yan said that she was just like Dokja, she knows and recognized him. And appears to be from a prison break out group. If I recall the small bits of memory from his brief trauma reveal showed that the mother possibly killed/did something terrible. So she was likely there, and likely shares traits of behavior/thinking Dokja does. |‚Üì|"
74,"Nov 29, 2021",Did I see who I think I saw among those constellations?
74,"Nov 29, 2021","Oh my gosh, what if that‚Äôs kdj‚Äôs mom‚Ä¶"
74,"Nov 29, 2021",I think that‚Äôs his mom
74,"Nov 26, 2021",yoo I'm excitedddd
74,"Nov 25, 2021",I guess that's the author- huge plot twist!!
74,"Nov 25, 2021",IS THAT- HIS MOM?!?!?!?!!
74,"Nov 25, 2021",just like the others seriously wondering if it's his mom or the author. even crazier what if the author is his mom? haha sorry I went really far out on a limb there
74,"Nov 24, 2021",DOKJA'S EOMMONIE!!!
74,"Nov 24, 2021",dokja mom is here yesyesyesyes
74,"Nov 23, 2021",sp really isnt wearing anything like dam if u read the novel like thats really hot 
74,"Nov 23, 2021",DUDE I UNINTENTIONALLY FOUND OUT WHO IS THAT WOMEN :P
74,"Nov 23, 2021",I thought that was anna croft for a secüòÇ
74,"Nov 23, 2021",love all the history that goes into this. Also is that his mom
74,"Nov 23, 2021",does she have The 4th Wall skill too?
74,"Nov 23, 2021",I wonder if they only knew him by him standing in the kings throne. Since they didn't participate I wonder what they did to get stronger. I might actually be his MOM!!!

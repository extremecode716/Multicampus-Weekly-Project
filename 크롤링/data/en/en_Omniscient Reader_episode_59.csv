59,"Jun 30, 2021","Thats really interesting, it seems like the past few chapters we have been delving into real people becoming characters, and this gives us some more info on it.  I wonder if eventually dokja and the gang will become characters, though I wouldnt be surprised if dokja is immune because he read the whole thing to the end"
59,"Jun 30, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" have warned the constellation of sillas but it didn't listen and is now laughing at it.] [5 coins have been sponsored.] //Edit 08032021: HBD TO OUR PROTAGONIST YJH!! 🎂🎂//Edit 08052021: didnt mentioned this before but it was secretive plotter who sponsored not sun wukong please do like the one commented this"
59,"Jun 30, 2021",Prisoner of the golden headband: I’ll give you money to embarrass this broke b*tch
59,"Jun 30, 2021",He probably became a character after Dokja took his pants. He got exposed to the elements and become one with them.
59,"Jun 30, 2021",bruh i bet even the fastpassers have more coins than what she offered

59,"Jun 30, 2021","Dokja has unlocked the ability "" Bitch Please! [Lvl1]"""
59,"Jun 30, 2021","I think the Prophets becoming characters are related to the number of chapters they read. Like for example if you read 34 chapters, then once the events goes beyond chapter 34, you slowly start being integrated into the story without noticing until you're a character. That's my theory at least. As for Sangah, Huiwon and Gilyeong, they are anomalies caused by Dokja's intervention so they remain unaffected. Idk, that's just my theory for now."
59,"Jun 30, 2021","Sun Wukon be laughing at the broke ass queen, by casually spending 3,500 coins "

It's hilarious how unbothered Dokja is with her tho (his face the whole time was 😒 and 😑 but he has been surrounded by a good-looking main cast can you blame him) , Seongguk even got the Dokja bonk treatment 😂 2,000 coins is so cheap compared to how much Dokja earned so far lol I love Sun Wukong just flexing in the background & it was cool to see Guan Yu. Also we need to make a petition to get Underwear-sshi some pants 😤"

59,"Jun 30, 2021","""she is pretty but she isn't my style. sangah is just as pretty"" okay gay boy"

59,"Aug 4, 2021","I LOVE how a constellation gifted 3,500 coins just because he wanted to show superiority against another constellation. I tried to imagine it in my own shoes and I would do the same if someone I support (not always financially, but more like they journey) happens to disrespect someone I hate."
59,"Aug 4, 2021","For some reason, I’m getting scared of the fact that the non-characters(?) are turning into characters"
59,"Aug 5, 2021",Hello! Just wanted to know it was the Secretive Plotter who gave the 3000 coins. May seem minor at this time but it is important to the character detail. Thank you!!!! :)

59,"Aug 4, 2021","it's funny how dokja was so unimpressed by everything about this actress lol, beauty? sangah is just as pretty. power? psh. money? broke. princess royalty? of a disadvantaged kingdom. the prisoner of the golden headband decided to join in sjsjsnjsjs"
59,"Jul 3, 2021",I think it's hilarious that dokja can just name drop all these constellations 
59,"Aug 4, 2021",Can they hit up a department store on the way so we can get this man some clothes?

59,"Jul 2, 2021","I love how Sun Wukong is a shit starter in this too. Giving Dokja 3,500 coins just cause he turned down 3,000 lol. Also how are the others slowly becoming characters?"
59,"Aug 5, 2021","I would like to point out in the novel it was actually Secretive Plotter that gave the 3000 coins. Understandable how things can get mixed up ❤️ while prisoner of the golden headband is awesome, we need to give plotter credit where it is due! Would be nice to have it corrected "
59,"Aug 4, 2021","Maybe I'm wrong, because I don't know till' which point the 9th renouncer read TWSA, but maybe the renouncers become characters after they don't know the ""future"" anymore. That still wouldn't explain why Sangah or Gilyeong aren't characters, but it's just a theory"
59,"Jun 30, 2021",this bout to be omniscient pantless man viewpoint
59,"Aug 5, 2021","Hello! Actually in the korean raws the one who gave 3000 coins was Secretive Plotter, NOT Prisoner of the Golden Headband. I'd greatly appreciate it if everyone can request for correction in the customer service so that the translator can correct this! Thank you! (Edit: I was initially requesting for comment flooding since I didn't know how to report it, but apparently you can report it through customer care! Please look at your Settings and Help to report^^)"
59,"Jun 30, 2021","Sooo people can become characters, this story has changed. Also he was flexing on her, put the queen to shame lol"
59,"Aug 4, 2021",Honestly I’m growing really fond of Prisoner of the Golden Headband
59,"Jun 30, 2021","I found it absolutely hilarious when wukong scoffed at the 3,000 coin offer and then gave him 3,000 coins. when I saw that I had to set my phone down to laugh so I wouldn't drop it lmao 😂😂"
59,"Aug 7, 2021","??? I could’ve sworn they corrected it to “secretive plotter” yesterday, why did they change it again!? Also. Prisoner of the secretive plotter. 😭😭😭 what kind of strange kinky nonsense is that???"

There’s a mistranslation to this chapter, it’s not Prisoner of the Golden Headband who gifted Kim Dokja 3,000 coins but it’s Secretive Plotter. This is a very bad mistranslation because evey small detail can be a bigger impact on future chapters 🙏"
59,"Aug 5, 2021","It was Secretive Plotter, and not Son Wukong, that sponsored the 3000 coins to KDJ...that's a bit of an important detail, so please fix it 🙏🙏🙏"
59,"Aug 5, 2021","Hi Webtoon! According to the korean raws, it was SECRETIVE PLOTTER WHO GAVE 3000 COINS, not the Prisona'er of the golden Headband. Not so big but its misleading. pls fix 🙏🙏🙏"

59,"Aug 5, 2021","In the novel, wasn't it Secretive Plotter that sponsored the 3000 coins, not Sun Wukong?"
59,"Aug 4, 2021","Secretive Plotter was the constellation who gifted the 3000 coins in the korean version, not Prisoner of the Golden Headband. It doesn't really affect the story all that much- but I don't know why webtoon changed it."

59,"Aug 3, 2021","I just wanted to share that I have just read ch66 and boy oh boy...! I did not understand why everyone were so agitated about the upcoming chapters, especially 65+.Yes 65 was pretty awesome, but making it to the top10 moments of the novel? that's going far.. But then THAT happened! And I swear, I fcking screamed, and had shivers and goosebumps (I even took a pic to show my brother lol). Guys! this is fcking lit. And yep, I'm going straight to the novel. I can't wait anymore or I might go nuts. "

59,"Aug 5, 2021","Poor Plotter, his 3000c became Wukong’s credit 😞 Now EN webtoon readers won’t know Dokja’s OG Sugar Daddy"

59,"Aug 4, 2021","""if only she knew the messages I was getting right now"""
59,"Aug 4, 2021",Maybe they become characters when they reach the point where they stopped reading the novel?
59,"Aug 4, 2021","I just love that Wukong was all ""Yo. this btch wack, she trying to get you for 3000....know what? here, have MY 3000 cause she's dmn ridiculous"""
59,"Jun 30, 2021","This entire chapter was who could flex on the queen of silly the most, The incarnations or the constellations."
59,"Aug 7, 2021","thank you for listening to us readers translation team! but I believe you forgot to erased the ""prisoner"" part because now it says prisoner of the secretive plotter 😭 thank you so much for changing it though!<3"
59,"Aug 5, 2021","hello translation team! i believe there was some translation error in the scene where constellation the great sage gave dokja 3,000 coins, it was supposed to be secretive plotter! well i know it wasn't that big difference but it would be a good hint as to find out secretive plotter real identity! we would be so thankful if you can correct it"
59,"Aug 4, 2021",I love how the pants keep coming up…
59,"Aug 4, 2021","I like the constellation prisoner of the golden headband. dude seems like a fun... person? legend? idk at this point, but they sure like to spend their coins on dokja, and that's definitely a plus"
59,"Aug 5, 2021","please correct the wrong translation in webtoon...It is secretive plotter who gave kim dokja the 3,000 coins and not Prisoner of the Golden Headband"
59,"Aug 4, 2021",I think at this point the prisoner of the golden headband may as well b his supporting constellation. Like my man is liter acting like us watching to see what wild thing happens next.

59,"Jul 1, 2021",Can I just say how much I love this comic. I’ve paid for it since the day it came out
59,"Jun 30, 2021",[The constellation Lord of the Bleeding Wallet unsuccessfully hides his jealousy at the nickname of the Lord of the Beautiful Beard.][5 coins have been sponsored.] 
59,"Aug 8, 2021",'prisoner of secretive plotter' ...I know we all thinking that one scene. I'm sure of it 🤣 that's strangely accurate😂
59,"Aug 7, 2021","that mistranslation modifier [Constellation ""Prisoner of the Secretive Plotter""] sent me 😂 reminded me of a certain constellation that got kidnapped to n'gai forest at one point in the story, and if the modifier was for 'that constellation', it actually kind of fitting and this give me a fanfic idea 😂"
59,"Aug 6, 2021",Secretive plotter flexing his coins n sponsoring the same amount of coins to dokja as made by jiwon had me laughing seriously 😂
59,"Aug 5, 2021",Aah! How do we suggest for a correction in this webtoon. Prisoner of the Golden Headband wasn't the one who gifted the 3k coins but Secretive Plotter! Novel Readers where are you! SOS
59,"Aug 5, 2021",hello translation team! I think there was a slight mistake in translation because it should have been Secretive Plotter instead of Prisoner of the golden headband that sponsored the coins and it might seem minir but plays a part later on in the story! Thank you so so much for the hard work i hope you have lovely days!! <3<3<3
59,"Aug 4, 2021","LMAO, I love how Wukong gifted coins to mock the offer given to Dokja."
59,"Aug 4, 2021",prisoner of the golden headband RICH rich 
59,"Aug 4, 2021","I think they become characters as they pass the point they stopped reading. Seongguk shouldn't be able to recognize Jiwon because according to Dokja she appears in a point of the story Seongguk should have stopped reading. If she appeared, that point has now passed."
59,"Aug 4, 2021",I'm so glad I took that Korea History course last year; I actually understand all the references and I love it! 
59,"Aug 4, 2021","20,000 coins? I’d let Dokja buy me for 2 😬😬"
59,"Aug 4, 2021","Wait, small theory... what if this situation happens over and over? And the author is one who records the events of the story? Then the next world it happens to gets to read the story before everything happens?? The events of the previous story becoming part of a new story? This would explain everyone slowly getting turned into characters... and hold up...... we're reading this........... frick."
59,"Jun 30, 2021",KDJ standard for beauty is the sunfish bastard
59,"Aug 8, 2021","I figured it out, Dokja's come down with a severe case of main character syndrome, and it's contagious, so everyone around him is being given side character syndrome"
59,"Aug 8, 2021",I’m pretty sure Dokja is the author and the reader. The reason people are turning into characters is because as they interact with him they written in the story as they become a part of his memory. I think the npcs aren’t actual npc and are actually real people that made it into the story. Though I suppose there are holes in my theory and it’ll be disproved real soon
59,"Aug 6, 2021","I'm seeing bunch of mistranslation and change of names here, I'm scared that it will badly affect the story"
59,"Aug 5, 2021",i hope the translation team notices & fixes it bc it’s supposed to be sp who sponsored the coins not swk…
59,"Aug 5, 2021",lmao it was secretive plotter that gave him the coins actually 
59,"Aug 5, 2021","Man I'm hopelessly in love with dokja. His intelligence, his calculative nature, the way he carries himself and the way he is always 2 steps ahead of both the incarnations and constellations... His character is just ✨*muah* chefs kiss✨ Anyone could have been the Omniscient reader, but to be able to use that information and do something with it is a whole another thing. Man intelligence is damn sexy. "
59,"Aug 4, 2021","In korean raw, it was secretive plotter who donated coins, not prisoner of the golden headband. Thanks for translation, but i think  they should fix it. (MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD)"
59,"Aug 4, 2021","hold on.. is this going into some kind of “breaking the 4th wall” territory where dokja and everyone eventually become characters and we, the actual readers, are the “REAL” omniscient reader"
59,"Aug 4, 2021",i love how all the constellations are just going through bruh moments
59,"Aug 4, 2021",She don’t know our boy making that passive income 
59,"Aug 4, 2021","I love how this story is told basically from the perspective of a reader, cuz normally when a super cool super hot chick shows up, everyone would be swooning over her while she shows off. But Dokja, as his lovable omniscient reader self, is having none of it 🤣🤣🤣. Like, you’re not as cool as you think hun, step aside *Dokja fabulously walking past with his ever growing amount of coins, power, and style*"
59,"Aug 4, 2021","in the novel(orv), Sangah's knowledge flexing is much more painful for Min Jiwon. They didn't explain much in manhwa the details but Min Jiwon didn't finish school. I forgot if it's gradeshool or highschool. She's not that smart so she used her next big asset. Her beauty. To become n actress. So when Sangah flexed her knowledge it's like a bitchslap to her. It even said in the novel that Dokja pitied her coz of her circumstances."
59,"Aug 10, 2021",Prisoner of the secretive plotter? Can’t help but laugh as a novel reader
59,"Aug 7, 2021",When this first came out I subscribed and then ignored it for an entire year. Why you ask? So that I could binge it! 😍 And now I have to join the rest of you in waiting. 😭
59,"Aug 7, 2021",Absolutely hilarious how the constellations just gave him what was offered
59,"Aug 5, 2021","I really love how the constellations have their own personalities, really gives it a touch of humor when we see them acting like a regular comment section would. Arguing, discussing between themselves, hating on characters, rooting for certain characters, flexing for the sake of it, etc"
59,"Aug 5, 2021",actually it was secretive plotter that gave the coins not prisoner of the golden headband
59,"Aug 5, 2021","“Sangah is just as pretty”, all of my speaking rights, I willingly give it to Dokja. 🙇‍♂️"
59,"Aug 4, 2021",I really like the fact that there are small conversation between character to maintain curious feeling of character which is absent in novel .
59,"Aug 4, 2021",Not really a spoiler but I really love how all of whom I call the 'Original 4' have always been watching Dokja since Day 1 and basically supporting him throughout the story.
59,"Aug 4, 2021",Spoiler alert they are all characters even dokja in a WEBTOON.
59,"Aug 4, 2021",Lmao I’m really liking this bit with what’s his name’s lack of pants😂😂  (forgive me for not remembering his name) 
59,"Aug 4, 2021","Ma'am, he's worth more that 20,000 coins"

59,"Jul 1, 2021","For those whose hunger haven't been reduced with all the fast pass episodes, try reading the novel. At first I vowed to not peak at the novel but I'm already halfway through it now. Once you've started reading the novel you won't be able to stop until you've reached the end and you'll see the webtoon version differently. "
59,"Jun 30, 2021","This was me, my brother and father when I was a wee lad. My brother and I would find spare change and over a month compare our finds. Then DAD comes in and says ""Hey, guys want to go to a restaurant?"" The whole family is in this as he is the one paying. At the end of it all, he secludes me and my brother and shows us the bill.

59,"Aug 6, 2021",Tiny spoiler:                                    Kinda funny how Huiwon is the icon for this chapter when her only appearance is one panel telling us we won't be seeing her for a while.
59,"Aug 6, 2021","A bit of korean historical comments: In korean peninsula, there were 3 countries called Goguryeo/Baekje/Silla. Silla unified 3 countries, but some internal division grew as the time passing by. So, Silla was divided as Silla, Hu(later) goguryeo, Hu baekje. Hu goguyreo changed the name as Goryeo, and they unified 3 countries again. Also: the name ""Korea""  came from Goryeo!"
59,"Aug 6, 2021",Please give that poor guy a pair of pants. 😂😂
59,"Aug 5, 2021","I have an interesting theory! You know how all the people who've read the original series of TWSA never really passed the 50th episode? What if you remain a ""normal"" person up to the point where you dropped TWSA? Of course this disregards the two who are close to the main character who've never read TWSA, but then again what if they haven't ""turned"" into ""characters"" because they were never supposed to be characters. Just some food for thought."

59,"Aug 4, 2021",It's obvious sangah is better than all of us here
59,"Aug 4, 2021","disappointed in myself for not guessing that Guan Yu was the general being mentioned.. (bit of a Three Kingdoms nerd). I'm a sucker for guys with long hair in traditional garments, but.. best looking is still Seongguk. (love his outfit)"

59,"Oct 10, 2021",someone give him pants😭😭😭
59,"Oct 9, 2021","I wonder if Seongguk becoming a character is based on his knowledge of the plot? He was quite low in number with the Prophets, he didn't read many chapters, so with all the changes to the original storyline & quick plot progression (ex: beating scenario 5 so early), maybe he has no 'new' intel left & couldn't be considered a Prophet anymore. So he was stripped of the Attribute. Or something like that."

59,"Aug 11, 2021",So  once the renouncer reaches the chapter  they stopped reading they become a character ? Interesting. That would make dokja immune because he read the whole thing
59,"Aug 9, 2021",Wait so ur telling me they sell all sorts of items in the shop but not a pair of pants for the poor dude in his boxers 💀 
59,"Aug 8, 2021",I feel like once the renouncers hit the point in novel they stopped reading they become characters.

59,"Aug 7, 2021","Wait, if a person can become a character can a character become a human?"
59,"Aug 7, 2021",here's a  theory: maybe seongguk turn into a character in twsa because he didn't read that much. he was knowing what's gonna happen so he lived the story for while but  as soon as the chapters his read ended he blended in story and turned into a real character.  so if it's like that that's why sangah and others never will be a character because they didn't read it. I know it doesn't make sense but just a thought 
59,"Aug 7, 2021","2 things come to mind as to why he lost the attribute and ... memories I guess. either he lost it cuz he tried to talk about it or mixed reality with the novel. or two, this was as far as he had read and therefore his attribute no longer counted as a bonus and thus removed."

59,"Aug 5, 2021",I love how easily he keeps a straight face while doing crap like slapping ppl on the head 😂
59,"Aug 5, 2021",I'll bet that readers become characters after they have passed the point where they stopped reading. So Dokja will probably be the only non-character by the end.

59,"Aug 4, 2021","It'd be a fitting end to have all the supporting crew slowly becoming characters and then for Dokja to check his own status sometime at the end and find he has become a character too. It'd be even crazier if he realized the events of his life were all within the confines of a comic, and then had to live with knowing the story would end soon. "

Edit: Did anyone else notice Jiwon has Military Command Lv. 2 twice? think it was an error, but can't remember what her skills are suppose to be."

59,"Apr 7, 2022",Dokja with the absolute Chad move. Jiwon's face when Dokja offered to buy her for 20K 😂I wonder if the 4th wall is stopping Dokja from becoming immersed in the world like Seongguk. Does that mean that Gilyeong and Sangah will also become characters?
59,"Jan 15, 2022",i couldn't stop laughing at how much flexing he was boasting about those coins

59,"Oct 23, 2021","LMFAO i laughed way too hard ""secretive plotter has gifted you 3000 coins"" just like that 💀"
59,"Oct 15, 2021",I believe Seonguk Lee & Minseob Jung's becoming characters under profile is partly to blame on Dokja. He imposed the death oath to not act as individuals anymore making them NPC's/Characters. Whereas Gilyoung and Sangah also due to Dokja'a influence. They're not readers but can still influence a change as individuals therefore not characters/NPC's(?)

59,"Aug 8, 2021",I have an interesting theory - anyone who finds out that the world has turned into a novel becomes a character after they pass the part of the novel where they stopped.  The only reason that doesn't apply to Dokja is because of his 4th wall attribute.  That explains some of why seemingly only the prophets have become characters and losing their revelator status
59,"Aug 7, 2021",I cant belive I have to wait this is the best series I have ever read I really want more
59,"Aug 7, 2021",incredible. if people can turn into characters can the opposite happen if not then can avatars become characters and just be a little overpowered

59,"Aug 5, 2021","I have a theory I think sangah  is the autor of the story because at the beginning she managed the situation very well and maybe the reason why dokja can't read her profile is because she's the author and also she has been through many different stages and thats impressive because she doesn't look like a very strong woman but she is a strong woman and that' makes her very mysterious , it's just my opinion."

59,"Jan 14, 2022","What if twsa was never really a novel with characters but a true story in the first place,, like a peek into the future with real people "
59,"Jan 8, 2022",kinda sad seeing him turn into a character
59,"Dec 28, 2021",give my man some pants 🤣
59,"Dec 24, 2021",this story really got more depth!
59,"Dec 19, 2021","It’s really cool that the power of the reader is so strong and we’re all at home reading along with the MC getting reinforced for it, I love it "
59,"Dec 18, 2021",The constellation was too stunned to speak 
59,"Dec 15, 2021",did Seongguk walk around with boxer since his pants are taken by dokja
59,"Dec 8, 2021",Dokja said “I’m ✨inmune to beauty✨ but that protagonist…”
59,"Dec 4, 2021","the secretive plotter really be like ""oh you use that for bribery? i use that for gifting"""

59,"Aug 25, 2021",Huiwon is so fire
59,"Aug 25, 2021",All I think about this episode is about the drama Hwarang HSHSHHS 
59,"Aug 25, 2021","Okay so hear me out, 1) I think that the Secretive Plotter is the author of TWSA and 2) I think that he book os changing but the world is still the TWSA one and its just another universe now, bceuase the reader is now in the story which disrupted the verses, basically the multiverse theory and now everybody he knows is turning into a main side character of the story because he is now the protagonist?? and this all started with the death of the crazy guy in the train??? idk, its just my theories."
59,"Aug 25, 2021",I fully thought he was gonna say she was an ... adult entertainer... lady of the night... a 🌽 🌟 
59,"Aug 24, 2021",very intriguing
59,"Aug 23, 2021","What does it truly mean to be a character? Like, can anyone become a character? Does it depend on if you come into contact with Dokja or something? "
59,"Aug 19, 2021",AHHHH GUANYU!! I love how this WEBTOON is featuring historic characters
59,"Aug 19, 2021","Here I am, searching about these historical characters and learning about Korean history."
59,"Aug 18, 2021",GILYEONG RETURNS LET'S GOOOOO! 
59,"Aug 16, 2021",Can someone remind me what Dokja did to the other shrine? All I remember is that he did something and then he got some items. 
59,"Aug 11, 2021",Ahhh yes the god of war Guan Yu what else isn't new to me?
59,"Aug 11, 2021",I love how the constellations and his own sales matched with her offers xD
59,"Aug 11, 2021","ok... her offer from her 3000 coins, and just after that secretive platter giving him 3000 coins. That was brutal. That was incredible. I love secretive plotter consetelation, this move just destroyed her."
59,"Aug 9, 2021",Wait what if they become characters after the last thing they read happens 👁👄👁 so If u read to the 3rd scenario then after the 3rd scenario happens u become a character  
59,"Aug 9, 2021","I've been reading this story for a while and bro i don't see the final👁️👄👁️, but also i can't stop of reading this cuz its really interesting 🤡🔫"
59,"Aug 8, 2021",this is so  gooddddd
59,"Aug 8, 2021",Does someone know why this Webtoon has such a sharp decline in likes these past few weeks
59,"Aug 8, 2021",This is such an intriguing series. I love this so much! Are normal people turning into characters? What does that mean in the long run? 🤔 So excited to find out!
59,"Aug 7, 2021",that's new 
59,"Aug 6, 2021",can I know how to earn some coins? I'm just new here :((
59,"Aug 5, 2021",oh I see if you play along to the story you become a character and if the world doesn't end the they get new people for the act
59,"Aug 5, 2021",OMG THE ART IS BEAUTIFUL. ESCPECIALLY THE CONSTELLATIONS!!
59,"Aug 5, 2021",What does it mean to become a character tho? It must be significant if it’s been mentioned so many times
59,"Aug 5, 2021","My guess is that people ""accidently"" became characters by doing exactly what the author predicted. Maybe not everyone would be capable of murdering their BFF but sure there was this one girl who hd all the personality traits to do something like that, that's maybe how they were selected as main characters 🤔 idk, all thus situation makes me think that the author has some kind of power greater than a constalation like a God, so knowing that stuff could be easy for him... I think🤔"
59,"Aug 5, 2021",I thought she was a porn star and that's why the guys knew her whoops...
59,"Aug 5, 2021",Special skill dispel evil is activated.. SMACK

59,"Aug 5, 2021",i miss Gilyeong its nice to see him again 
59,"Aug 5, 2021",Ooof!!!
59,"Aug 5, 2021",Is that Pepsi's logo on the door?! 😂
59,"Aug 5, 2021",Is it cuz dokja took his phone/copy of TWSA???
59,"Aug 5, 2021",idk why but I freaking love this awesome webtoon *chef's kiss* 
59,"Aug 5, 2021",wukong be flexing
59,"Aug 5, 2021",WHAT IF. Twsa is a loop. once it finishes everyone becomes characters and thier memories area wiped replaced with the memories of them in twsa. and then later on new people will come and whoever finishes the whole story becomes the main character 🤔
59,"Aug 5, 2021","lmaoooooo the accuracy of guan yu is insane. the reason there was a shrine for him all the way in korea is because he was basically perfect — except for his ego. his intelligence, tactical planning, power, and his sense of honour as well as his appearance were basically flawless, all the way down to his beard, which was so beautiful that cao cao had allegedly once wrapped it in a cloth to make sure it didn’t get damaged. however, he was excessively arrogant, so he died underestimating his enemy."
59,"Aug 5, 2021","me: isn't that the outfit Taehyung had on in that one movie... what's the name?Omniscient reader: hwar-
me: HWARANG YEAH THATS IT"
59,"Aug 5, 2021",Very interesting! 
59,"Aug 4, 2021","So, when these people just become characters.....is that like the death of a thinking person?"
59,"Aug 4, 2021",Happy Birthday Joonghyuk!!! 🥳🥳🥳
59,"Aug 4, 2021",dokja be doin a hard flex with his moneh
59,"Aug 4, 2021",any conspiracy ideas on how he became a character 
59,"Aug 4, 2021",Sangah be serving LOOKS this chapter.. 
59,"Aug 4, 2021",why do I feel like Dokja is going to become a regressor at the end
59,"Aug 4, 2021","ive always not quite understoof how someone became a character even after reading the novel, like i get the gist of it but not really and am still confused so i hope reading the webtoon will help more"
59,"Aug 4, 2021",dokja when he was getting blown away by lady of brocades loud voice and said shes not well versed with history (as in wow he looks so dumb n cute)
59,"Aug 4, 2021",I'm late on YJH's birthday AH Happy birthday hot mf stuff
59,"Aug 4, 2021","I thought the non-chara would become  characters in the order they dropped the story in their lives, but then Sangah and Gilyeong didn't even read it as far as we know. So it can't be it. That's interesting. "
59,"Aug 4, 2021","so I think that if dokja knew them before the apocalypse began then he wouldn't be able to see them as characters, but if he only met them afterwards then they have the potential to become characters. It seems sokka has much more influence on the world than he might think. Also it will be very interesting when we finally meet his mom who I assume won't be a character either. edit: fricking autocorrect turned dokja into sokka 😑"
59,"Aug 4, 2021",are we just gonna ignore the fact that my guy is walking around without pants 😭
59,"Aug 4, 2021",maybe you become a character if they get past the chapters you've read
59,"Aug 4, 2021",bro wukong is just flexing his rich-ness
59,"Aug 4, 2021","the concept of ""becoming a character"" is super interesting and im excited to see how it's explored"

59,"Aug 4, 2021",Wow Dokja likes Sangha then any one else 
59,"Aug 4, 2021",Happy birthday Yoo Jonghyuk i love you 💜💜

59,"Aug 4, 2021","I’ve read most of the novel, but I haven't finished it because I feel like my heart will break if I do. (;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`)"

59,"Aug 4, 2021",um I'm really confused on the power system in this webtoon like why is certain constellations more rich than others is it based on game no why characters with less fame have offered more coins than this broke bitch lol just saying Ethier the system is broken or this just one broke ass bitch I pick the ladder how bout you all

59,"Aug 4, 2021","I have a theody that the the constellation Prisoner of the Golden Headband is Sun Wukong. Which makes sense since the monkey king has a golden headband that the buddha used to keep him in line. He's also immensely popular and powerful, so it makes sense that he'd be a very powerful constellation too"
59,"Aug 4, 2021",Happy birthday!!!

59,"Aug 4, 2021",Secretive plotter is hilarious. But prisoner of the secretive plotter is kim dokja lmaooo
59,"Aug 4, 2021","I... I'm scared of this strange notion they're going on about with people who are being ""designated"" as characters from TWSA as if these people didn't exist in the real world before the Dokkaebi showed up. When did the premise become ""Dokja was isekai'd into the world of TWSA"" rather than ""the events written of in TWSA are now becoming a reality""? Why are we suddenly acting as if these people aren't real?"
59,"Aug 4, 2021",BWAHAHAH THE MESSAGES

Something tells me that this transformation into characters is the Author's way of helping Dokja, but maybe our secret Constellation helping Saenah is actually the Author using her as a chosen Avatar."

Dokja: no, to buy YOU 
King of beauty: 👁️👄👁️"
59,"Jun 30, 2021",to me becoming a characters is inevitable if you haven’t fully completed TWSA. basically you become apart of the story/a character once the chapter or events you read up to coincides and catches up to the “real world”/real time
59,"Jun 30, 2021",Does this whole thing only take place there or is it a worldwide event?  I would love to know what is happening elsewhere in a spinoff or substory.
59,"Jun 30, 2021",I wonder how many coins Dokja actually has!?
59,"Jun 30, 2021",I really feel like the people turning into characters is coming out of no where. Now it seems that the scenario is that they are IN twsa instead of twsa being a prophecy or the author being a prophet like I’ve thought to believe until now. I’m a bit on edge of this not making sense but it’s still really interesting.
59,"Jun 30, 2021",It has been a while since I have read a series as good as this
59,"Jun 30, 2021",And the plot thickens!

Me: Secretive plotter be flexing with his coins. so Jiwon you are a nobody."
59,"Sep 6, 2022","oh i think i kind of understand the concept of real people becoming character here. Sangah and Gilyeong never read the novel in the first place so they are considered as ""strangers"" by the novel and the author. meanwhile, the renouncer are the ones who read the novel to certain chapters. if they are still alive now in the future chapters where they have stopped reading, they will lose their ability as renouncer and became part of the novel characters who also play roles in the novel."
59,"Sep 4, 2022",Uhm idk if this is a spoiler or  not but this is just a theory for now what if seongguk is becoming more of a character because he's only reached a certain level of reading twsa but sangah and gilyeong's profiles still can't be viewed and still remain human because they have never red twsa 
59,"Sep 2, 2022",I love how the constellations are giving him coins that the woman offer 🤣 she really thought she'll win while he is getting coins even without asking lol

59,"Mar 17, 2022",damnnn. that's like saying if you forget all of the novel you become a character that's messed up if u think about it 😭😭
59,"Mar 14, 2022",secretive plotter is the best constellation so far lolll
59,"Mar 13, 2022",He’s making his own story and he’s the protagonist 
59,"Mar 10, 2022","Ok so... Theory. What if ""Secretive Plotter"" is someone as important as the king of the dokkaebi? This doesnt count as spoiler btw since I havent read the rest yet- but anyway- during the earlier episodes, dokja thought of ""Secretive Plotter"" as a common constellation. However, due to how much ""Secretive Plotter"" has been appearing, I think he is probably going to end up being a pretty powerful character, just one we don't have much info on as of rn."
59,"Mar 3, 2022",there big reveal of him becoming a character was made much less dramatic since he still doesnt have any trousers.....
59,"Feb 14, 2022",I am having some doubts. Jihye is also a character but she existed along with others as seen in first scenario where she killed her friend to be alive. Same with delusion demon guy. Then what makes someone a real peraon and not the character. Aa far as i know the ones whose profile dokja cant see were supposed to have died but are alive. Then again huiwon who was supposed to have died also exists and has a character profile too.. I am confused how are certain people different from others?

59,"Apr 20, 2022",I'm sorry but why am I starting to see some resemblances of Dokja in gilyeong??? especially the eyes??
59,"Apr 20, 2022",20000 coins but can’t buy underwear or clothes. Must like the robe
59,"Apr 19, 2022",Secretive plotter is savage lmao
59,"Apr 12, 2022",Dang so everyone becomes a character at some point. That's kind of scary
59,"Apr 5, 2022",He became a character? Does that mean the characters are becoming more “real” I know they’re human in this novel but like real as in dokja’s world if that makes sense.
59,"Apr 5, 2022","secretive plotter be like- *scoffs, here u go boy 3000 coins, enjoy"

59,"Mar 27, 2022","maybe the ""prophets"" or ""disciples"" become novel characters once they reached or finished the part of the story where they left off. just an early reader speculation though, still alot of chapters to read. pretty great webtoon imma say"
59,"Mar 23, 2022",kinda feel like the 'real people's and the characters are slowly starting to sync into the characters of the novel ...
59,"Mar 23, 2022",dokja said that jiwon( is not her type) is pretty and sangah is just as pretty so this implies that he doesnt like sangah (kinda feel like sangah like him thou) 
59,"Feb 13, 2022","I’m guessing since he stopped reading at the prologue, he’s no longer aware of the ongoing story and is now a character. Which means only Dokja will remain aware since he read till the end. "
59,"Feb 9, 2022",Damn he flexed disnxisnlsnxie I LOVE IT 
59,"Feb 9, 2022",I love how she was offering him pennies and the other constellations were just throwing thousands at him 😂😂😭😭
59,"Feb 8, 2022","is my first time that I heard or read surname Min in webtoon or other reading books, that good ,could she be Min yoon-gi's relative ?(I'm not gonna be only army here right?)"
59,"Feb 6, 2022",i feel like once the plot of the story gets beyond what the real person knows they’ll become a character 
59,"Feb 6, 2022",How could a real person just become a character?
59,"Feb 5, 2022",imagine turning into a side character 
59,"Feb 5, 2022","HAHAHAHA Secretive Plotter be like, Oh you asking him for 3k coins? Nah imma give him 3k coins for free just to keep walking away from you 😂"

59,"Nov 24, 2021",When and where did dokja get shoes
59,"Nov 21, 2021",be interesting if they become characters after the amount of chapters they read passed already 
59,"Nov 19, 2021",hwang seungmin...a beautiful world where hwang hyunjin and kim seungmin married
59,"Nov 17, 2021","Wait okay why is Dokja confused that Seongguk knows who that lady is? He’s read the early chapters of TWSA and she’s a character in it so wouldn’t it make sense that he knows? Unless… it’s because Seongguk hasn’t gotten far enough to meet her and Dokja knows that, so it’s weird for him to know who she is since only characters in TWSA would know shes an actress in that world…? Someone plz explain ahhh"

59,"Nov 14, 2021",it's amazing how overpowered he is compared to others when he has no constellation.
59,"Nov 13, 2021",I have a felling they might also start looking their memory as they start to become a character.  
59,"Nov 11, 2021",So sooner or later Everyone is gonna turn into character
59,"Nov 10, 2021",guys what does it mean if they become a character? Besides the whole depersonalization. does it mean anything to the story?
59,"Nov 9, 2021",i think once they take on a constellation they become characters
59,"Nov 9, 2021","Oof,I feel kiiinda bad for her,but I mean,a queen that isnt rich? Thats new,I thought kings and queens had a shiz ton of fortnues,but I guess I was wrong"

59,"Nov 7, 2021",What? How do you become a character? What does that mean exactly? Is there a real difference? I always thought that TWSA became real not that the real world became TWSA but where exactly ends the reality and starts the fiction? Interesting...

59,"Nov 10, 2021","so this just partially confirmed my theory, so my theory is that this isn't the first time this has happened. I'm guessing that all the readers will probably become characters (except Dokja maybe) but this might happen with each of the regressions. I know it sounds kinda dumb but idk🤷‍♀️"

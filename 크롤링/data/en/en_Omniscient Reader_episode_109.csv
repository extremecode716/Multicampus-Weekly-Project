Episode,Date,Review
109,"Jun 15, 2022","I'M GUESSING WE ALL HAD THE SAME EXPRESSIONS AS THE ENFORCERS IN THAT PANEL? BECAUSE THAT SMILE AND ""KEKEKE"" IS BEAUTIFUL I'M GONNA CRY"
109,"Jun 15, 2022","THE ENFORCERS ACTUALLY FLATTERED BIHYUNG, BUT I GUESS IT WAS CUT OFF. // [Dokkaebi Bihyung. He is a very good dokkaebi. Look at his humility. He has the integrity of a streamer who ignores everything and immerses himself in the scenarios. It is different from you and the dokkaebis who only wear luxurious clothing.]Bihyung had a shy expression on his face. He didn't know that his poverty would help him in this way."
109,"Jun 15, 2022",That last panel though üò≠
109,"Jun 15, 2022",remember kids. punishable with a fee just means legal for a price.
109,"Jun 15, 2022",That creepy smile the enforcers made is fantastically evil.üëè
109,"Jun 15, 2022","If we divide Dokja's total coins: 205, 902 by 500, he'll get to hit Paul exactly 411 times before going broke ü§©üí´"
109,"Jun 15, 2022",Paul: Is it too late to say sorry? Dokja: (opens wallet)
109,"Jun 15, 2022","Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy you a private meeting with Paul.. same thing"
109,"Jun 15, 2022",Bro even the enforcers knew what Dokja was doingüòÇ that‚Äôs why they allowed the meeting.
109,"Jun 15, 2022",Dokja: I want a private meeting with him üëâüèæüôÄEnforcers: ü§©ü§© we got time for that üòàüòà
109,"Jun 15, 2022",I know ya‚Äôll are smiling like crazy people too with this episode lol
109,"Jun 15, 2022","Dokja: *approaches Paul*.                                  Paul: ""Hang on, why do I hear boss music?"" "
109,"Jun 15, 2022","Those last two shots of Dokja are really sad. Yeah he is getting some revenge, but he already knows it doesn't change anything or remove his guilt for how it played out. He is following through because he believes its the right thing to do to keep his promises. He seems so empty here."
109,"Jun 15, 2022","Be me.Wonder if the enforcers were smirking cause they're evil or something. 
Finish chapter. 
Realize your smirking as evilly as the enforcers

Get rekt Paul"
109,"Jun 15, 2022","Dokja Fr went ‚ÄúScrew the rules, I have Money‚Äù"
109,"Jun 15, 2022","I can only imagine the guards are us, smiling like true villains at interesting events. Really wish he could stream this beating, I can only imagine the constellations hooting and hollering at a satisfying beating to someone making a tear jerking scenario, especially because it‚Äôs a dokkebi getting their arse whooped "
109,"Jun 15, 2022","It's insanely satisfying to watch Dokja pummel the crap out of Paul, but that thousand yard stare of his.... Dokja is not ok right now. This poor dude worked so hard to change the tragic fate of a girl who suffered so much, only for this slime bag to flip the script upside down and exploit the system for the sake of punishing the incarnations he assumed were below him. I don't think there's much of a scheme this time. I think Dokja is just fed up with the bullshit and intends to unleash that."
109,"Jun 15, 2022",That last panel reminds me of Anya‚Äôs ‚ÄúHeh‚Äô expression. üòÇüòÇ
109,"Jun 15, 2022",sweet justice. and the smirk from the enforcers omg. i about died laughing
109,"Jun 15, 2022",My man legit said he'd pay the tax... oof. I look forward to many follow up hits like that one hehehe.
109,"Jun 15, 2022",This by far was my most satisfying fast pass for this series yet. Just when this was starting to feel so predictable this loss and Mc quick wit to get even is very refreshing oh that hit was cathartic asf and I really appreciate how the build up of hate for Paul isn't being dragged our on getting some feel good licks in at least... looking at you Tower of God. 10 out of 10 I wish they gave MC more menacing shots tho like they do for solo leveling tho
109,"Jun 18, 2022","""Private Meeting"" was just code for ""Dokkaebi Pinata"" lmao"
109,"Jun 15, 2022","AHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA!  GET REKT, YOU OVERPRIVELEGED CROSS BETWEEN A MOUTAIN GOAT AND A POMERANIAN. This was worth the wait, OMG. Yessssss."
109,"Jun 15, 2022",Amassed the most coins out of any player (presumably) just so he can beat up Paul for 20 minutes....that's my kind of petty ü§£
109,"Jun 15, 2022",Lol the enforcers knew exactly what Dokja had in mind. ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ
109,"Jun 15, 2022","In case anyone's curious, Dokja can afford 411 punches. Get rekt Paul üëª"

109,"Jul 20, 2022",I did the math- Dokja can more or less hit Paul about 411 times until he kind of runs low in money so üëÄüëÄ
109,"Jun 15, 2022","I really thought Kim Dokja was going to come up with some brilliant scheme to benefit from Paul getting arrested. I mean, I wasn't expecting it to be in THAT way but it works all the same for me. Paul deserves to sufferüòà"
109,"Jun 15, 2022",It's like the super rich people who still swear even though it costs 10k an f-bomb.

109,"Jul 21, 2022",can someone explain the rules? I'm still confused as to what Paul did wrong to get punished. didn't the majority of d constellations agreed with d scenario enforcement at the time it was enforced? does it not count now that they left? I'm confused.
109,"Jul 21, 2022",This is the moment I've been waiting to see since they started the adaptation of the novel. The idea of punching a dokaebi seems so satisfying.

109,"Jul 22, 2022",Dokja is the definition of 'Fuck You Money'.
109,"Jul 21, 2022",I'm not surprised that Dokja called a private meeting with him. He basically had to watch his adopted daughter die in front of him. I would have done the same.

109,"Jul 21, 2022",Dokja really did finesse Paul. I had no idea what his intentions were with the private meeting. I wondered if it was blackmail or something but just plain old kicking his ass is so satisfying to watch. The enforcers when they heard Dokja wanted a private meeting with Paul. Kekekeke. The most cathartic punch ever and Paul realizing Dokja had enough coins to beat him up üòÅ

109,"Jul 21, 2022",enforcers literally be like KEKW
109,"Jul 21, 2022","Dokja's expression in the end hurt me. The bitterness in his face when he said he earned the coins thanks to Paul... Serves him right, I hope he suffers for many years to come for hurting my baby Yuseung ‚úãüèª and the way Bihyeong reacted was so Dokja üòÇ he's learning some tricks now"
109,"Jul 21, 2022",Can the constellations see him beating Paul up? They‚Äôll def keep giving dokja more money just to see it keep going lmao

109,"Jul 20, 2022","If he doesn't get any donations, he has 501 hits max. But seeing a Dokkaebi getting the crap being beaten out of him? I'm certain the Constellations would pay plenty to see such a unique event unfold!"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",the cliffhangers this comic gives is downright rude. I wanna know what happens next! Don't cut me off like that. üò©üò©üò©

109,"Jul 20, 2022","bihyung was adorable in this chapter specially in the part where he got flattered by the enforcers, i actually wanted to see shy bihung but i guess it had to get cut off due to maximum panels in webtoon"

109,"Jul 20, 2022",nice.

109,"Jul 20, 2022","When I saw that my favorite webtoon has a new episode, I doubted if I should read it or not, but because I'm stubborn I read it till the last panel and this is the first time that I felt satisfied by the cliffhanger( Íàç·¥óÍàç)"
109,"Jul 20, 2022","Sigh, I still can't get over it. "
109,"Jul 20, 2022",these 'constellations' get on my nerves man. it's like watching how the media treats an artist unfairly üòÇüòÇ
109,"Jul 20, 2022",I already know what's going to happen but somehow I still want to spend coins to keep reading!! It's just so good TT
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Wait so are the Dokkaebi previous constellations or just the enforcers?
109,"Jul 20, 2022",I can't..  his name is Paul..  Paul.. 
109,"Jul 20, 2022",bish imma beat you up with the money you paid me
109,"Jul 20, 2022","It took one-third of the coins he had to become a platinum member. But at the same time, it ONLY took one-third of the coins he had to become a platinum member. The sheer flex of ""I have enough coins to burn on penalties"" should not be this satisfying, but it is."
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Let‚Äôs get ready for a beat down‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶barely"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",I have been waiting for this moment!!!!

109,"Jul 20, 2022","I guess Dokja deciding to beat up that dokkaebi wasn't purely out of his own anger, but also because that little Yuseung had become full of hatred and bloodlust in her desire to kill that Dokkaebi. Him doing this would greatly decrease her anger. It was a good move"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",Someone's gonna wish to die tonight üòè
109,"Jul 20, 2022",This is what I call satisfying. The author made this dokkaebi especially annoying for a reason. So that we could feel the gratification when Dokja beats him to a pulp.

109,"Jul 20, 2022",The amount of Dokja spend on this chapter is nothing compared to how much coins he will have in the future. 
109,"Jul 20, 2022","i love how he dont care about strategy or any plan, he just want to beat him up"
109,"Jul 20, 2022",I'm not sure if Paul was cursing or if he was speaking in the dokkaebi language that Bihyeong was speaking when the first scenario began. Wait... he was cursing in the dokkaebi language!
109,"Jul 20, 2022",I love that the enforcers said ‚ÄúNo way‚Ä¶‚Äù and still allowed the private meeting. I really believe they are placing bets quietly

109,"Jun 15, 2022","Paul had it coming. More than once he could have let things play out, but nope and now he's definitely paying a price for it. Especially since just because you can't kill anyone in there, doesn't mean they will leave with more than 1HP lol"

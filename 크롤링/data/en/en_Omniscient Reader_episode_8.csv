Episode,Date,Review
8,"Aug 19, 2020",This feels so meta. A reader watching a reader reading a story that you are reading right now. Daaaaang.ü§Ø
8,"Aug 19, 2020","Dude‚Äôs got an interesting sense of morality, you can tell this isn‚Äôt normal behavior for him. I wonder if he got more than just the memory of what will happen in the future, like he had his personality tampered with or something."
8,"Aug 19, 2020","The best part about this whole thing is that the chapter is called ‚ÄúThe Beginning of Paywall‚Äù and if you‚Äôre reading this right now, it means the author successfully baited you to pay to read more paywalled chapters üòÇ
Edit: Obviously this was written on August 19 :P I know you got a free coin somewhere so you should pay for the next chapter üòâ "
8,"Aug 19, 2020","when you see 22 comments and it matches with around the constellations and you realize YOU are the one watching and giving coins to fast pass. WE ARE THE CONSTELLATIONS, HOLY SH*+"
8,"Aug 21, 2020",If we're being honest most MCs are hypocrites but that can be what makes them interesting
8,"Aug 20, 2020",When Dokja least expects it that kid will take revenge for his murdered grasshoppers
8,"Aug 19, 2020",Omniscient Reader Viewpoint is a popular Novel In Korea right now. It has licensed into Webtoon. And soon will have a movie adaptation. Btw. I love the translation so far. Reading webtoon with sound effect. indeed add the thrill.

8,"Sep 16, 2020",Sign my petition to keep the little boy alive 
8,"Aug 21, 2020","I had coins that were about to expire, so I spend them on this excellent read, but now I'll have to wait a month"
8,"Aug 19, 2020",As a light novel reader I'm enjoying watching everyone heading down the theory crafting rabbit hole. üòÇ
8,"Aug 19, 2020",Gilyeong is such a precious character UWU. I‚Äôm a novel reader and YALL IN FOR A WILD RIDE. 
8,"Aug 20, 2020",New category on Twitch : Apocalypse.
8,"Aug 21, 2020",God! I wanna see this webtoon become a movie someday. Dang. It's soo gooood
8,"Sep 16, 2020",It‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm the constellation who‚Äôs pissed he killed my favorite character.
8,"Aug 21, 2020",i am liking this. guess i am gonna stick to the end of this comic. this is the genre i like the most
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Hes just critically thinking about things as if he was still a reader not a player. Imteresting.
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Its weird because the sponsors that are watching this whole scenario seem sick to us as the readers but I feel sick too since I am enjoying this story so much and its literally about so many people dying for entertainment and only one person ends up surviving. iunno you guys tell me what you think
8,"Sep 16, 2020","what if we get sucked into the story at the end?? but then again, our world is dying anyways"
8,"Sep 16, 2020",If u were scared about being in the train and things were super crazy and hectic so than why would u think the outside is ok
8,"Aug 20, 2020",dang i spent all of my coins. hoping the constellations would sponsor me lololol
8,"Aug 20, 2020",I love how the perspective is from a place in the story where the story didn‚Äôt originally start in his web novel. That‚Äôs REALLY clever. Love it ~
8,"Sep 16, 2020",YES! WE LOVE A MC WHO AIN'T SOFT‚ù§
8,"Aug 28, 2020",It feels weird reading the webtoon right after the Webnovel but the way the art portrays everything is very rewarding !! I can‚Äôt wait to see the art for the third scenario!!!
8,"Aug 20, 2020",This is like The Hunger Games meets some alien invasion flick.
8,"Aug 19, 2020",Just take all my coins
8,"Sep 16, 2020","""People's lives are important! So it's only right that you save me!""... says the guy who just tried to beat an old women to death."
8,"Sep 16, 2020","I love that the character isn't all white or black, but has some moral ambiguity instead of being a perfect saint. It makes it a lot more interesting to see the choices he makes, because they truly become choices (rather than right vs wrong answers/ behaviours). I wonder if he will be able to properly preserve his humanity and a sense of value of human life (he's the hero so probably, but still). This keeps on getting better... "
8,"Sep 16, 2020",He's gonna grow attached to the kid just wait. 
8,"Sep 16, 2020",I'm still waiting for my appearance.
8,"Sep 16, 2020","Guys as always this webtoon continues to impress me in execution! I have read the light novel so I know what happens but let me tell you that this series is within the best stories to have been ever written and such a legendary of a story being told... Every character, every plot point, every setting, and even abilities becomes so relevant all throughout the series in ways you couldn‚Äôt even imagine.... Don‚Äôt underestimate it at all and continue to read it because this is going to be huge!!!"
8,"Sep 16, 2020","Does anyone feel like theres something off about the kid? He didn't cry or seemed scared at all, and he just starts clinging to the protagonist, just seems suspicious. Or maybe I have trust ishues idk"
8,"Sep 16, 2020","what i love about dokja is his unpredictability, his actions are so surprising to everyone since he's peak big brain energy"
8,"Aug 19, 2020",I guess hypocrites are the ones who get to live in the end of the world huh. 
8,"Sep 17, 2020","I kinda feel uncomfortable with the way they reverse the order of the characters‚Äô names. Well, at least they didn‚Äôt make Dokja into David or something, so I‚Äôm still ok with it."
8,"Sep 16, 2020"," everyone was focused on watching the ichthyosaur, meanwhile our mc: subtlely picks up the late Edgelord's pocket knife and slides it in his pocket.....very smooth bro, very smoooooth...."
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Since there are 550 chapters in the novel and I'm assuming each chapter is made into one episode...one episode a week would take 10 years to finish on webtoonüëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏èthank fock I'm reading the novel 
8,"Sep 16, 2020","(Sense of guilt):- There's blood on my face by killing him...later :- Nevermind... it was on the mirror...
P.s. I'm so hot..!"
8,"Sep 16, 2020","I like the main character in this story because he isn't the stereotypical ""cinnamon roll who protects people and who people want to protect."" He is just a guy trying to survive."
8,"Sep 16, 2020",the real question is who is the writer of TWSA because he/she knew everything from the start OOO this is getting interesting
8,"Sep 16, 2020","i just love how mc acknowledge that he is an hypocrite too, he's actually vwry smart, I've read like 100 eps from the online novel, i like how the story goes "
8,"Sep 16, 2020",The people who stopped reading the story must feel terrible rn
8,"Sep 16, 2020","Ok, the kid is officially my favorite character. Just look at him squeezing Dokja's arm like that. I just wish he survives till the end."
8,"Sep 16, 2020","I love the dokkaebi so much, theres something really amazing about a lunatic furry capable of destroying a planet. I just love how they managed to make it so cute yet so lethal."
8,"Sep 10, 2020",damn are we just constellations paying to read new chapters ( ÔΩ•‡∏±ÔπèÔΩ•‡∏±)
8,"Sep 17, 2020",see this an MC that I can support in this kind of story. he's calm level headed and he's not denying his enjoyment. his personality doesn't seem to have taken a drastic change let alone just adapting to the new world. or letting his true self free. also the dark comment he made towards the constellations yay!!! my guy
8,"Sep 16, 2020",bro so this is officially my number 1 favorite webtoon
8,"Sep 16, 2020","it cracks me up that we got several chapters setting Namwoon up as this super threatening obnoxious ""generic edgelord"" that was gonna dominate the story, and then he just fell over dead"
8,"Aug 21, 2020",I like 4 out of these 5 kinda want money boi to die. but eh
8,"Aug 12, 2021",he really killed his most hated character in his favorite novel damn #readergoals
8,"Sep 20, 2020","The kid hugging Dokja must be so confused right now. I mean, sure, grasshoppers, but his mom!!!"
8,"Sep 16, 2020","nice to see a protagonist who is analytical, which would make sense considering he read through the story. really enjoying the story so far"
8,"Sep 16, 2020","ok can we just talk about the tremendous memory of Dokja? I mean, how many people can remember every single detail of a novel that has over 3000 episodes!?  edit: ok so I forgot that he has a skill that enables him to remember every episode
(I originally commented this cuz I have terrible memory. and you can see thatüòÖ)"
8,"Sep 16, 2020",From now on I'm going to pay extreme attention to low viewed books or web novels... who knows what may happen... 
8,"Sep 16, 2020",... please just let the little boy live 
8,"Sep 16, 2020",GILYOUNG MY SONNNN
8,"Sep 16, 2020",The way the boy is clinging to him omggg 
8,"Sep 16, 2020","After all that, the old lady still died....It was expected but it's still sad. Imagine being slowly beaten to death by everyone around you just because you're the weakest. What a horrible way to go. "
8,"Sep 16, 2020",damn too bad I'm a broke constellation 
8,"Aug 19, 2020","I can't get over how clever this was, I wouldn't have made it this far LOL"
8,"Apr 24, 2021",I just noticed the little boys arms wrapped around the mc. my heart üò≠üò≠üò≠
8,"Feb 27, 2021",aNd MAy tHe ODdS be eVeR in YOur FaVoR
8,"Sep 18, 2020","Not sure if anyone knows this... but fun fact: the author of the webnovel Dokja's been reading is called tls123 which, if you click the keys in Korean on a Korean keyboard, writes ""god123"". 
My guess is that maybe tls123 is, in fact, a god, maybe god number 123, who created the world of Omniscient Reader. "
8,"Sep 17, 2020",Laughing in Light Novel knowledge.
8,"Sep 17, 2020","CAN WE NOT COMPARE EVERY COMIC/NOVEL/MANGA OR JUST ABOUT ANY LITERATURE WITH ""SOLO LEVELING"" ffs it's not the only comic that use the ""system"". Similar to ""isekai"" in anime and manga. ""isekai"" is like a tag or a popular genre. And that applies to ""level up system"" I am sure i've read other novels and comics that came before Solo Leveling. Solo leveling is great and popular, don't get me wrong. But please let's just be open minded and appreciate the story and work :)"
8,"Sep 16, 2020","i, a lower grade constellation, need a  sponsor to pay the fp. üòÇ "
8,"Sep 16, 2020","Somehow seeing KDJ called dokja kim made me want to cry,,, will YJH become joonghyuk yoo? aaaaaaaah"
8,"Sep 16, 2020",So basically it's Intergalactic Hunger games 
8,"May 31, 2021",It's kind of rare for a MC to not simp for the first woman in the story. 
8,"Apr 26, 2021",who's rereading this for the coins?‚úã‚úã
8,"Feb 1, 2021","how is Gilyeong Lee so calm? he's a kid witnessing something horrible right before his eyes, and he's still calm. and anyway, HE'S MY BABY"
8,"Jan 31, 2021", if dokja ends up betraying the kid istg- üî™üî™
8,"Sep 21, 2020","Would like to compliement the author on attention to detail. In East Asia, the number four is often associated with bad luck due to its name in Mandarin sounding closely to death. In episode four is where the bloodshed starts, total of 124 enemies are killed and all the bloodshed takes place in the 3434 train. This can also be seen in webtoons like Weight of the Sky and My deepest secret. Overall, thank you authors for all your excellent hard work! Keep it up! =)"
8,"Sep 17, 2020",I'm so Relived that the little boy survived . Please let him Live on.
8,"Sep 16, 2020","I really took a liking to the kid. I hope he makes it. Also with all this happening, I‚Äôm really curious to see how the main character looks like."
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Dokja: *offers to help little kid* Constellations: *everyone liked that*
8,"Sep 16, 2020",i like anti-heroes~
8,"Sep 16, 2020",This better not happen to us after we‚Äôre done reading this series. 
8,"Sep 16, 2020","Better read your novels, guys. And don't forget to remember every detail üëå"
8,"Sep 16, 2020",that establishing shot of them on the train was epic
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Plot Twist: We‚Äôre the constellations
8,"Sep 16, 2020",How many of you constellations would sponsor a new character you haven‚Äôt heard of before that comes up and kills the main villain.  Let‚Äôs take tower of god for example would you sponsor someone who killed R!? Would you? Hell yea I would. Didn‚Äôt finish his/her name to avoid any spoilers to anyone who hasn‚Äôt read it yet.
8,"Sep 16, 2020","If you like the story, you can also support the author by reading the original novel officially translated on Webnovel!"
8,"Sep 16, 2020",The reader became the character...Well I'll take some notes down right now..
8,"Sep 16, 2020",I‚Äôm thinking that the author of TWSA is the one who made the world like this like he‚Äôs a rogue constellation and he made the story in hopes of preparing people to survive because he didn‚Äôt want this to happen but only Dokja ended up reading it just my head canon tho
8,"Sep 16, 2020",I smell a big bro and little bro relationship coming to life 
8,"May 8, 2021",You just need a lice in your hair to survive
8,"Apr 27, 2021",U know how were reading this ....what if it happens to us ‚úåüèª
8,"Mar 26, 2021","If the kid dies I‚Äôm going to die along with him, he‚Äôs too adorable to dieü•∫üòÖüò≠"
8,"Mar 13, 2021",That kid is my in my favourite character along with the protagonist so far. If he dies...
8,"Feb 26, 2021",the way the kid is holding onto dokjas' arms is freakin cute asdfghkuvkkb. anyway THIS IS HELLA AWESOME 
8,"Sep 19, 2020",I like how the author doesn‚Äôt just make the mc op since he knows what‚Äôs gonna happen.Instead it has him change the plot of his own story with its own consenqurnces
8,"Sep 17, 2020",I'm really loving Dokja. His character is unique from the usual mc in an action or apocalyptic story.
8,"Sep 17, 2020","Bro props to him for even being able to remember the whole story of TWSA!! I would've forgoten all the earlier chapters by the end, especially if there were so many!! ü§£ü§£"
8,"Sep 16, 2020","I know this is stupid but I really hope that Namjoon Kim survives, if he really is dead then it would be a complete waste of a potentially great character and a dope character design "
8,"Sep 16, 2020","Holy cow, does this mean we're next? Oohü§©.. I'll probably die, lol. üòä"
8,"Sep 16, 2020",I love the design of the giant sea serpents
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Plot twist: we‚Äôre the constellations watching them and fast passes are how we sponsor players üëÄ
8,"Sep 16, 2020","so every story is different depend on the MC, only the plot remain, what happen if the constellation find out he has a full copy of the twsa?"
8,"Aug 19, 2020",Spoiler: This webtoon will be big in a year
8,"Jun 19, 2021",Reading this just in case this actually happens.
8,"Apr 28, 2021",What if we read this and someday this becomes real?! Okay I‚Äôm going to continue reading! SUPER INVESTED!
8,"Nov 11, 2020",The kid clinging to our protagonist is so cute üò≠ hxjfjf
8,"Nov 7, 2020",ahh shitt i keep telling myself that this will be my last chapter for tonight but damnnn i cant stopyself from reading another chapter HAHAHAHHA
8,"Oct 20, 2020",am I the only one who found it cute when the child held dokja's arm in the last pannel
8,"Sep 25, 2020",gilyoungie holding onto dokja's hand got me??? kid #1 adopted!
8,"Sep 18, 2020",I swear if that little boy ends up dying later on-
8,"Sep 18, 2020",I don't ship the girl with the male lead but i'm relieved to see she's alive
8,"Sep 18, 2020","To the Author of Omniscient Reader. I salute and commend you. Hope to see your works featured in the main stream media, soon. I'll be your fan! I may not be number 1. But I assure you, I'll support you! Keep up the good work."
8,"Sep 18, 2020",w-what if... WE'RE the constellations? ü§Ø
8,"Sep 17, 2020",Dokja will be so surprised later on how useful having Sanga with him though. I can just feel it. Sanga and that kid Gilyeong are gonna be huge assets if they team up with him.
8,"Sep 17, 2020","Oml, the most interesting character i see right now is the child, i wonder how he will react, will he just give up from the pressure and disasters going on around him or will he actually become a merciless badass recking everything, im interested to see what happens."
8,"Sep 17, 2020",I‚Äôm glad that the kid who had the grasshoppers to begin with survived. 
8,"Sep 16, 2020",auwhh that kid looks so cute clinging on dokja's hand ‡≤•_‡≤•
8,"Sep 16, 2020",I kinda wanted Namwon Kim to live idk why 
8,"Sep 16, 2020",this series is so good it makes me sad that its weekly because my weeks feel so slow
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Also the little boy is adorable ü•∫ü•∫ he must be protected üò§ i need to see cute mushy older brother-younger brother interactions 
8,"Oct 19, 2021","Hunger games vibe. I‚Äôm sure just about everyone has already said this, but yeah that kid reminds me a lot of that child that Katniss made friends with. "
8,"Aug 8, 2021",I really hope the k8d survives if n9t I'm dropping this
8,"Jul 21, 2021",protect the child please üò§
8,"Jun 7, 2021",Now I know why the name is omniscient..just hoping this shit won't get real after I finish the last chapterüòÇü§£
8,"Apr 28, 2021",Hope the child lives
8,"Apr 27, 2021",Ummmm what if what happens in this WEBTOON happens in real life ?
8,"Apr 27, 2021",wait if he said the readers reading his experience will go thru wtv is happening in his world.... üòÄ ok goodbyeü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
8,"Apr 26, 2021","Dojka: That's just coincidence. Coincidence my foot, he cares about her. If he that kind of guy, he would've let everyone literally kill each other, he just trying to protect them."
8,"Mar 11, 2021","So a bunch of psycho YouTubers with godlike powers make people murder each other? Man, I have weird tastes in stories (which is to say I like this so far)."
8,"Feb 24, 2021",dokja kinda harsh abt himself but deep down i want him to be a somewhat father figure to the kid if that is even possible in this sotory LMAOO
8,"Jan 30, 2021",i need a dokkaebi plushie. Anyone know where ot get one
8,"Dec 31, 2020",I‚Äôve only had Gilyeong for a chapter but if anything were to happen to him I‚Äôd kill everyone in this comment section then myself
8,"Nov 12, 2020","this story is so crazy it should be a real anime it would tottaly blow upüíØ, its just so good and coolü§Øjust saying facts‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è"
8,"Nov 5, 2020",Is anyone else getting Hunger Games vibes from the whole sponsor thing?
8,"Oct 17, 2020","The way the kid is hanging onto him üò¢ I know Dokja is just using that as a way to get coins, but PLEASE HELP THE POOR CHILD "
8,"Oct 15, 2020","Whether he calls it hypocrisy or not, whether he does it for his own survival or sponsorships or not, I‚Äôm just glad the kid has someone looking out for him. That‚Äôs what I care about. He could get sponsorships from the bloodthirsty constellations by killing the kid himself, but he acts like he‚Äôs not a hero even though he didn‚Äôt choose that option. "
8,"Sep 24, 2020",guys now im afraid we will finish this sh*t and enter the apocalypse üòÇ
8,"Sep 17, 2020",I just finished reading all 551 chapters and it was worth it

8,"Sep 17, 2020",read the whole web novel by far one of my favourites I've read can't wait to see the whole story in webcomic form 
8,"Sep 17, 2020","I feel like this will be a long journey, and I'll stick with it till the end"
8,"Sep 17, 2020","At least moral wise the MC is good, I‚Äôll take Hypocrisy over psychopathy any day."
8,"Sep 16, 2020",It‚Äôs a whole damn loop... Is someone reading or watching us who are reading right now?? And are they being read and watched too etc. With all these apocalyptic stories going on I can‚Äôt help but wonder which one will befall us. ü§î Welp it‚Äôs best to stay prepared. 
8,"Sep 16, 2020","My baby Dokja is so handsome, don‚Äôt you dare call him ugly üò°"
8,"Sep 16, 2020","so wait he read the comic and it became real, since I'm reading it, will it be real ü§î"
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Are we the constellations? Cause you know we pay for coins just to read more in advance.
8,"Sep 16, 2020",the moral conflict that he's going through is nicely written. It's getting more and more interesting. 
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Sanga: Thanks for saving me...*sorta flirty* Dokja: It won't happen again. CHILLS lol
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Am i the only one getting hunger games vibes
8,"Sep 16, 2020",I feel like we are the constellations. I mean I already disliked the white haired dude and was impressed with dokja teaming up with the kid
8,"Aug 28, 2021",I love the exploration of a main character that isnt perfect and the dip into sociopathy
8,"Jun 13, 2021","‚ÄúI hope you all are enjoying the show, because you will soon be paying the admission fees with your lives‚Äù ....BUT I WAS JUST TRYNA READ SOME WEBTOON-"
8,"Jun 3, 2021",I am so happy the kid survived  and I guess I kinda get that the old lady died i might sound offensive and am sorry but if some people had to die the old lady would of died sooner or later that was kinda her destiny in this webtoon
8,"Apr 27, 2021",SOSOSO IM LISTENING TO VERBATIM BY MOTHER MOTHER AND THERES A PART WHERE THERES LIKE A SHREEK AND THAT HAPPENED RIGHT WHEN I READ THE RICH DOOD GOING ‚ÄòAAH‚Äô AND I WAS SO CONFUSED-
8,"Apr 26, 2021",the ddokaebi is the definition of cute but psycho

8,"Nov 28, 2020",We are reading what Kim Dokja had been reading for TEN years! 
8,"Nov 10, 2020",even in video games tax is included. just why?
8,"Nov 4, 2020",those two constellations were bakugo stans
8,"Oct 18, 2020",so basically its a youtube live for sleep paralysis demons 
8,"Oct 15, 2020",must protect little boy
8,"Oct 10, 2020",Ohhh that scene with him wiping away the blood on his face and realizing it‚Äôs actually on the glass is so symbolic of how all of bloodshed and dirt are not actually on him at all and how he‚Äôs removed and it‚Äôs all superficial for him; like the reader of a novel
8,"Sep 24, 2020","Now remember kids, that book you left for dust because it's long and totally boring? Go read it back. Who knows, you might get isekai'd in that one day"

8,"Nov 10, 2020",even in video games tax is included. just why?
8,"Nov 4, 2020",those two constellations were bakugo stans
8,"Oct 18, 2020",so basically its a youtube live for sleep paralysis demons 
8,"Oct 15, 2020",must protect little boy
8,"Oct 10, 2020",Ohhh that scene with him wiping away the blood on his face and realizing it‚Äôs actually on the glass is so symbolic of how all of bloodshed and dirt are not actually on him at all and how he‚Äôs removed and it‚Äôs all superficial for him; like the reader of a novel
8,"Sep 24, 2020","Now remember kids, that book you left for dust because it's long and totally boring? Go read it back. Who knows, you might get isekai'd in that one day"
8,"Sep 24, 2020",Dokja is now dadja

8,"Sep 17, 2020",That kid and Dokja look like father and son so I hope they develop that relationship to be honest.
8,"Sep 17, 2020","omg I love this. I have a feeling it's gonna be even better than solo leveling, the main character feels so real. He obviously isn't a hero who tries to save everyone and recognises his hipocrisy and owns it for the sake of survival and I find this really interesting "
8,"Sep 17, 2020","""I was only gone for a minute..."" Me when I return to a room of 3-4 years olds"
8,"Sep 17, 2020",I'm not scared at all that in the end of this comic the world will end. nop
8,"Sep 17, 2020","I really recommend you guys read the novel too, it‚Äôs explains a lot of things in depth and is just as good in my opinion"
8,"Sep 17, 2020","THIS IS AWESOME CAN""T WAIT FOR THE NEXT EPISODE Dokja is awesome his character is definitely one I admire"
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Wait if we read this to the end will this happen to us? 
8,"Sep 16, 2020",I swear if this becomes our reality....first thing ima do is probly have a mental breakdown. then constantly make meta jokes.
8,"Sep 16, 2020",It's hard not giving a spoiler when you're a fan of the novel ‡≤•‚Äø‡≤•but I won't cuz I am a human
8,"Sep 16, 2020","7 episodes in and I still pronounce TWSA as ""Twasa"" like Mamamoo's ""Hwasa"" "

8,"Sep 16, 2020",from now on I'm reading every webtoon till the end! never know when it'll come in handy üëÄ
8,"Sep 16, 2020","""total nutcase"""
8,"Oct 18, 2020","AND THE FACT THAT THE EDGE LORD WOULDVE KILLED ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE CABIN BECAUSE HE WANTS TO IS WHY HE NEEDED TO DIE. GOOD RIDDANCE, WE WONT NEED TO SEE HIS UGLY FACE ANYMORE, AND YES IM STILL MAD AT HIM FOR EVERYTHING HE DID AND SAID BEFORE. If I was Dokja I would've smiled and laughed as he begged me to save him and told him ""you wanted to kill people, you said you'd kill the losers. So I'll take your advice and Let. You. Die"" hmüòä"
8,"Apr 25, 2022","ayo ü§® yall saw how dokja said, ""I hope you enjoy the show. Because sooner or later you will all be paying the admission fee with your lives.""

8,"Oct 11, 2021","dokja talks about as if he was the only who read twsa, but there were 1000 other people who read the first chapter? and ~500 who read the first ten.. so there are several other ppl who know about the beginning of this apocalypse. or am i wrong?"
8,"Jul 19, 2021",don't know i'm kinda rooting for that little kid and that girl to live
8,"Jul 1, 2021",this idea is so impressive. it makes me want to read the novel.
8,"Jun 25, 2021",I'm going to read this to survive my apocalypse üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
8,"Jun 16, 2021",It would be crazy as this series ends the same thing happens to us. Just some food for thought.
8,"Jun 1, 2021",THAT KID IS CUTE
8,"May 14, 2021","Hm. If they have to kill a loved one, i wont have to worry because no one loves me so üëç"

8,"Apr 30, 2021",Awww... that little boy Gilyeong Lee was really squeezing Dokja's arm after teaming up. üò£ ¬øHow old is he? He looks like a lost little puppy. 
8,"Apr 30, 2021",Who else is reading the doekkbi‚Äôs voice in Bill‚Äôs voice from Gravity Falls 
8,"Apr 28, 2021",Is anybody sad like me that that white hair boy died? I mean the people who he killed would die anyway...I belive he would be a memorable character If he survived. 
8,"Apr 28, 2021",that child is cute tho
8,"Apr 27, 2021",I swear to god if the last chapter of this ends up being called how to survive the apocalypse 
8,"Apr 27, 2021",Shiet I'm hooked....I'm tensed...it's all over my mind!!
8,"Apr 26, 2021",The hunger games: universe edition. that's what it sort of reminds me of. but this is a great story.
8,"Mar 25, 2021",episode 7: doja claimed gilyeong as his son uwu
8,"Feb 10, 2021",124 KILLS BRO AND IN JUST ONE GRASSHOPPER WHAT WAS THAT BUG ON!!! oh and this is just like unordinary
8,"Jan 4, 2021",I really want the kid to survive....he looks a little younger than me...
8,"Jan 3, 2021","they look like a family, the mom, the dad, the hot grandpa, the teenage son, and the youngest son "
8,"Jan 1, 2021",This is a very interesting mc. I'm impressed by his complicated personality
8,"Dec 27, 2020",i like how the mc isnt some sort of goody two shoes that does everything right. like him being a hypocrite just to survive. he's obly humsn after all 
8,"Dec 13, 2020",He has protagonist energy 
8,"Dec 8, 2020",SWEET HOME WILL FINALLY HAVE ITS SERIES. I REALLY HOPE THAT OMNISCIENT READER WILL HAVE ONE TOO!! I LOOK FORWARD TO IT!

8,"Nov 7, 2020",Hunger Games webtoon.  I like it tho.  
8,"Oct 16, 2020",Dokja has gained a son! it's super efrective!
8,"Oct 16, 2020","I am so glad he wasn't pictured as an hero. While it is true you can't afford to be idealistic in this situation, it is also true that saving the old lady had no point since everybody was going to die anyway. While is not morally corect to kill to survive and it's a big deal he stood up for what should be normal, it would be bothersome to assume that he saved her. I would hate if he would assume that not the life itself was important but the fact that he tried. I really like his perception."
8,"Oct 15, 2020",Thats cool a reader reading a story and now the reader is in the story and we readers are reading his story üòß
8,"Oct 15, 2020",wait is this just a manifestation of webtoons and the whole concept of it
8,"Oct 15, 2020",this comic is one of the best comics who deserve more attention than it has
8,"Sep 26, 2020",Adopt the child!
8,"Sep 25, 2020",I noticed the boy didn‚Äôt even cry or look scared after all the traumatic violence he saw. Its kinda strange...like he has no feelings/empathy?
8,"Sep 25, 2020","That‚Äôs why, kids. Read books. And don‚Äôt do drugs. Books give you knowledge, drugs don‚Äôt. "

8,"Sep 18, 2020",not to be that person but hyeonseong looks like a sad bear i want to protect but would probably protect me instead
8,"Sep 18, 2020","i always wondered about things like this, that what if what we read in novels, especially of fantasy or action horror thriller genre gets real. And reading this webtoon just blows up my mind and I feel so satisfied and heard. Like literally I'm vibing with this novel from the very beginning, because this is all I ALWAYS wanted. just totally my type."

8,"Sep 17, 2020",I love that kid so much already. I want him to survive and be save with him.
8,"Sep 17, 2020",Nobody seems to be asking the real questions here. Who is the author? He must be some kind of god or at least a person who got recognized by gods. Of course I‚Äôm not stupid enough to believe that people already didn‚Äôt question that. The real question here is who are the people in the story? Are the main characters of this story already people or did they come into existence? Is the author still writing the story? Maybe that would explain MC‚Äôs lack of fear and personality change. 
8,"Sep 17, 2020",I feel the main character is morally grey and I'm kinda digging it 
8,"Sep 17, 2020",My friend showed this to me because she's reading ORV which is the novel version of this webtoon and OMG THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER WITH THE ART AHHHHHH
8,"Sep 17, 2020",And may the odds be ever in your favor...

8,"Sep 17, 2020",Dang it I‚Äôm going to get attached to the little boy and he‚Äôs probably gonna end up dying in some sinister cruel way ugh üò© 
8,"Sep 17, 2020","Spoiler Alert!!!! The ""him"" he was referring to is Yoo Jonghyuk, and he is incredibily strong, but guess who's stronger? ;) Leave that to you guys!"
8,"Sep 17, 2020",I'll be pretty pissed if the kid dies right when I get used to the kid being around T-T
8,"Sep 17, 2020",the white demon thingy is so cute but so evil üòà

8,"Sep 16, 2020",The kid is actually fishy i don't know

8,"Aug 25, 2020",Omg so basically whoever finishes the story will be experiencing the book in real life and whatever they do it will change the story and whoever read the new version it would be the tip for the next reader on how to survive and this continues on and on man that‚Äôs just crazy 
8,"Aug 22, 2020","Oof, I ran out of my free coins from events. But this story is so good that I couldn't help it. I never thought I'd come across a story that'd make me actually want to pay money for more coins. Time to wait at least a month üòÇ :,D"

8,"Sep 18, 2020",I wanna know why is kim dokja not even ugly smh
8,"Sep 17, 2020","I wonder what will happens if our world really turns out like that, are those who read the webtoon gonna survive?? Hehe"
8,"Sep 17, 2020",I think it‚Äôs cute how the kid clings to him immediately 
8,"Sep 17, 2020","Ive always visualized gilyeong to be younger n smaller than this webtoon depiction, and that a*shole Han to be a stumpy man in his 40s with beer belly"
8,"Sep 17, 2020",Bro what if we finish this story and then the same thing happens to usüëÄüëÄthat would be hella cool and scary bro
8,"Sep 17, 2020","i‚Äôd be lying if i say i didn‚Äôt want namwoo to survive, he unlocked a power and he adapted insanely quick he accepted the new reality,, sure he was in it to kill but still further into the story he could‚Äôve been a major asset "
8,"Sep 17, 2020","My brain needs more time to process this information. This has to be the most meta thing I‚Äôve read in a long time.

8,"Sep 17, 2020",THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!  I HAVE NEVER READ A WEBTOON THIS COOL!!!!! I'ma go cry in a corner  out of coolness. Sniff... ( ‚ï•œâ‚ï• )
8,"Sep 17, 2020","Ok this is just a theory but what if, Dokja‚Äôs future self wrote the comic as a warning of what will happen knowing that his younger self will read the comic and survive. "
8,"Sep 17, 2020",It would be so cool if at the end of the story it said ‚Äúthe simulation will now begin‚Äù or whatever they said when this story started
8,"Sep 17, 2020","very impressed with the story telling, best I've seen on this platform. can't wait to read more of this and whatever else the come up with"
8,"Sep 17, 2020","More people should be checkin this out, its so coool"
8,"Sep 17, 2020","I hate it when the main characters know everything, but they can't show off that they know everything and have to pretend to be dumb. Maybe just me, I hate it because other characters always accuse them of stuff when they predict something or they act like they're smarter than them. IDK I just love seeing my MC this smart and being able to show people how smart they r. Like if I was smart, I would do that. I understand why he isn't though and I know i'm terrible person for thinking this way."
8,"Sep 17, 2020",i feel like this dude actually cares about the girl and boy... but he doesnt want to admit it
8,"Sep 17, 2020","And then he goes and tells the constellations to ‚Äúenjoy the show because you‚Äôll soon be paying with your lives‚Äù... it‚Äôs confirmed, we‚Äôre all gonna die in an apocalypse when this ends"

8,"Sep 17, 2020",Getting Hunger Games vibes
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Wait if you look at the prologue dojka is fighting himself do you think the protagonist looks just like him Edit: sorry the question I was trying to get across was so you think the author made the protagonist dojka since he is the only one reading the book.
8,"Sep 16, 2020","Honestly... like really Honestly, I did not think that Sanga would survive. ü§≠"
8,"Sep 16, 2020",The fact that we are reading this. Doesn't that make us the sponsors.ü§îü§î
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Wait so are we the constellations?!
8,"Sep 16, 2020",wait so the constellations already know what will happen in the scenarios? cus the pop ups said the weird situation meant it would take longer to process. if they already know they why would they watch the furry beings channel? kinda like someone reading a summery one a movie they b havent watched b4
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Time to stack up on coins for this webtoon. 
8,"Sep 16, 2020",moral: Read apocalyptic stories so you know the future :)  PS Love the comic
8,"Sep 16, 2020","But if he's changing things, the more he changes it and the further things progress the more it will diverge from the original story he read and the less he'll be able to guess what comes next right?"
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Is this 2020 in another universe lol
8,"Sep 16, 2020",This story is very exciting ü§Øü§Øü§©ü§© but it is so hard to wait for the next episode üò≠üò≠but I will wait patiently because this story is worth the wait üòçüòçThank you Author ‚ù§Ô∏èüíó
8,"Sep 16, 2020","isn't Namwoon's death supposed to affect the way things go? He was an important character in the novel, right?"
8,"Sep 16, 2020",I'm really impressed about the quality of this Webtoon. Just take my coins baby
8,"Sep 16, 2020","I should remember every detail of this comic, when it ends I‚Äôm sure I will be reading it on a train and then the end of the world starts. Maybe I‚Äôm being read right now"
8,"Sep 16, 2020","I am purely uncomfortable from how they got the names wrong. 500 coins is actually quite little honestly if you‚Äôve read to nearly the 400th chapter. Bihyung is so cute üòå

Edit: Nevermind, I‚Äôve read to a chapter where they explained that those were the real names"
8,"Sep 16, 2020","hm, i kinda wanted namwoon kim to survive. wonder how it wouldve turned out, if he couldve ever changed. a high school kid is needed in this mixed-age group. and idk if its good or bad that he was a psychotic sadist..."
8,"Sep 16, 2020",sigh i love this webtoon
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Dokja was pure SAVAGE in the last few episodes
8,"Sep 16, 2020","More than anything, I am curious about who was writing and posting LN MC was reading? "
8,"Sep 16, 2020",little boy is so CUTE anyone agrees with me
8,"Sep 16, 2020",I love how calm he is despite having a totally different mental state. at this point his accepted where he is and is strategically thinking through everything.
8,"Sep 16, 2020","this comic is getting better every episode,love this"
8,"Sep 16, 2020",like the webtoon not the comment
8,"Sep 16, 2020",What if this Webtoon story is finished and became real? 
8,"Sep 16, 2020","this is kind of creepy in some way, cuz i am reading this story, and what if in the future, this story becomes my real story? do u get it? ü§£"
8,"Sep 16, 2020","Woah dokja's character is great. I mean he is calm even now, and thinks of his survival like that. "
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Will there be a change in the story? because he kinda killed a character that wasn't suppose to die in the first scenario.
8,"Sep 16, 2020","also remeber when it said there were still a few people who were reading the comic when it first started but our mc was the only one who finished, will we see any if those people who started it and wikk they even remember..idk jus a thought"
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Does this mean that when this Webtoon ends... the ones that are reading it will then be sucked into this plot just like he did? ü§îüò´
8,"Sep 16, 2020","Damn... When we actually know why he's okay with it all, it's actually so sad üò≠... "
8,"Sep 16, 2020",it's all fun and games until this all happens to us in 8 years 
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Waiitt..... we havee to read it for 8 years..woahh

8,"Sep 16, 2020","dude I love that combo already, the boi is cute and dojka is hot.üòÇ"
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Just telling you people that you can read it online up to chapter 19
8,"Sep 16, 2020","Idk if I should spend my coins on this since it‚Äôs awesome and I already know what‚Äôs going to happen so waiting to get caught back up after a few weeks won‚Äôt be too bad, or this other series that just had a huge cliffhanger..."
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Can a constellation sponsor me coins?
8,"Sep 16, 2020",I literally downloaded webnovel last night because of this WEBTOON. So good!!!

8,"Sep 16, 2020","I've know the child for two pages and I would kill every last being, monsters included, for him"
8,"Sep 16, 2020",I swear this comic is gonna be giving 2020 ideas and we are gonna end up like dokja( I think that‚Äôs his name) 
8,"Sep 16, 2020",I‚Äôm happy the kid survived 
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Am I the only one who laughed during Namwoon's death..? No? Okay....
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Gilyoung is my cinnamon rolllllll
8,"Sep 16, 2020",it'd be very scary if what we read turns into reality
8,"Sep 16, 2020",May the odds be ever in your favor... oh wait
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Everyone gangsta till the white fluff actually smiles
8,"Sep 16, 2020",The fact that the rules suddenly change with how the bug eggs' values were halved is such BS

8,"Sep 16, 2020","Great chapter! But, I can't be the only one disappointed that Kim Namwoon died right? Kim Dokja is a pretty interesting protagonist though."
8,"Sep 16, 2020",This new story has SOO MUCH POTENTIAL  no matter what happens from here on i want to see tgis ending becuase it could be the greatess
8,"Sep 16, 2020",I‚Äôm glad the kids alive

8,"Sep 13, 2020",This is the first time I've used coins(*ahem* free coins) and there are over 200 comments!!
8,"Sep 12, 2020","Take notes. We‚Äôre watching a reader live a story, we‚Äôre next. "
8,"Sep 11, 2020",Why does Gilyoung look like a really short 18 y/o instead of the 11 y/o he's supposed to be? Dokja also looks like he's just barely past 20...
8,"Sep 9, 2020",Dokja: Sees ant hill- ‚Äúima do what‚Äôs called a pro gamer move‚Äù

8,"Jul 25, 2022","Nah but, can we talk bout little detail, of how he mistaken the blood on the window for the blood on his face, as a normal person would do. It adds realism as goofy as it is."

8,"Aug 28, 2021",The boy survived so its all okay. Also do i see bucket loads of therapy in their future?
8,"Aug 26, 2021",imagine if this webtoon come true and we'te the only one who survived ‡≤•‚Äø‡≤•
8,"Aug 6, 2021","Wait a damn minute....Aren't we the one who is reading this right now-
 ( ‚Ä¢·∑Ñ‚åì‚Ä¢·∑Ö ) "
8,"Aug 4, 2021","I'm just going to say,.... the Dokkaebi looks pretty cute sometimes"
8,"Aug 2, 2021",We must protecc the child 
8,"Jul 25, 2021",phew! good to know that sangah and the kid survived.
8,"Jul 18, 2021",the villian animal thing is so cute idk why üòÇ
8,"Jul 14, 2021","""Alright then which constellation is my sponsor-""
""RAID SHADOW LEGENDS"""
8,"Jul 14, 2021",wait...coins...are the constellations a parallel for webtoon readers?
8,"Jul 5, 2021",already finished reading the novel and seeing dokja wiping the supposedly blood on his cheek got me-
8,"Jun 30, 2021",i hope that after we finish this story it won't happen in real life üò≥ that would be awkward üò¨
8,"Jun 17, 2021",this reminds me of tomb rider king(mask) and solo leveling
8,"Jun 15, 2021","to him we are the constellations ,well it can't be helped can it be üòàüòà"
8,"Jun 6, 2021",Gosh.. this is so freaking exciting üòµ..  experiencing it in reality is really a huge thing!!! 
8,"Jun 6, 2021","Meh, seems like Dokja is not my type. I love ML that always protect other even though he's weak like Sung Jin Woo. "
8,"May 27, 2021",i‚Äôm glad the girl survived üò≠üò≠üò≠ rip everyone else tho üòü
8,"May 27, 2021",Wha- the kid survived!?! Thats surprising 
8,"May 25, 2021",rEmaIn cAlM 
8,"May 14, 2021",What was the kid doing all by himself!? I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs fudgin traumatized jeez üò≠
8,"May 13, 2021",Is it just me or the way the reader tampers the scenarios would result to changes on the next happenings in the future?
8,"May 2, 2021","I'm now addicted to this Webtoon :) also being honest, if that kid with the bugs weren't there well let's say it wouldnt go so well ü•≤"
8,"May 1, 2021",If solo leveling and the hunger games were combined:
8,"May 1, 2021","I‚Äôm usually not into fantasy webtoons but this one is so addicting, its really interesting."
8,"Apr 30, 2021","Strange that he doesn't care a bit about the girl, I would have tried to save her. But in this situation better care about yourself I guess"
8,"Apr 30, 2021","I feel like Main character, dokja (finally a Korean name easy enough to remember lol) will become the villain, the antagonist of the hero/protagonist of the novel of 3000 chapters. "
8,"Apr 30, 2021",Wait what the f*ck the MC seems cold and strategic. He‚Äôs no longer interested in the brown haired lady and he doesn‚Äôt seem to actually care for the little boy. This is different from the first episode! 
8,"Apr 30, 2021",So we're all constellations then? What would happen if we really could sponsor the characters?
8,"Apr 29, 2021",Maybe I am a Constellation
8,"Apr 28, 2021","üíÄüíÄ ""it wont happen again"" you practically saved her why are you saying this lmfaooo"
8,"Apr 28, 2021",The main guy is very interesting...he isn‚Äôt a really good person lol
8,"Apr 27, 2021",this needs to be an anime
8,"Apr 27, 2021",Imagine if someone had some hand sanitizer! Unlimited coins!
8,"Apr 27, 2021",Danganrompa who? I only know omniscient reader. 
8,"Apr 27, 2021",I wonder if coca cola will sponsor them lol
8,"Apr 27, 2021","They have sponsorships sorta like the hunger games. This story is like an extreme jumanji, and hunger games, with a bit of danganraonpra. It‚Äôs very interesting and the main character is very clever! Glad webtoon is doing this coin reading challenge to bring my attention to this webtoon."
8,"Apr 27, 2021","bitch the game is retcon-ing itselfwhat do you mean the award was halved, i get an award, it has been halved, i get another award... MAKE UP YOUR MIND, THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE PREPROGRAMMED "
8,"Apr 26, 2021","When ‚Äúhe said now they are the ones watching me‚Äù, I got the chills. I suddenly remembered that he‚Äôs talking about us."
8,"Apr 26, 2021","SUPER bastardisation arc! I wonder will he have any morals, or is he totally detached? Does he care at ALL about that poor young fella, or is he just a means to an end..."
8,"Apr 26, 2021",the little kid hugging him was adorable I really hope he makes it and their relationship grows 
8,"Apr 26, 2021",This feels like hunger games in a whole new level. Interesting 
8,"Apr 26, 2021",the lieutenant's kinda hot doe--
8,"Apr 26, 2021","Glasses dude is underestimated, so he‚Äôs probably gonna live for a long time tbh"
8,"Apr 26, 2021","Wow I have no words, imagine the person who wrote this story. Genius! "
8,"Apr 22, 2021","Okay but...if we‚Äôre reading this, does that mean that a dokkaebi will appear on the train WE‚ÄôRE riding on the day that this webtoon ends??"
8,"Apr 21, 2021",giving me hunger games vibes. i like itüòÇ‚ú®üëè

8,"Feb 17, 2021",Phew... the lady was safe. But bruh MC why you gotta be too cold on her? [Some Constellations are starting to doubt the MCs attitude. MC will be observed further in the future.] 
8,"Feb 15, 2021",it's amazing I'm in 8th grade too is this what going to happen in future üò±

8,"Jan 16, 2021",wait that means I am a constellation!!!! 
8,"Dec 17, 2020",This Webtoon is making feel the hype as much as Solo Leveling did
8,"Dec 12, 2020",At least he showed that he is HYPOCRITE not some a** MC who also r hypocrites but never accept that and blame the villains or kill them because he is a MC. 
8,"Dec 10, 2020","Im so happy he stayed with the kid, hope the doesn't die, if he does dont tell me ok"
8,"Dec 6, 2020",It was creepy when he said 'livestream' I mean it's just creepyüòê It is like a youtube channel with only 21 views each scenario/video. Pft. I don't know if anyone gets my point
8,"Dec 3, 2020","Why is helping another classified as ""hypocrisy""?"
8,"Nov 27, 2020","OH GOD, IF THAT WAS ME, I WOULD FORGOT LITERALLY EVERYTHING, GODDAMIT I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE CHARACTERS' NAMES"
8,"Nov 25, 2020",I'm well damn impressed with the art! and there's only a few type of art quality that can impress me üôÉüôÉüôÉ

8,"Oct 17, 2020",so he just threatened us readers to enjoy his show until it's our own turn.....I'd like my 4th wall back please and thank you üò±
8,"Oct 17, 2020",frick we're the constellations of the constellations 
8,"Oct 17, 2020",I SPONSER THE CHILD!!!!! LET THE CHILD LIVE!!!!!!!!!!
8,"Oct 17, 2020",He looks so calm lmao
8,"Oct 16, 2020",This is awesome ü•∫..!author Love you(‚ô•œâ‚ô• ) ~‚ô™
8,"Oct 16, 2020",This feels like a dude living through a visual novel which turns out to be an RPG kinda thing and I'm living through that RPG
8,"Oct 16, 2020","I really enjoy the fact that each episode is long I mean, I don't mind short, but a longer episode makes me actually feel like I'm ready a book or watching an episode of it."
8,"Oct 16, 2020",if the kid dies ima throw a fit. let him become evil or grow up and hate MC but he's adorable. please don't kill him
8,"Oct 16, 2020",i kinda feel like this storys gonna end with him undoing everything and everything will go back to normal or sumthinn
8,"Oct 16, 2020",as we go people are likeing chapters less and less and its scary. someone made a meta comment on how this story made them found but this just makes me think of a wheel and that we are the next spoke  in this wheel watching to one ahead of us breaking 
8,"Oct 16, 2020",Why is this so addicting!?
8,"Oct 16, 2020",awesome i like how that little  boy is close to MC
8,"Oct 15, 2020",it's like watching the rajj show
8,"Oct 15, 2020",Ok that kid is my fav so far so PLEASE PROTECT HIM
8,"Oct 15, 2020",Sooo...if there are about 3000 episodes in the novel he was reading..then will there be 3000 episodes in this webtoon..? Cause this first scenario happened in only the first episode..soo is there..??
8,"Oct 15, 2020","Why did I have to ""discover"" this magnificent webtoon when it has so few chapters :C"
8,"Oct 15, 2020",i just cant take the dokkaebi seriously it's too cute  
8,"Oct 15, 2020",I really want the little boy to survive he seems so precious 
8,"Oct 15, 2020","Woahhh the episodes are super long!! Tysm author(s)!!! Also, when he said ""hypocrisy"" and said to the kid ""lets team up"", i have a feeling that i wont like he'll do but i mean we never know i love this webtoon and dokja too hes amazing i love his personnality, ty! ^^"
8,"Oct 15, 2020","""you'll end up paying the admission fee with your lives"" that phrase give me shivers"
8,"Oct 14, 2020",I usually got bored reading the first 10 chapters but this webtoon got me all hyped from the very beginning. This is insane!!!
8,"Oct 14, 2020","So you're telling me that aside from only 5 people surviving and that Dokja just replaced Namwoon, the Milky Way is a friggin LIVESTREAMER? And that the constellations are giving emoji donations every episode?! WTF"
8,"Oct 14, 2020",woow the script and the art is mind-blowing ü§Ø  I just can't hold my fingers from swiping up for the next episode üò±ü§Ø the story is a bit confusing at the start but very interesting üò¨ü§ê author please keep writing / drawing we need more of this webtoon its amazing ü§Øü•∫
8,"Oct 14, 2020",omg the little boy survived!! It's been like idk half an hour i commented on the other chapter worrying about that kid
8,"Oct 14, 2020",That kid is a little too quiet ü§î
8,"Oct 10, 2020",Paywall = pay for all chapters ASAP 
8,"Oct 7, 2020",I'm afraid after reading the final chapter of this manhua it will become a reality.... Nope! I will break the cycle. 
8,"Oct 7, 2020",wait why do i fell like something like this gonna happen to me too as i am also reading this ( maybe to all of us )
8,"Oct 4, 2020",Sponsoring people to watch them kill each other..... Anyone else thought of Hunger Games? 
8,"Oct 1, 2020",so like hunger games. just in an intergalactic level. with demonic hamsters.
8,"Oct 1, 2020",please don't let anything happen to gilyeong ü•∫
8,"Sep 30, 2020",If anything happens to that child I‚Äôm going on a killing spree
8,"Sep 29, 2020",I‚Äôm rooting for the kid. I bet he‚Äôs like a secret genius or something lol. Surely Dokja offered to team up with him because he has some kind of value.
8,"Sep 27, 2020",I'm just glad the kid survived.
8,"Sep 27, 2020",Yaaaay he‚Äôs got a lil bunny to protect now yaay !! I hope the kid stays safe and they both become like brothers to each other and that the kid doesn‚Äôt turn out to be Evil and actually betray him because of he killed his bugs or the kind actually hates humans and wants people to die !!!! I really hope !!! Also please stay safe author !!‚ú®üå∏‚ú®üíïü•≥üéâüíõ
8,"Sep 26, 2020",I‚Äôm so glad the kid lived I hope he has a long and good life (as good as it can be I guess)
8,"Sep 25, 2020",Love the complexity of the MC... he‚Äôs more of an anti-hero that is looking out for himself. He wants to be the hero of his world. He doesn‚Äôt care if the others around him survive or not. Everything he does is for his own gain. Its like he has a God complex...he has the key to beating the system. 
8,"Sep 25, 2020",The dokaebi is so adorable though.Too bad its evil
8,"Sep 25, 2020",Anyone else getting Monokuma vibes from the dokkaebi
8,"Sep 25, 2020","Since he let the edge lord die, doesn‚Äôt this mean that the story will be changed and not go exactly how he read it? "
8,"Sep 24, 2020","I wonder if TWSA is an actual book/story out there, I'd love to read it! I'm soo hooked to this story, it's so interesting and unique!! "
8,"Sep 23, 2020",bruhhhh the plot üíÄüíÄ this is called a masterpiece üíÄ
8,"Sep 23, 2020","that system seems so salty. yeah you killed 124 organisms, but they weren't resisting so we only gonna reward you half credit "
8,"Sep 23, 2020",I'm really enjoying this story.. but I'm also low-key reading this just in case.... ü§≠
8,"Sep 23, 2020",I love how the fluffy guy Is looking down on dokja but dokja probably knows his deepest darkest secrets and all his weaknessesüòÇ
8,"Sep 23, 2020",Bro THIS BOUTA BE A GOOD SERIES
8,"Sep 22, 2020","is it just me, but I really don't want Sanga to die"
8,"Sep 22, 2020",I‚Äôm throwing hands if the kids dies no cap
8,"Sep 22, 2020",Glad to see the novels being adapted so. Well!!
8,"Sep 21, 2020","It feels like if I complete this manhwa, it would happen to our world as well"
8,"Sep 20, 2020","What does Dokja mean when he say his action is not sympathy but hypocrisy as he needs to survive? Did he team up with the kid with the intention of sacrificing him as a scapegoat later? Damn, I really hope my speculation is wrong though as I won't want our protagonist to become a scheming cheater. Also too afraid to read the Webnovel even after learning about its existence as I don't want to spoil myself of the story >_<"
8,"Sep 20, 2020",i love these webtoons man ughh this deserves all the love
8,"Sep 20, 2020",Gilyeong!! You are my favorite character. 
8,"Sep 19, 2020",GOD i just finished the novel & now im reading the webtoon. I CAN'T WAIT FOR JOONGHYUK'S DEBUT üò≥üò≥

8,"Sep 18, 2020",rat bastard is surfacing hahahaha
8,"Sep 18, 2020",Ichthyosaur was not a snake but it was a water inhabiting reptile
8,"Sep 18, 2020",Ok now it is getting interesting
8,"Sep 18, 2020",b-b-bute he's just a kid!! plzz don't abandon him üôèüèªüôèüèª
8,"Sep 18, 2020","I feel like he‚Äôs forgetting about the people who read the first few chapters of the story. Didn‚Äôt he say that he was the only reader for most of the episodes, but that a couple of people read the first few? So it‚Äôs possible there‚Äôs more people out there who recognize what‚Äôs going on"
8,"Sep 18, 2020",one of best fantasy-type webtoon i've ever read ‚ù§
8,"Sep 18, 2020",this is probably gonna happen to us too lol
8,"Sep 18, 2020",GOSH the inception of it all! I am in loooove with this series. The art. The plot. The characters. Everything is A1!

8,"Sep 17, 2020",üé∂The world turned upside downüé∂ Good luck survivors! I'm warning my heart not to get too attached to any characters too soon because this looks like a bloodbath fiestaüíï
8,"Sep 17, 2020",I need more
8,"Sep 17, 2020",the sponsorships & stuff reminds me of the hunger games
8,"Sep 17, 2020","Hey, wait....why does Dokja think he's the only one who knows how the story ends; what about the author?? he wrote the story right?!?? Right??!"
8,"Sep 17, 2020",can't wait for kim dokja to invest in more stats he bout to be more thiccer im looking forward to more of his nice looking ass and also the appearance of his companion!!
8,"Sep 17, 2020",Kim Dokja has adopted son Lee Gilyeong :)

8,"Sep 16, 2020",I am sooo tempted to read the light novel. The only thing stopping me is my lazy ass and fear of committment
8,"Sep 16, 2020",the dokkabi or whatever the fluff its called.. I want it. 
8,"Sep 16, 2020",He is waaay too calm though...

8,"Sep 16, 2020","Ofc I have already read this story ways before buuuut daaaamn did not expect it would be possible to make a webtoon for this, it‚Äôs difficult considering all the details of the story esp. for the next following chaptersüòâ Great job!!! Would not even complain for anything üòÖ"

8,"May 8, 2022",its mighty interesting how Dokja decides to team up with every single person who us important in TWSA exceot for Namwoon whom he decides to kill. Makes you wonder what his goal was at the beginning.

I'm so glad Namwoon died. I was worried the granny would die beforehand and let him live..An edgelord who acted tough ready to slaughter everyone til he realized he wasn't the top dog. Dokja is the reader being able to insert himself and kill that character we despised so much and I love it.

8,"May 1, 2021",maybe i am a constellation.... 
8,"Apr 30, 2021",is nobody going to talk about the fact that dokja is gorgeous as hell üò©
8,"Apr 30, 2021",Yas the little boy survived yayyy
8,"Apr 30, 2021",This is really starting to remind me of The Hunger Games with the sponsors and all... lol

8,"Apr 29, 2021",it reminded me of hunger games till now ...beautiful art btw and story seems great
8,"Apr 29, 2021",Guess it pays to be an egghead loll
8,"Apr 29, 2021",I just wanted to ask if he said that there were 3 insects when he threw the box and then he killed one more so how come there were 3 more survivors excluding the kid and himself?Does it mean someone killed a person?üôÑüôÑ
8,"Apr 28, 2021",Its funny for me to think that the very reason i'm currently re-reading this is because i want to calculate the total amount of coins Dokja have ü§îü§îüòëüòëüòëüòëüò∂
8,"Apr 28, 2021",wonder what will happen on the last chapter of this series...
8,"Apr 28, 2021",reading this novel all over again in 2021 feels so nostalgic 
8,"Apr 28, 2021",this is like somebody playing a game that they played before but doesnt want to miss the dialogue
8,"Apr 27, 2021",Gilyeong Lee looks like Shaoran Lee from sakura card captors 
8,"Apr 27, 2021",dam already changing stuff
8,"Apr 27, 2021",hoooold on. is no one else freaking out? doesn't this mean that we are all constellations????
8,"Apr 27, 2021",We're the constellations here y'aaalll!
8,"Apr 27, 2021","what if dokja, who finished reading ""three ways to survive a apocalypse"" shows us what happens in his world and what if this webtoon comes to an end and were reading the last chapter and it all comes trueü§®"
8,"Apr 26, 2021",godddd this deserves to be a movie also it seems a lot like train to busan
8,"Apr 26, 2021",That little paws snapping though....so cute

8,"Apr 26, 2021",It reminds me of the Hunger Games.
8,"Apr 22, 2021",hunger games? ü§£üòÖ
8,"Apr 21, 2021",The fact that Dokja knows how this story could turn out to be while he himself is experiencing that story is fascinating to me & the fact that we‚Äôre reading that
8,"Apr 19, 2021",I'm upset that he died he'd have been such an interesting character
8,"Apr 17, 2021",But how did the rich old dude and the military dude survive?
8,"Apr 15, 2021","I don't understand why I find him so adorable even if in real life he would definitely consider me to be a butterfly compared to him, so easy to kill and afraid of literally everything that can be considered an insect."

8,"Sep 16, 2020",The story keeps getting better and better I have nothing more left to say
8,"Sep 16, 2020",I wonder if all these newcomers realize they'll be reading this for 2 years easy. 
8,"Sep 16, 2020",This reminds me of solo leveling. üòÇ
8,"Sep 16, 2020","""some constellations are impressed by your good ded and rewerdid you"", me: nice"

8,"Sep 16, 2020",is he going to lose some of his emotions later on in the story
8,"Sep 16, 2020",I cannot be the only one think that one of the constalations is the write of the story and is sponsoring him. 
8,"Sep 16, 2020","Aww~ I love how the little boy is squeezing the Mc's arm. So cute!  Anyway, if humanity somehow finds a way to beat this whole situation I would be a whole new level of pissed, like no the only thing that should happen is that they decide to leave because THEY want to not because humans chased them away. I'm sorry but that would be dumb "
8,"Sep 16, 2020",the art is so gorgeous as expected from the same studio as solo leveling
8,"Sep 16, 2020",damn that cliffhanger hurt harder then my dad walking out on us

8,"Sep 16, 2020",They did such a great job adapting this!!!
8,"Sep 16, 2020",There was an Amazon ad at the end so I legit thought that there was an Amazon ad on their screens lol

8,"Sep 16, 2020",Biyung is still a fluff ball in my mind.
8,"Sep 16, 2020","The novel/manhwa is by far my most favorite series, the novel is breathtaking, I recommend the novel if you want to read faster"
8,"Sep 16, 2020",After the last panel there was a Victoria secret ad. I thought that was one of the sponsors üòÇüòÇ
8,"Sep 16, 2020","If we read this, does that mean when it‚Äôs over, we will be in the same situation?"
8,"Sep 16, 2020",I'm hereeee! Idk but I think Dokja is so cool. And I'm so into this now
8,"Sep 16, 2020","I‚Äôm surprised that the edge lord guy died. Not only did a ‚Äúvillain‚Äù of TWSA wanted to team up with our protagonist, but he died in the very beginning of the novel. This is such an interesting concept to me."
8,"Sep 16, 2020",I'm really loving this plot line
8,"Sep 16, 2020",so we're part of the constellation?? how to gift coins?

8,"Sep 10, 2020",I‚Äôm just glad Sanga is alive lol
8,"Sep 9, 2020","Dokabi thinks humans are insects ,Author thinks humans are banks"
8,"Sep 9, 2020","I get a solo leveling vibe everytime I read, I don't want to compare it too much but they're both really good and I can't wait to read more!"
8,"Sep 6, 2020","I'm honestly surprised no one else survived by killing someone else during the chaos when no one else was looking. Everyone had high hopes they'd be the one to find a bug. A wonder if a mosquito or fly that wandered into the train would have also counted? And if he knew and wanted edgelord not to make it through, he could have gotten someone else to kill him to get an extra survivor, although he would have been perceived as evil"
8,"Sep 3, 2020",the deokkaebi is kind of cute!
8,"Sep 3, 2020",I wonder why the dokkaebis doesn't know that he is the one who knows the story. who is the author?
8,"Sep 2, 2020",i had coins to fastpass. man i want more. just release all of it at once pls. i bet there will be some ppl in the real world that read the first few chapters that also realize that this is the webtoon. lets see who will be the antagonist or something like that. i also wanna meet the protagonist. i feel like he gets hyped up everytime he gets mentioned in some way. what i question myself: will there be any problems because that one guy died?   and aswell it was said that there were only2suevivors
8,"Aug 31, 2020",DAMNIT ü§¶üèΩI like this series TOO MUCH üò≠
8,"Aug 30, 2020",This Manhua's setting is great as hell. It might even make it to be one of the top 10 Manhuas in all history in the future.
8,"Aug 28, 2020","Dokja, sanga, and the little boy all killed bugs... but who did the military guy and mr. Han kill to survive?"
8,"Aug 28, 2020",Don‚Äôt forget to like guys!
8,"Aug 27, 2020","Such an interresting story !I still don't know how I will feel on the long run with a main character being a sociopath (like in Dexter or in Death Note). Usually in those kind of plots there are other more human characters, which gives us a little air. Will see :-) very interresting though ! "
8,"Aug 27, 2020",TIL that our world is just a freemium mobile game üòì
8,"Aug 27, 2020","He said it himself, he‚Äôs a hypocrite üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ this is üî• "
8,"Aug 26, 2020",Oh no now I‚Äôm brokeeee üò¢
8,"Aug 26, 2020",Kind of interesting that he is giving the lady the cold shoulder but wanting to team up with the kid. I wonder if the kid has some hidden talent or sponsor we don't know about just yet
8,"Aug 25, 2020",This is such a crazy story line but I love it!
8,"Aug 22, 2020",Weirdly reminds me of all the reasons I fell in love with the original SAO. Art style is pure impact.
8,"Aug 20, 2020",The little boy is sooo cute I‚Äôm gonna protect him :( 
8,"Aug 20, 2020","ah, galactic hunger games with an anime twist! "
8,"Aug 19, 2020","When demon dude notices one of his players has already skipped a tutorial.  Seems a little suspect, js, could hide those cheats a little better!"
8,"Aug 19, 2020","Anyone else getting solo leveling vibes? Just me? Oh, ok üôÉ"
8,"Aug 19, 2020","For some reason I can tell I‚Äôm going to be invested in that child, and if something happens to him I‚Äôm going to riot!! I can feel this webtoon emotionally draining me eventually üòÇ"
8,"Aug 19, 2020",So this is basically the hunger games
8,"Aug 19, 2020",the art in this webtoon is unparalleled omg
8,"Mar 18, 2022","if you're looking for a webtoon where the mc doesn't care who he kills.. and doesn't simp for some lady he met at his job, ""The earths chosen survivor"" is just for you. üòÉ"
8,"Aug 24, 2021",I don't blame Dokja for his actions. He understands what type of world he'll end up in and how problematic a sociopath like Namwoon would be to his survival. He did what he had to to maximize his chances of surviving. He shifted cold blooded real quick. It's a new world out there
8,"Jul 22, 2021","Finally, a protagonist who isn't a mortal saint. Don't bash me lads, I'm new to webtoons. All my life I've been mainly watching anime. Mainly Shonen Jump so you can see why this is a breath of fresh air for me."
8,"Oct 16, 2020",is the timeline not affected...? like the butterfly effect. the original said two would live but five actually made it through. not to mention one of the og survivors ended up dying too. this is v questionable...
8,"Sep 17, 2020",sanga go with dokja .dokja even adopted a kid.u can get married XD.and Dokja know the story .its a good deal.üòâüòâ
8,"Sep 16, 2020",i love that little kid üòº
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Watch at the end of the series it was all a Dream .... bhahah
8,"Sep 16, 2020",Huh I now get the Omniscient part of the title
8,20 hours ago,I swear if the kid dies üò≠
8,2 days ago,The art is giving me goosebumps!
8,6 days ago,I am alone in a room filled with a lot of bugs. I'll be an S class when this happens to us.
8,"Oct 6, 2022","Okay so theory time!!! My theory is that it was one of the Constellations who had written TWSA Another theory: The little boy didn't kill the grasshopper, rather a person close to him (probably his mother) to survive. I think so cuz he still had his palms balled up after the scenario ended. Don't ask me why this thought came to me. I just feel like the little boy isn't as innocent as one might expect "
8,"Oct 3, 2022",The art has and will always be amazing
8,"Oct 2, 2022",I'm just so glad the white haired edgelord is dead already! he was annoying.
8,"Sep 26, 2022",Why did a poker add come up after that last panel‚Äî I‚Äî 
8,"Sep 21, 2022",I am just glad the kid survived

8,"Aug 16, 2022",Dokja's too hard on himself.
8,"Aug 16, 2022",I'm glad Dokja saved Gilyeong. 
8,"Aug 14, 2022",I  was literally listening to elden ring main theme soundtrack throughout this episode and the beggining was just too epic
8,"Aug 6, 2022",It feels like if I finish reading it will come true lmoa
8,"Aug 5, 2022",and the mc said the readers  aka  constellation of this story will pay for their lives why do i feel threatened :< i know this is late bc this manhwa came August 2020

oh nvm she caught one"
8,"Jul 5, 2022",i don't like it when there's a kid involved in this kind of story üò£üò£ 
8,"Jul 5, 2022",What if at the end of the story he wakes up back on the train and is like ‚Äòthat was a weird dream‚Äô. That would explain the changed behavior too and why he‚Äôs not showing the basic human emotion of why-the-crap-is this-happening lol
8,"Jul 4, 2022",So he got turned into a sociopath huh
8,"Jul 2, 2022",Why can't they just kill that stpd brown haired lady? she's a btch who's making trouble 
8,"Jul 1, 2022",Dokja and Gilyeong teaming up? A yes for that!

8,"Jun 7, 2022","I'll be darn amazed by the writer and artist for this story, Plus re-reading this over again gave me a lot of excitement!"
8,"Jun 4, 2022",Now this feels like Marble Account manga.
8,"Jun 2, 2022",isn't it little unfair like dokja knows the entire plot from begining to last and the rest of the cabin crew are clueless lol
8,"Jun 1, 2022","I have a feeling that Gilyeong will be one of the most dangerous characters in this series, I haven‚Äôt read it yet but yeah‚Ä¶"
8,"May 29, 2022",This is kinda like squid games meets solo leveling

8,"May 23, 2022",awwww the furry Lil thing is so cuuuute
8,"May 21, 2022",a reader is reading the story of a reader who is reading something else

8,"May 19, 2022","Some of you might hate him. Just saying but a few minutes ago he was a reader and now all of this he just doesn't feel like it's a real world he feels that this is just a novel and he had to survive, he doesn't have any attachment to anyone because for him they are either side or supporting character he doesn't feel it's real like you know. Don't hate him too much because he later wants to save the world and everyone and also see others as human ,as a real world not just novel or he is a reader."
8,"May 17, 2022",I feel bad for the old lady :( 
8,"May 16, 2022",So‚Ä¶. Who killed the old lady? 
8,"May 13, 2022",I just realized that the edge lords and the mc's last names are the same

8,"Mar 21, 2022",big brain
8,"Mar 17, 2022",I doubt he could have saved everyone because if he tried then the Edgelord guy would have killed him and gone on to kill the rest.
8,"Mar 17, 2022","Wait, shouldn't it say 2 grasshoppers and 123 grasshoppers for 125 total? He crushed one right before throwing the rest in the container, and then crushed the one with the eggs right, or did he actually just crush the head the first time and then crushed the spot with the eggs the 2nd time on the same one."
8,"Mar 13, 2022",Damn that‚Äôs messed up he could‚Äôve chosen to save everyone but he didn‚Äôt

8,"Sep 23, 2020","Ooh I guessed correctly about the constellations being sponsors. Honestly, this is so freaking cool. I wonder how dokja will keep navigating. Obviously, if he goes against what he knows what's written in the story, then eventually, things he won't know about are bound to happen. Also, what if the constellations or the dokkaebi end up doing something to him because he keeps interfering with the scenarios?? "
8,"Sep 23, 2020",f in the chat for the grasshopper eggs tho
8,"Sep 23, 2020",I really enjoy how he steps up under the pressure instead of breaking down

8,"Sep 20, 2020",the dokkaebi seems to be a mix of the cheshire cat and hades. hades since they‚Äôre kind of making a deal and sticking to it. the cheshire cat since they seem kind of like the villain or just not a good person but they‚Äôre also helping the survivors in i way i think
8,"Sep 20, 2020",ooohhh dokkaebi bihyung

8,"Sep 16, 2020",Sooo...this  is kind of like a POV story where we are the readers reading a a comic about a person life who is stuck in a novel which he has read and now the constellations are the one who is viewing the reader's story. So to put it in simple words reader's (MC) story (which he has read)  is being viewed by another reader and we are in a third person point of view perspective who knows everything about their universe.
8,"Sep 16, 2020",'It wont happen again' - nice one Slick. Must be a hit with the ladiesüòë.

I'm surprised the the other guy from the company survived too. I had a feeling the others were going to still be there. Namjoon got what he deserved. If he didn't adapt so quickly to the new world, maybe he would have survived too"
8,"Sep 16, 2020","How come the woman, Sanga, is still alive? Did she kill any living organism? Edit: Yes, I did read it carefully. I just commented before I got the answer. I didn‚Äôt know I was going to get the answer in the same chapter...ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

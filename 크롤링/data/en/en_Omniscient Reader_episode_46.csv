46,"Mar 17, 2021","Capture the flag, extreme edition."
46,"Mar 17, 2021",They really thought they could finesse Dokja Ha you fools he will never fall for such cheap tricks 
46,"Mar 17, 2021","I just want to thank the creator, because this is one of the rare action webtoons which prominently feature both male and female characters without oversexualizing the women. It‚Äôs sad how grateful I am to see women depicted with proportional bodies and real clothes, without a bunch of male-gazy upskirt shots during every fight scene, with well rounded personalities outside of being eye candy, etc. Thank you."
46,"Mar 17, 2021","lol Huiwon reading the scenario ""Yikes, it's long."""
46,"Mar 17, 2021","Sangah : ""We might survive without anyone getting killed!! ü•∫""....... Huiwon a few minutes later : ""Did the constellations just say that you are evil? üó°‚ò∫Ô∏è"" "
46,"Mar 17, 2021",That dramatic walk though.
46,"Mar 17, 2021",Anyone else ready for Junghyeok Yu to wake up and (hopefully) begin listening to Dokja?
46,"Mar 17, 2021",Me and the boys playing capture the flag in class during elementary school üòÇ
46,"Mar 17, 2021","Meanwhile, Junghyeok naps."

46,"Mar 17, 2021","Sleepy-C's art is crazy good! That one panel of the 4 of them about to attack? Amazing üëèüèº It looked like it could be a slow-mo shot of an action/superhero movie with the lens flare on the sword. Also uh not important, but the lady in the black top from Dongdaemun is really pretty ü§≠ & Ilhun is good looking too!?"
46,"Mar 17, 2021",Pildu is about to earn his paycheck again with that OP defense ability. 
46,"May 5, 2021","Dokja in a nutshell: ‚Äúyou may have outsmarted me, but I‚Äôve outsmarted your outsmarting‚Äù"

46,"May 5, 2021",cant scam a scammer

46,"Mar 17, 2021",never take what a gossiper says at face value
46,"Mar 17, 2021","Dokja : "" I play giant mantis  face down and one man army face up , both in defense mode"" . "
46,"Apr 28, 2021",hello fellow broke people
46,"Apr 27, 2021",Aand I already used the free coins.
46,"Apr 28, 2021",Only went through the 20 chapters for the free coins. Continued to binge the next 44 chapters for the amazing story. Immediately spent said coins on the next chapter ü§£
46,"Mar 17, 2021",Someone must not realize the kind of story they are in
46,"Mar 21, 2021","Been watching  the series for awhile now, I never comment on webcomics this is my first one. Just wanted to say I love the story and hope you get a bunch of traction "
46,"May 5, 2021",this is a dokja's eyelashes appreciation comment
46,"May 5, 2021","Yoo Sangah appreciation here! I feel like people tend to underrate her. I would consider Huiwon my favourite female character in ORV (along with someone who should be appearing soon) but Sangah is so cool as well, especially with her thread this episode. Also, that panel of the four of them walking forward ready to fight was screen-shot worthy."
46,"May 5, 2021",i love how these scenarios are basically just children's games on crack.
46,"May 5, 2021","sangha""we won't need to kill today ""after a few panels  heewon "" wow ,I got some evil people I have to use my skill ""ü§£,I love how dokja and heewon always have the same reactions to things ,and also dokja was like so nervous when heewon was staring at him ,am I the only one who loves heewon more cause she brings fun in the grp "
46,"May 6, 2021",after all of this is over Dokja will have to adopt that kid
46,"Mar 17, 2021","‚ÄúWe might not have to kill anyone!‚Äù Oh you poor innocent soul, how did you survive this long?"
46,"Mar 17, 2021",Gilyeong best boy
46,"May 5, 2021","‚ÄúHis attribute did not blossom thanks to meeting the wrong supporting constellation, but he is still useful to be used as a pawn‚Äù is a pretty solid dating app bio. "
46,"May 5, 2021","I think they were expecting Yu to be the Leader of the station. That was why he was take aback by Dokja being the leader. Then when he mentioned someone famous for being dangerous (I think), the guy was surprised and pretended he didn't know him. That's when they knew they were lying. He said their world's equivalent to who is Beyonc√©."
46,"Mar 17, 2021",These comments are very dry I expect more from the enlightened beings that are this far into the fast pass 
46,"May 5, 2021",I just have a single question... One thing I do not understand... Why... Why do they all look so good
46,"May 5, 2021","Not gonna lie,the home team looked badass walking into battle üò≥"
46,"May 5, 2021",Love that shot of Pildu complaining but still allowing GY to sleep on him üíô character development is so nice 
46,"Mar 17, 2021",next week I need it so bad 
46,"May 5, 2021",OMG THAT PANEL- BI PANIC
46,"Apr 30, 2021","theory time? what if the ""secretive plotter""  is the same person who wrote the novel?Dokja didn't recognize him at the begining , so what if he's there to oversee? and maybe he chose dokja to save Junghyeok"
46,"May 5, 2021","Awww momma Dokjaü§ß he's like a worried mom leaving his two sons in the house for some grocery shopping Xd Their team tho,, they're so COOL!!!!!!!"
46,"May 5, 2021","I can't believe I read every episode in 2 - 3 minutes while the author, artist, and studio probably take days to create this....this is why I always read it at least three times üò≠"
46,"May 7, 2021",SHEEEESHHH THAT WALKING PANELLLLL
46,"Mar 17, 2021",Ha! I knew those guys felt off. Luckily you cant trick Dokja so easily. 
46,"May 5, 2021","Sangah: ""We might not have to kill anyone!"" Anyone: üíÄ"
46,"Mar 17, 2021",Ah... the good old foreshadowing from the ‚ÄúWe might not have to kill anyone‚Äù
46,"May 6, 2021",mann dokja is so fine
46,"May 5, 2021",man. look at dokja's thigh gap. MAN.
46,"May 5, 2021","other stations attacks chungmuro*
dokja:so you have chosen DEATH"
46,"Mar 17, 2021",i love this webtoon. 
46,"May 8, 2021","For those theorising about why Ilhun reacted that way when Dokja said his name, it was implied in this chapter when Dokja asked Ilhun if he was expecting the leader to be Jonghyuk. Ilhun reacted that way because he thought Jonghyuk would be the leader."
46,"May 5, 2021",I hope this gets animated one day. Not live action as it probably would have some restrictions but animated
46,"May 5, 2021","violence is not the answer its it's a question and the answer is yes sun tzu, art of war"
46,"May 5, 2021",why do these random disposable characters look hotter than the main squad? you want me to feel bad for canon fodder??
46,"Mar 17, 2021",you can't BS a BSer boys. oldest trick in the book. 
46,"Mar 17, 2021","""well be done once we plant the flag."" I think you mean if you plant the flag."

46,"May 5, 2021","Look all I‚Äôm saying is if anyone touches Gilyeong, they really gonna catch these hands üò§‚úãüèæ"
46,"May 5, 2021",violence is never the answer but it always a option 
46,"May 5, 2021",Sangah is spider woman of ORV
46,"May 5, 2021",Okay but Dokja and Ilhun riding together on the same bike looks good not trying to imply anything else lolüò≥üòÖ

46,"May 7, 2021",the way sangah used her skill was so pretty ...???? gosh I love this webtoon so much

46,"May 5, 2021","""yikes... it's long"" - was exactly what my last two brain cells said when I saw the scenario! "
46,"Mar 17, 2021",The rules dont state that you can't move the flagpole. Sounds like a loophole ready to be abused
46,"May 18, 2021",Woooooo sangah is becoming so goodCharacters that fight with strings are so awesomeee
46,"May 7, 2021",[The Late Reader finally caught up to the plot]
46,"May 7, 2021",Pildu is going to be useful for flag protecting

46,"May 13, 2021","lmao, how any competitive kid thought capture the flag was likeüòÇ"

46,"May 5, 2021",Keep on making Sangah more badass please
46,"May 5, 2021","Well, when I played capture the flag, people didn't... like you know... die-"
46,"May 5, 2021",I really hope Junghyeok Yu wakes up and starts kicking assüòÇüòÇüòÇ
46,"May 5, 2021","Violence in this comic is like the Spanish Inquisition, nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition, much like violence here!"
46,"Mar 21, 2021",does anyone else think that the secretive plotter is the one who wrote the novel?
46,"Mar 17, 2021",*me mid-way thru the chapter* oh this feels very sus. *me at the end of the chapter - is still shook anyway*
46,"Jul 16, 2021","""yikes it's long "" whenever I open my copy to learn answers af"

46,"May 8, 2021","Sangah really comin thru! YES girl, I love it!!"
46,"May 8, 2021","Theory time: I just thought about this but what if Dokja is the author of TWSA? Let me explain. What if Dokja is stuck in this sort of loop and every time he‚Äôs close to the end of the cycle, he writes his experiences in hopes that himself in the next loop will finally break the cycle. Just like Junghyeok Yu is still in a live die repeat cycle, Dokja might just be in one too. Idk this idea just came to me and I wanted to see what y‚Äôall thought."
46,"May 6, 2021",Guidon being like the second to Dokja makes me happy please don‚Äôt kill her anytime soon author I like this judge lady killer
46,"May 6, 2021",i hope gilyeong is okay

46,"Apr 29, 2021",I recomend you people to pay attention to very little detail of the conversations and texts from this chapter on. It might be helpful to understand future chapter better.

46,"May 5, 2021",This Capture the Flag: Super Edition is looking super interesting just like I was hoping. I'm very curious to see what'll happen when Junghyeok Yu wakes up...
46,"May 5, 2021",Hmm... that surprise at hearing Dokja's name... is it that he was expecting someone different? Or could he actually know something about Dokja himself?
46,"May 5, 2021",Ummm how do you gift Dokja coins....and how do you do it if you‚Äôre broke üòê

46,"May 5, 2021","Am I the only one who thinks the two groups of four looked like parallels to each other? the four who came on the bikes are like the evil versions of our mcs. idk they just strangely looked like them to me üòÇ except the guy who was talking, he looks nothing like dokja. maybe Jungheok's parallel (they have almost the same hairstyle just different colors), seeing as he was supposed to be there"

few panels many people are dead lol"
46,"May 1, 2021","okay. side note, and PURE CONJECTURE, but I believe that the ""secretive plotter"" is actually the author of TWSA. 
the author's initials on the story were ""TSP"". Plus, following the logic of how Dokja identified the constellations (an author holds the plots for their stories in secret) as well as the fact that Dokja never read about ""secretive plotter"", leads me to believe that the author of TWSA is Secretive Plotter in disguise."
46,"May 1, 2021",I'm actually very curious about what happened to Ilhun and his gang/Group..
46,"May 1, 2021","I just want them to beat the bad guys, junghyoek walk down like nothing happened, and dokja hit him and scold him like an angry mother... I guess he that's what he is"

46,"May 6, 2021","Gee, I've never had top comment! "
46,"May 7, 2021","SPOILER about Dokjas looks: so apparently they see dokja as ugly and there is something that makes his facial features look blurry so he doesnt look pretty/handsome like we see him and he was even known as the ugly oneüòî that reminded me of when people say ""I swear he looks much better in real life"" *shows pic of someone* ""yeah...no""ü§£ HELP I SWEAR OUR BOY LOOKS BEAUTIFUL "
46,"Apr 29, 2021","Soo, I'm curious. Huiwon was supposed to grab an item from the cinema for Sangah like Dokja grabbed an item for Hyeonseong. Where is it? We haven't seen or heard about it, nor do we even know what it is or if she actually grabbed it. Will she receive it later, did it slip Huiwon's mind? It kinda seems like bad writing to me. "

Episode,Date,Review
42,"Feb 17, 2021", Kim Dokja: Why do I hear boss music?
42,"Feb 17, 2021","while I appreciate our translator, the fact that I don't know what amount of fast pass money goes to the webtoon, author and the translator, really rubs me the wrong way. I want to keep supporting the series but if author gets nothing of it then.... But the translations are great 👌 keep up the good work my man. Edit: I tried to research the subject before but everything I found was just baseless rumors since nobody could confirm anything. Thank you for you input it was insightful."
42,"Feb 17, 2021",I am extremely glad the girls in this series are given screentime in fight scenes and are shown to be capable combatants. Pretty excited to see them all kick ass!
42,"Feb 17, 2021","Haha I just love the dynamic between Dokja & Joonghyuk 😂 The head smack must've felt so satisfying after hours of stress worrying about the sunfish. Also, I can't wait for this fight. I'm pretty sure it's the 1st time we see YJH actually fight"
42,"Feb 17, 2021",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' was speechless with the turn of events and is telling the incarnation KDJ that ghost fleet is copyrighted.] [The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' also wanted to hit the incarnation YJH in the head too.] [5 coins have been sponsored.]
42,"Feb 17, 2021",I know is a web novel but i just wanna say: this webtoon never disappoints. Week after week is always interesting and the art is magnificent.
42,"Feb 17, 2021","Dokja plays the game he has to, but I still feel like he genuinely cares about these people. Something that he’ll probably consider a bad thing once it’s too late to stop."
42,"Feb 17, 2021","Dokja: *Head smack*Junghyeok: ""...And I took that personally."""
42,"Feb 17, 2021","Dokja's new stigma should be translated as ""Song of the Sword"" as it is the official and most famous English title for the bestseller by Kim Hoon, which is about Admiral Yi Sunsin. Also, Yi Sunsin is the more recognized name of the general, even though Lee and Yi are the same Korean word, and the Wiki also uses Yi Sunsin for his name too, so I hope you can fix this for more historical accuracy (just like how people write Samsung instead of Samseong, despite the latter being more correct)"
42,"Feb 17, 2021",i’m more worried for when junghyeuk yu finds out dokja hit him
42,"Feb 17, 2021","Huiwon is total wife material. Look at the way she IMMEDIATELY sprung into action to help our boy Dokja. Zero hesitation, not a care for the dangers. Just all action as soon as she saw Dokja take that heavy blow. "
42,"Feb 17, 2021",The way dokja smack jonghyuk head 🤣
42,"Feb 17, 2021","""Did a put him into a state of shock?"" Dokja i think you overestimated yourself a little here buddy "
42,"Feb 20, 2021","I really wish the translator would change the Stigma ""Sword Song"" to ""Song of the Sword"" , because it is based on a real book published in Korea. I wish they don't change much of the name, because there is a lot of historical reference."
42,"Apr 7, 2021",Lmao ok but the way his first reaction to seeing junghyeok is walking up to him and bonking him over the head
42,"Feb 17, 2021","[A Reader from our timeline wishes Kim Dokja a belated happy birthday] btw, his b-day was on Feb 15..."
42,"Feb 17, 2021",I dont wanna play a game of battleship against her
42,"Apr 7, 2021",Love how Dokja always complains about other people's OP abilities when he's literally the Omniscient Reader 😂
42,"Feb 17, 2021",Damn my mans hands are rated E for everyone.
42,"Feb 17, 2021",It was an OK ending... I guess... 👀 “I guess”??? That girl literally just destroyed themmmmm
42,"Apr 7, 2021","I'm glad that the characters at least have some role to play instead of being hostages and motivation to the mc. Like teamwork is good u know, u not sopposed to solo all the time"
42,"Feb 17, 2021",Junghyeok: “These hands are equality made. Allow me to demonstrate.”
42,"Apr 7, 2021","Ah yes, the moment when you walk upstairs and see your ally get yeeted against a wall and your teacher attempt to commit murder?"
42,"Feb 17, 2021",this is one of the best comics i've ever read I can't wait to see what happens next
42,"Feb 17, 2021",so much foreshadowing coming up and amazing panels... stay tuned. 🐟🦑 supremacy
42,"Feb 17, 2021",Equal rights equal fights 💀
42,"Feb 17, 2021",Webtoons: How many coins would you like to use for this? Me: Yes
42,"Apr 7, 2021",theres no CHARACTER who can beat him but someone who isnt a character from the story might be able to im expecting Gilyong will probably beat him somehow i mean he seems like he will be very strong in the future 
42,"Apr 7, 2021",People: Writing their comments like they were constellations. Me: *laughs in novel*
42,"Apr 7, 2021","dokja, my guy. whether or not junghyeok is under control i really can't see a situation where you don't get punched after that stunt you pulled"
42,"Apr 7, 2021","the way Dokja smiles when approaching him, ""Finally free smash in the head🤚☺️"""
42,"Feb 19, 2021","I love Omniscient Reader, both the webtoon and webnovel, and I will keep reading no matter what but is it possible for the translations to be more refined? Reading the novel's translations and then going to here, it's a bit disappointing to see certain terms translated incorrectly or not exact. Plus it would be great if the Korean honorifics could be added to the story (and you can put what it means as a small description on the side). It would be more interesting to have everything correctly :)"
42,"Apr 7, 2021","Anyone else here read the Webnovel and got annoyed when they called the stigma ""Sword Song"" instead of ""Song of the Sword?"" I've found that, since reading the webnovel, I've gotten kinda annoyed by all of the misspelled names and such 🤔🤔🤔"
42,"Apr 7, 2021","Dokja's survival guide: step 1: Casually approach Junghyeok, step 2: Smack him in the head for being an edgy piece of shit, step 3: Die"
42,"Apr 9, 2021","Everyone in ORV: ""Dokja is ugly. I'd die for him but he is sooo ugly!"" Me, looking at the official illustrations and manwha: 👁️👄👁️"
42,"Apr 7, 2021",i love how gilyeong's way to compliment people is to give a thumbs up and make a short statement
42,"Apr 7, 2021",“Overpowered much?” Says the truly overpowered guy 😂 
42,"Feb 19, 2021",Dokja don't abuse your husband even if it's funny 💀
42,"Apr 7, 2021",i feel bad for jihye though she’s getting attacked by someone she really respects 
42,"Apr 8, 2021",pls i WHEEZED when Dokja smacked Junghyeok LMAOO if they were to be in a normal story setting i think they'll be bestfriends 
42,"Apr 8, 2021","Dokja really went ""AYE I LIKE YA CUT G"" on Junghyeok hahaha"
42,"Apr 7, 2021",dokja could be a model with that walk cause dayumm
42,"Apr 7, 2021",here is the bromance I live for💜💜
42,"Apr 8, 2021","URIEL TEAM ANYONE? (If you know, you know)"
42,"Apr 8, 2021","In the beginning, the author of TWSA said they've won in a contest. Is it a contest to choose what will happen to the world? And since the author won, their story gets to turn into reality. "
42,"Feb 17, 2021",HAHAAHA KDJ FINALLY HIT YJH
42,"Apr 7, 2021","Honestly tho in terms of strength and skill, Junghyeok is unrivaled "
42,"Apr 7, 2021",The way Dokja smacked Junghyeok had me rolling on the floor and I still am😂😂
42,"Feb 18, 2021",It felt so good to see  Dokja finally hit Junghyeok 😂🙌🤜
42,"Apr 7, 2021","Gilyeong, this would be a good time to use Mjolnir..."
42,"Apr 9, 2021",[Swords Song] huh? let's just pray they won't change [Way of the Wind] to [Wind Way]
42,"Feb 17, 2021",I thought the Cinema Master was called Simulacrum in the webnovel? 
42,"Apr 8, 2021","Huiwon best girl. She protecc, she atacc, but most importantly she's got Dokja's back. ✨"
42,"Apr 7, 2021","What if Junghyeok knew who Dokja was, and knew about his abilities? What if Dokja and Junghyeok were good friends in Junghyeok’s first regression? Just saying, considering this is his third regression, what if Junghyeok is treating Dokja that way because of something we don’t know of?"
42,"Feb 17, 2021",HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY KIM DOKJA-NIM! 🥳
42,"Apr 12, 2021",I was happy when I started this webtoon cuz I ‎saw there were 40+ episodes for me to read so no cliffhanger by the time I read them all but then I read all of them in less than 2 days 😭 now I’m sleep deprived and sad
42,"Apr 8, 2021",This webtoon has increased the bar SO high at least for me. I cant even enjoy other content I used to because now I always compare 😭
42,"Apr 8, 2021",lol dokja hit junghyuk's head but his hand is in pain instead of junghyuk's head 🤣
42,"Apr 8, 2021","Okay, but I just love the story/ back stories in this series. Like, there is some serious character development here, and the plot in general is so well written. If you pay attention, you can pick out little snippets of evidence that Dokja is starting to really care for his ""group members"". Not to mention the art, which I really appreciate and enjoy looking at!"
42,"Mar 22, 2021",The way that they illustrated these scenes so beautifully 
42,"Feb 17, 2021",why is Junghyeok such a bae 😭
42,"Feb 17, 2021",oh well i think we have a problem 
42,"Apr 7, 2021","[Constelation Lover of rules demands to read the names with the pronouns such as ""Dokja-ssi"", ""Huiwon noona"" , ""HYUNG""]"
42,"May 6, 2021",Petition to have more scenes with Dokja catching Joonghyeok off-guard and smacking him from behind <(￣︶￣)>✧◝(⁰▿⁰)◜✧(人*´∀｀)｡*ﾟ+.
42,"Apr 30, 2021",i keep staring at the art even after I've read the part coz the at is sooo good and the artist must've spent so much effort in it [5 coins have been sponsored]
42,"Apr 12, 2021","jihye’s face and her saying “master?” hurt me a little bit, i guess someone she trusted trying to hurt her must be saddening "
42,"Apr 8, 2021",I'm a 39 year old mom and I still think this is the BEST webtoon comic.
42,"Apr 7, 2021","To be honest, Kim Dokja doesn’t really care about Yoo Jonghyuk dying with the reason being this world line ending, he just really doesn’t want Jonghyuk, the person who he idolizes, wants to become, the person whose story he followed for more than a decade, and the protagonist that, actually, saved his life, to die."
42,"Feb 17, 2021",my man's under genjutsu
42,"Apr 7, 2021",You already know something was up when Junghyeok didn’t immediately try to kill Dokja after getting smacked by him 😂
42,"Apr 7, 2021",gotta love how fucked everyone is
42,"Apr 7, 2021",Basically summarizes Dokja’s friendship with Junghyeok tbh 
42,"Apr 7, 2021",i love how the cover picture for this chapter is of dokja getting beat up
42,"Feb 17, 2021",That escalated nearly as quickly as I read this chapter 😆😆

42,"Apr 7, 2021",gilyeong my smol baby throw your hammer of thor at him!! lolol
42,"May 5, 2021",that brisk power walk over to him was absolutely hilarious.
42,"May 3, 2021","""Did I put him in a state of shock?"" 😂😂😂😂 OML"
42,"May 1, 2021",Junghyeok said these hands are rated e for everyone 
42,"Apr 12, 2021",anyone gonna tell Dokja how hot his bod is😘
42,"Apr 12, 2021","I don't know about y'all, but the fact that each and every chapter of this webtoon doesn't have 99,999+ likes (like it should) sometimes makes me think that likes will keep dropping and then very few of us will still be reading till the end and the apocalypse will come with the last chapter and this is the guide to survive it. "
42,"Apr 8, 2021",I love the thumbnail.10/10
42,"Apr 8, 2021","Rest assured, Yoo Joonghyuk believes in beating you regardless of your age, race, gender, or religion 😌"

42,"Apr 8, 2021",thumbnail is me whenever i see the update notification
42,"Apr 8, 2021",Dokja walking up to Junghyeok: *casually approach the child*
42,"Apr 7, 2021",...Ijust researched.. people ship Dokja and Junghyeok- I'm questioning HOW- and WHY
42,"Apr 7, 2021",Dokja finally got his slap~
42,"Apr 7, 2021",The way Dokja walked up and smacked Junghyuk 😂😂 
42,"Apr 7, 2021",I love the reaction when Dokja recieved his reward it's like receiving the best item in the game when theres a small percentage of obtaining it and I know everyone is upset that the translation didnt go well but yall have to understand you ain't going to get the full translation of something all the time it's like watching a anime where it's like wait that left this out but we know what they mean 
42,"Apr 12, 2021","dear people who write kim Dokja as ""kim dojka"". dojka means breast in slowenisch. please stop writing his name as woman's breast. thanks"
42,"Apr 8, 2021",Holy sht. I'll never get tired to say this but this has to be my most favourites webtoon ever. 
42,"Apr 8, 2021",Y’all don’t understand how much I love this story.
42,"Apr 8, 2021","Ayo hold up. Did a sound effect just say ""CRINGE"". Why is nobody talking about this."
42,"Apr 7, 2021",...okay- so I heard there was a novel about this I didn't know just found out now..and I wnnt to read it..anyone knows where??
42,"Apr 7, 2021",Dammit now i wanna smack someone in the head that looks so satisfying :0
42,"Apr 28, 2021",Dokja's little happy face when he got that sword skill tho. It's moments like these that remind me he's just a huge fanboy. 
42,"Apr 27, 2021",Damn that smack must have been soooo satisfying
42,"Apr 16, 2021",love the way he shines after smacking yjh  at the back of his head ✨ and there you are mister librarian

42,"Feb 17, 2021","This is what happens if you force the original story to speed up,  lvl 24 webtoon protagonist vs lvl 64 real protagonist "
42,"Jul 18, 2021",Dokja: *smacks Junghyeok* Junghyeok: “So you have chosen death?”
42,"Apr 30, 2021",Good for dokja he could finnaly punch him 🤣 it has been so many episodes since the first time he said he wanted to slap him in the face hahahah
42,"Apr 14, 2021",i just finished reading the novel and holy shit. holy shit oh my god i’m fucking crying. this shit broke me into a thousand pieces 
42,"Apr 13, 2021",I hope one day this webtoon becomes an anime. That would be the greatest!
42,"Apr 12, 2021",not a fujoshi but for some reason when dokja said all these things to him it sounded romantic by somehow
42,"Apr 12, 2021",How I love the interaction between junghyeok and dokja 😂
42,"Apr 7, 2021",Imagine Dokja slapped him so hard it kills him 🤣
42,"Apr 7, 2021",Dokja activated the Cain Instinct– B O N K ✨
42,"Apr 7, 2021",the first thing that Dokja did when he met Junghyeok is to smack his head lol
42,"Feb 18, 2021",you giys it's an anime reference chill they are joking they dont actualy  think that punching a women is gender equality.
42,"Feb 17, 2021",This Webtoon is just soooo good. 
42,"Feb 17, 2021",Skill must be good if even Dokja is hyped 
42,"Nov 8, 2021",The god of naval warfare is honestly really wholesome. He decided to sponsor Jihye because she is his friend's descendant...It's very sweet ❤

42,"Apr 9, 2021","""damn this cliffhanger,"" exclaims the reader who already read the entire novel but still feels anxious about the next chapter."
42,"Apr 9, 2021","did... did Dokja really say ""gasp""?"
42,"Apr 8, 2021",that ain't your master no more honey
42,"Apr 8, 2021",this webtoon is so awesome
42,"Apr 8, 2021","Me when I saw this: Ikr? Some girls in my class say they can hit boys but boys can't hit girls. So self righteous. Me reading replies: Oh, so that's not the point?..."
42,"Apr 8, 2021","ohno, now I need to wait a week. maybe I shouldn't have read all 41 episodes in 1 day..."
42,"Apr 8, 2021",NOOOOOOO Dokja go save your boyfriend (if it's possible)
42,"Apr 7, 2021","It's a good thing for Dokja that YJH was under mind control. If he had been himself, he would have killed Dokja on the spot for that slap, no questions asked. Instant kill for the insolence ! With YJH under mind control, at least he has a fraction of a chance to get out of it alive? ^^ (if he manages to overpower him) "
42,"Apr 7, 2021",He really said I like ya cut g

42,"Apr 7, 2021",Webtoon got it right with this chapter tumbnail lol
42,"Apr 7, 2021",This webtoon drives me crazy because it’s too damn good. Makes sense it’s being turned into movies. Quality content. 
42,"Apr 7, 2021",The art in this is so good. I spent a good minute just admiring the details of Jihye’s sword hilt in the sunlight. 
42,"Apr 7, 2021",Dokja’s expressions in this chapter were so funny lmao
42,"Apr 7, 2021",Imagine if Dokja just died after getting hit 💀
42,"Apr 7, 2021",The art! The art is so beautiful 😭
42,"Feb 17, 2021",on webtoons you get paid for every single chapter you publish they eventually become free for people but the fast pass is mostly to help the translators and the webtoon itself The company has to monetize a certain way and they have to get money so that way they can pay the author for every single chapter so technically you give all that money to webtoon and then they give a certain amount that depends on the author and what they and their manager or publisher agree on with webtoon. 
42,"Feb 17, 2021",Dokja: i finally hit u when you were not expecting it :D ~yayy~~ Junghyeok: 👁_👁
42,"Feb 17, 2021",Next episode should have the power of friendship where Junghyeok remembers his days with Jihye 😂😂🤣
42,"Apr 7, 2021",Why do I feel like our kid (Gilyoung) will turn things around ... or is it just my optimism !!

42,"Apr 28, 2021",when you having a moment on your own(●__●) and then your friend sneak behind you .without you knowing it.and suddenly hit you in the head and says (snap out of it ¯(°_o)/¯) and you like ( YOU BIT*H) so i understand your feeling jungheok😂 that dokja's bastrd😂
42,"Apr 14, 2021",Dokja and company versus monopoly man- never saw that coming...
42,"Apr 13, 2021",To think that ghost fleet was only level 1 and completely decimated the enemy line... I love that girls are shown to be extremely powerful and not useless damsels in distress
42,"Apr 12, 2021","please I keep on reading Kim dokja as ""dojo cat"" I hate this edit:LMFAO I JUST CALLED HIM B00BS IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE"
42,"Apr 11, 2021","For those wondering about the novel, trust me it’s an easy read. Bare minimum details/descriptions on anything(not even what each character’s physical appearance or clothes are, just names). It kinda reads like the speaking parts of a screen play. What is written in the panels is almost word for word what is stated in the novel"
42,"Apr 8, 2021",dokja should put critical damage when slapping junghyeok's head🤭🤣
42,"Apr 7, 2021",the prologue scene is coming soon!!👀
42,"Apr 7, 2021",it was such a joy to see the arts after reading the novel. like what you imagine is being drawn in front of you

42,"Apr 7, 2021",Lmao I don’t remember the name of the kid but I will die for him. He literally was like thumbs up for the effort 😂🖐
42,"Apr 7, 2021",Ah here’s our homicidal sunfish
42,"Apr 7, 2021","For those who haven’t read the novel, the reason YJH was vulnerable to the dungeon master (in both the real world and in his 8th regression in TWSA that KDJ mentions) is that he neglected his mental defenses in favor of physical stat boosts. The problem with this is that the dungeon master’s attack is mental manipulation/mind control so YJH is defenseless"
42,"Apr 7, 2021",Jihye you're so cool!
42,"Feb 17, 2021","that Dokja pog face, so hilarious! 😂🤣😂"
42,"Feb 22, 2022","Is it just me or does Dokja act different around  Junghyeok? I don't know how to explain it but he just switches up when he's around him. Ah I dont know, its a bit weird to me. "
42,"Sep 10, 2021",Dokja's passive aggressive smile XD
42,"Jul 27, 2021",these hands rated E for everyone
42,"Jul 1, 2021",damn dokja has fang teemth
42,"Jun 18, 2021","technically the story never states he's dead, just that he's being controlled. if the regressor had died, wouldn't everything been reset by now?"
42,"Jun 8, 2021","Dokja when he hit Junghyeok: I've been waiting for this moment, TURN IT UP"
42,"Jun 2, 2021","I've finished the whole story long ago of course, i know what would happen but the art is far beyond my imagination and expectation that's why i keep on reading the webtoon, compared to those other novel turned webtoons i know.
 In the novel, all seems fast paced for me, but it's not hard so hard to understand if you get to play your imagination right, it's all cool too and rather exciting for me but it's totally different to where it was all serve in silver platter and god-tier arts dayum. "
42,"May 5, 2021",Dokja speedwalking then smacking the living hell out of regressor-kun's head had me dead 🤣
42,"May 2, 2021",She’s an antihero I love
42,"Apr 28, 2021",Can we all agree that the kid will probably be the one that beats him or something 😂
42,"Apr 27, 2021",[the constellation 'fujoshi? hell ya😏' is shocked enough to squish the chocolate in her hand ][5 coins have been sponsored]

42,"Apr 9, 2021","Imma be real and honest with y’all- I’ve read up to chapter 51 on an “alternative platform” I know it’s bad and that it’s basically robbing the author of their webnovel and well deserved pay they should be getting but that’s why I’m here folks. I’m gonna pay for fast pass ONLY if it directly supports the author and everyone who has helped to to translate, clean up, edit etc. I’ll be supporting by liking each chapter and fast passing any chance I get but I’m also poor so I need to make sure."

42,"Apr 7, 2021",Why do I get the feeling Dokja is kind turning into a villain. Hes basically saying he'll use any means necessary to survive. He had no problem using a poor girls trauma to his advantage and even tricked a constellation for a stigma. Hes also killed people. I'm not sure if this'll end on a happy note.

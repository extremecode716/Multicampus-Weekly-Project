Episode,Date,Review
47,"Mar 24, 2021",Imagine you read about a character for 10+ years only for a teenager to think you have a child together LMAOOO
47,"Mar 24, 2021",The Prisoner of the Golden Headband says gay rights! 
47,"Mar 24, 2021","I love this misunderstanding. ""The Secretive Plotter is flabberghasted' ME TOO, ME TOO. LOL"
47,"Mar 24, 2021",I love how Dokja simply gave up and dumped the problem on the sleeping Joonghyuk lol
47,"Mar 24, 2021","""Did you two adopt a child?"" ""Ask Joonghyuk"" Me: *slams table* HE DIDN'T DENY IT"
47,"Mar 24, 2021","dokja: ""i know him better than anyone else in the world"" | also dokja: ""we don't have that kind of relationship tf? where is this idea even coming from, yall wild"""
47,"Mar 24, 2021",junghyeok's sleeping face went from a tiny smug smile to neutral to a frown and finally straight up furrowing his brows. i swear this man's awake
47,"Mar 24, 2021","“Did you two adopt a child?” Yes, Gilyoung"
47,"Mar 24, 2021",Jihye really kickstarted this whole ship with one misunderstanding and she's iconic for that
47,"Mar 24, 2021",I mean let's be real they would make one hell of a power couple 
47,"Mar 24, 2021",When the characters IN STORY start making up fanfics
47,"Mar 25, 2021","Jihye here asks Dokja whether they adopted a child but in the novel it was better. ""But Ahjussi how did you give birth to a child!??"" "" Ask Junghyeok when he wakes up."" Really this was better😂😂"
47,"Mar 27, 2021","Oh my god, you can tell that the whole ‘Dokja and Junhyeok are romantically entangled and have a kid’ is going to be a reoccurring joke. It gives the past interactions where Junghyeok wanted to recruit Gilyeong in a new lens (no he wasn’t trying to recruit him, the father wanted custody over the child! But the kid prefers his other dad! Lol)"
47,"Apr 13, 2021",Junghyeok: *wakes up* “Master is it true? Are you in Dokja in a relationship??” Junghyeok: What the fuc-
47,"Mar 24, 2021",Comradeship. 😏
47,"Mar 25, 2021",The misunderstanding plus the censoring from the last page makes this totally understandable on how the constellations got to this conclusion 🤣
47,"Apr 30, 2021",Lee Jihye isn't the Naval Commander for nothing. Her capacity to even build ships is just outstanding 😂😂😂
47,"Mar 24, 2021","""You're...You're..."" ""Say it. What am I?"" 
""You're gay."" 
😑"
47,"Mar 24, 2021",It's like what he was saying was run through various google translates and different languages and then back into English.
47,"Mar 24, 2021",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' was shocked to discover the words behind the censorship.] [The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' is thrilled that the King's path is now starting.] [5 coins have been sponsored.]
47,"Mar 24, 2021","The prisoner of the golden headband is respectful of your orientation
WUKONG MY MAAAAAAN"
47,"Mar 24, 2021",Absolutely love that Dokja just left unconscious Junghyeok Yu to explain their “adopted child” to Lee Jihye.  Classic. 
47,"Mar 24, 2021","It's crazy to think that there's people who know just the beginning of TWSA so they have an easy time getting by, but once they get past what they know, I feel like they'll be insta-KO'd lol"
47,"Mar 24, 2021",captain uriel has boarded the ship!
47,"Mar 24, 2021",Dokja: Ask Junghyeok Yu when he wakes up...Me: RIP Jihye... 
47,"Mar 24, 2021",I cannot get over Sangah's beauty like she is gorgeous and has an amazing personality that makes you feel like you can trust her. Sangah Supremacy ‼
47,"Mar 24, 2021","Lmao Jihye's interpretation!! She's great 😂 The constellations' reactions too lol Sun Wukong & Uriel approve. Also Sangah, our ivory goddess 🥺 she wants to believe in the good of others but she'll still get shit done if she has to. I respect Pildu's persistence too haha"
47,"Mar 24, 2021","Uriel is a real one 💪  demonic judge of fire said yes to gay rights, but srsly they made yoo Jonghyuk extra pretty this chapter 😳"
47,"Mar 24, 2021","ahhh, the beginning of the 🐟🦑 ship's journey. Uriel is already screaming 😆"
47,"Mar 24, 2021","This webtoon never fails in make me laugh, has good action and excellent plot . I am delighted. "
47,"Apr 26, 2021",The history books are going to write it down as they were VERY good companions 
47,"May 5, 2021",dokja being gifted 600 coins because the constellations think it's bl and they ship it 😂
47,"Apr 29, 2021",Aha imagine Junghyeok waking up to his trainee asking him about their delightful family life before the apocalypse 😭
47,"Apr 27, 2021",I'm loving these constellations more and more. They gave him coins after believing he was gay.  Love it 😂
47,"May 12, 2021","looking forward to when he wakes up and everyone's like ""so, you and dokja, huh?"""
47,"May 12, 2021",Demon-Like Judge of Fire is the president of the Joongdok ship but Lee Jihye is the founder 
47,"Apr 29, 2021",Junghyeok’s reaction to being asked if he has a secret adopted child with Dokja: 👁👄👁
47,"Mar 24, 2021","That's a harsh penalty! Also, the other reader is gonna be pussed when he learns our main guy read until the end!"
47,"Mar 24, 2021",YES THE ICONIC LOVE LETTER SCENE IS HERE AND IT'S HILARIOUS THANK YOU JIHYE 
47,"May 13, 2021","As expected, Naval Commander Jihye Lee knows a ship when she sees one."
47,"May 5, 2021","If you thought this was funny, the webnovel version was 10x more🤣🤣. The translation is different on the webnovel, for example instead of ""What about the resolution you made?"" it was "" That first time, that determination, have you already forgotten?!"" and instead of  ""Did you adopt a child?!"" it was ""How did you give birth?!"" 🤣🤣"
47,"Mar 24, 2021","no spoilers here, but reading the full webnovel is super worth it and makes this webtoon read even more enjoyable :)!"
47,"Mar 29, 2021",one of the funniest  things in this series is the misunderstandings. 
47,"Mar 24, 2021",I see that unconscious Joonghyuk is still here 💀💀 he will always be funny to me
47,"Apr 19, 2021",Sleeping Beauty is going to be furious when he wakes up
47,"Mar 24, 2021","The constellation PRISONER OF THE GOLDEN HEADBAND puts up they hands and says ""you do you booboo"""
47,"Mar 25, 2021",ah the start of uriel fan girling or over djk and yoo joonghuyk 
47,"Mar 24, 2021",Girl I’ve known about them for so long 😩 y’all telling me you don’t see the s*xual tension
47,"Mar 24, 2021",When you become the main character and someone turns the 'protagonist' into your boo 😂
47,"Mar 28, 2021",the secret plotters reaction lmao- He has a reason to be so shocked as well 😭
47,"May 12, 2021",GILYOUNG IS THEIR CHILD 
47,"May 12, 2021",And that's how the constilations turned this into a BL love story.
47,"May 5, 2021","Imagine her asking Junghyeok when he wakes up, can't wait to see his face😂"
47,"May 12, 2021",[The Secretive Plotter is flabbergasted] this is so much funnier as a novel reader 😂
47,"May 12, 2021","And people kept on asking why I ship them, like THE CHARACTERS THEMSELVES ALSO SHIP THOSE TWO HOW CAN I NOT??"
47,"Apr 30, 2021",jihye asking jungheyok about his lover after waking up be like 🤭
47,"Mar 24, 2021",i'm sure there's fanfiction of this specific misunderstanding. and if there isn't - there better be.
47,"Mar 31, 2021",😂😂 the best coming out I’ve seen. Everyone was so pleased by it they gave him money
47,"May 12, 2021","Lmao ""The Prisoner of the Golden Headband is respectful of your orientation"". These are gold messages. "
47,"Mar 24, 2021","Hahah even the constellations ship them! I know there’s no chance of it happening, but I really wish they would end up together . At least, so far, I like their chemistry. "
47,"May 14, 2021","Junghyeok: (wakes up) Jihye: ""m-master.. i've heard you had a child,,"" Junghyeok: ""how did you know?!"" Jihye: ""dokja told me"" Junghyeok: ""that bastard-"" Jihye: ""did you adopt?"" Junghyeok: ""no.."" Jihye: ""you got a surrogate mother??"" Junghyeok: ""the heck you are talking about? ofc no! it's ours!"" Jihye: *surprised pikachu face"
47,"May 12, 2021","""and they were comrades"""
47,"May 12, 2021",in the novel she asked him how he gave birth 💀
47,"Mar 27, 2021",I just love this webcomic and probably should start reading the novel. 
47,"May 14, 2021","Jihye really pulled a ""Finally gonna tell my parents they're gay"""
47,"Mar 27, 2021","Sunfish gonna be confused but probably okay with this, free badass husband! 
This glorious chaos is making my life just a bit better after personal tragedy."
47,"Mar 24, 2021","oh man, i can't wait for the secretive plotter arc djfkdks"
47,"May 12, 2021",these bitches gay good for them good for them
47,"May 12, 2021",Jihye commands multiple kinds of ships
47,"May 12, 2021","I read a different translation that says [The Prisoner of the Golden Headband respects your taste.] Which I personally like better because it just feels like it has more nuance and implication to the statement. But this is still very good, not complaining at all."
47,"Mar 24, 2021","So, Jihye feels that fatherly material in Dokja too? :0 "
47,"May 12, 2021",She full heartedly believes that they are husbands with a kid and everything. I can just smell the comedic potential 
47,"May 12, 2021",Leave it to the high-school girl to change this into a fanfic
47,"Mar 25, 2021",Gilyoung is their adopted child hehe.
47,"May 12, 2021",The fact that Dokja received 600 gold for having a supposed child with the novel's MC 😂😂😂 
47,"Apr 7, 2021",I just came here and paid for the Jongdok. Still love that scene. 
47,"May 12, 2021",THE WAY THEY THREW MONEY @ HIM THE SECOND THEY THOUGHT HE WAS DATING A MAN PLZ IM ROLLING
47,"May 12, 2021",wow i wish i got money for being gay i just got a lot of anxiety instead
47,"Mar 31, 2021",I was waiting for this chap god jihyu 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 and I love those subscribers reaction lol but I think they changed the wording abit cause I remember in the novel jihyu asked dokja how he gave birth not adopted anyway is still really funny how flustered she was
47,"Mar 24, 2021",From this moment onwards Uriel was the captain of a magnificent ship
47,"May 12, 2021","""I know him better than anyone else"" And you expect her not to think you are together Dokja, and to be honest....I think I could see it?"
47,"Mar 25, 2021","I’mHappy for the newly weds :,) "
47,"May 12, 2021","I have been waiting to see the ""love letter"" scene since I read the scene on the novel. Junghyeok and Dokja are one hell of a power couple."
47,"May 5, 2021","I thought I just clicked off my bl story, didn't realize I was reading another. shout out to golden headband, always knew he was gay"
47,"Apr 28, 2021",lowkey ship it 
47,"Nov 9, 2021","the constellations really said ""you're gay? good for you!!! here's 600 coins!!!"" PLS"
47,"May 12, 2021",Guess that reader who gave up early is regretting it now ....
47,"Mar 24, 2021",the reader gave you 5 coins for the funny mistunderstanding
47,"May 12, 2021","I was not expecting to crack up laughing in this serious thriller series, but I lost it at that part. 😂😂😂 Mostly because of the constellations' reactions... The instant acceptance was awesome, and they even gifted him coins before he had a chance to refute it. 😅 I love how he just walks away like ""Well, I guess it doesn't really matter in the long run. Not worth the bother, so they can think what they like. 😅😅😅🤷🏻‍♂️"" Seriously loved how nobody even questioned it though. ❤️"
47,"Aug 17, 2021",he got 600 coins for being gay 😭😭😭
47,"May 12, 2021",The constellations know what's up. More respectful than some people I know...
47,"May 12, 2021","I LOVE that misunderstanding🤣The constellations are like ""Oh alright👀"""
47,"Apr 28, 2021",Um.... looks like junghyeok heard almost everything dokja said 😂 Because in the panel where we last saw junghyeok in this chapter he looked ✨stressed✨
47,"May 18, 2021",Very nice subtle way to work in support for LGBTQ+ without hamfistedly forcing a character to be outwardly gay or get into a relationship when it doeant fit the story. I'm very impressed and pleased.
47,"Mar 26, 2021",LMFAO I WAS WAITING FOR THIS BIT HAHAHAH
47,"May 14, 2021","[ THE CONSTELLATIONS DECLARE THEY'RE FINE WITH KILLING ALL OF HUMANITY, BUT THEY DO DRAW THE LINE AT HOMOPHOBIA ]"
47,"May 13, 2021",Sun Wukong said GAY RIGHTS 
47,"May 12, 2021",I figured it out....their adopted kid is....Gilyeong...
47,"Mar 24, 2021",oh guys!!! there is an official KDJ figurine now!! he looks amazing btw
47,"May 14, 2021","Lol my favorite part is that Dokja just lets Jihye and the constellations believe he’s gay, bc it’s easier than the censorship 😂 Wish that Junghyeok was awake tho, would’ve loved his reaction to the surprise news that he’s got a secret child with Dokja Kim 😂 😂😂"
47,"May 14, 2021",how did she even get to that conclusion? Huiwon heard the same thing and got a different conclusion... I guess this one was easier to understand and believe... why didn't she connect the boy who's traveling with him and is clearly attached to him with her conclusion? I would immediately suspect him as their secret child 😂
47,"May 14, 2021","I love the constellations because they are just fans watching their show and supporting or disapproving their favourite characters. They said ""yay, Dokja is gay, I ship that"" and seriously gifted him coins. I can't breath."
47,"May 12, 2021",PEOPLE don't choose to be gay. LEE JIHYE decides it for you 😂🌈✨
47,"May 17, 2021","I love the fact that now the constellations think they’re gay cuz every time they see them together they’re gonna ship them even though they’re trying to kill each other xD “aww he tried to slash him with the sword how cute” On another note, it makes me wonder who Junghyuk’s wife was and if we’ve already seen her in the story"
47,"May 15, 2021","the constellations rlly said ""oh ur gay?"" *hands u money*"
47,"May 13, 2021","[The constellation, Prisoner of the Golden Headband, is respectful of your orientation.]
That absolutely killed me-"
47,"Jun 23, 2021","""You have been given 600 coins""
Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay."
47,"Jun 9, 2021",THINK ABOUT OUR CHILD 💀
47,"May 13, 2021",LMAO EVERYONE THINKING DOKJA IS LIVING THAT Y/N LIFE 
47,"May 12, 2021",Lee Jihye: I've connected the dots Kim Dokja: you haven't connected sh*t Lee Jihye: ...I've connected them
47,"May 12, 2021",but.. bUT GILYEONG???
47,"May 13, 2021","I'm dead, she thought they were a gay couple, and instead of correcting her he made the decision of leaving it to his ""significant other"", who will probably have a massive f*cking headache, to explain. Or find a way to change the subject."
47,"May 13, 2021","""Wait! But what kid? Did you two adopt a child?""
Yes, and his name is GilYoung"
47,"May 12, 2021",Just imagine Junghyuk waking up and Jihye asking him about the child he has with Dokja 💔😂
47,"May 12, 2021",“Think about our child!!” this is y i love lee jihye 🤚❤️
47,"May 12, 2021",mf got 600 hundred coins cause they thought he was gay 😂😂

47,"May 12, 2021",soo... Isn't the ship of Dokja and Joonghyuk is like the self insert fanfic lol
47,"Mar 24, 2021",Talk about the most epic misunderstanding lol
47,"Sep 25, 2021","That girl really fits the Naval constellation, she’s even creating ships now"
47,"May 19, 2021",Constellations: AND THEY WERE ROOMATES
47,"May 15, 2021",love how dokja pretty much got coins for being gay (not really but you know what I mean) 
47,"May 13, 2021","Hello, just a bit of a rant here. Someone just called Sangah useless and said that they didn't need her, and I just. Like I didn't really like notice her at first, but to just wave her off like that and to like hate her. Yeah Huiwon's great, and Huiwon's my favourite female character here but, like Sangah last episode: pulled them up from an ambush. Sangah this episode: binded ilhun and later covered his mouth as soon as Dokja said so. Sorry for the negative vibes but I have nowhere else to rant"
47,"May 12, 2021",Lolol this is the start of the ship that takes up 80% of all orv fanfics
47,"May 12, 2021","""I wonder how much was censored...""""WE TOLD THEM YOU'RE GAY INSTEAD OF REVEALING EVERYTHING ELSE!"""
47,"Mar 30, 2021",LEE JIHYE WHAT A WONDERFUL MISUNDERSTANDING 
47,"Mar 29, 2021",sun wukong disliking censorship is the funniest thing 😭😭
47,"May 13, 2021","I know this was a joke by the creators but now they gave them the idea… and they won’t stop. 






The ship already left the doc."
47,"May 12, 2021",And this marks the beginning of Uriel’s cult
47,"May 12, 2021",dokja really out here living the dream of everyone who's ever simped for a webtoon character
47,"May 12, 2021","No one :....Not a single reader:....
Not even the guys who write the script for Mexican novelas:.....
The constellations: they HaVe A cHiLD?!?!?

😂😂😂"
47,"Jun 8, 2021",I’m hoping to see Junghyeok Yu’s reaction to this baby they have together 😭
47,"May 18, 2021",Demonic judge of fire is like “and they were roommates”
47,"May 17, 2021","""Think about our child!"" funniest line yet. lol"
47,"May 15, 2021","[the constellation Prisoner of the Golden Headband, is respectful of your orientation]. we love that 💕 edit: what is joonghyuk going to think when he wakes up lmao"
47,"May 14, 2021","Ah finally, my favorite misunderstanding in the whole series. Colorized. "

47,"May 13, 2021",Uriel said 'they were roommates' 😆
47,"May 12, 2021",Can we leave everything behind and talk. About Yoo. Joonghyuk's face while sleeping. He looks so unlike his personality. Like an angel. 
47,"May 12, 2021",I love how the sponsors are misunderstanding everything lol
47,"May 12, 2021",They said : you’re gay? Here have some money
47,"May 11, 2021",i love how the constellations gave him money for being gay...me as a constellation
47,"Mar 24, 2021",Nobody:Me: Making sound effects as I read. 
47,"Nov 9, 2021","the constellations are many things, but homophobic is not one of them :)"

47,"May 12, 2021",The Secretive Plotter is flabbergasted part is hilarious especially if you have read the novel
47,"May 12, 2021","You know what I noticed though? After rereading ORV for several times, I noticed that Kim Dokja never admitted his sexuality XD He actually had been asked about it multiple times but he'd either dodge it or change the topic. Kinda sus 🧐 
kidding aside, i have a feeling he's aromantic. "
47,"Oct 8, 2021",It’s the way I skipped straight to the comments after that part💀
47,"May 19, 2021",The ship doesn't sound like a bad idea yk...

47,"May 12, 2021","Ah, so that's why my friends were so disappointed and tormented the whole time they were reading the novel. Now I get why they say the authors were teasing them so much only to end up at fanfic.net or ao3 LOLOLOL"
47,"May 12, 2021","Can we all admire Jihye for not caring, and the constellations I mean its really nice to see even if he isn't gay (tho he might be in the future?)"

47,"May 12, 2021","That final scenario is ridiculous. 1 Station a day ? And if all stations that have already taken over 1 other station have that scenario, it's going to become an insane carnage. The worst is the ""everyone dies if you don't condition"". Like, Dokja's group has less than 25 people, how are they meant to attack a new station everyday while defending their current station? And as we just saw, you can't just take over colonised fringe stations, you need to take over the main station with the flag."
47,"May 12, 2021",The fact the secret plotter is flabbergasted when he knows what’s going on

47,"May 12, 2021",Huh. So since these Prophets knew that Dokja would be coming... that means there's both of them. One who knows of Dokja's existence (another Prophet) and people who have read parts of the novel (a group of Readers). There's definitely both!
47,"May 12, 2021",Is nobody going to tall about the fact that thos guy literally just said the word 'Choke'?

47,"May 5, 2021",But but...what about the kid??😂😂
47,"May 5, 2021","Hmm I wonder if the prophets are other readers. But perhaps they only have the comic/knowledge of the future as far as they have read. And since Dokja is the only one who read it all, he is the only one who knows and has access to the complete story. "

47,"May 12, 2021",hi. so ive seen comments that this was originally a novel but im confused 1. where can i read it (some say its on webnovel but idk) 2. can i read it for free on webnovel? i dont mind waiting a week for a chapter like here on webtoon. 3.is it worth it? like is it as good as the comic? or should i just follow the comic? 4.how is it written? like how did the novel express the quests written on the blue window?
47,"May 12, 2021",HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
47,"May 12, 2021",did I just got spoiled by an add?
47,"May 12, 2021",I’m quite confused because they clearly said that he was the only reader for ages yet there’s supposed to be other readers? Even if they read about it how would they know about Dokja? Or maybe it’s the guy who wrote it but I have an even harder time believing that

Like if white is valued at 1 station, and by taking another station it turned red which is value of 2, if you have a white flag and take 2 more white stations that's 1+1+1=3 or, like him, if you have white and take a red that's 1+2=3 so do you need more than 3 station value to get Navy, like 5 or 10, or is it how many stations regardless of if that station had higher value? (Like taking a station that got 3 others still only counts as 1?)"

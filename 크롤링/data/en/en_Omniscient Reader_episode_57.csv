57,"Jun 2, 2021",Dokja is such a cute little demon.
57,"Jun 2, 2021","I love how the second he said ""You will kill him"" he got squashed instead XD ""The protagonist"" has no chill and I'm here for it. Also, gotta appreciate how chaotic Dokja is with his plans"

57,"Jun 2, 2021","Webtoon, the book is supposed to have only 5 S's. ""SSSSS-Grade Infinite Regressor"""
57,"Jun 2, 2021","Imagine being Junghyeok Yu, some people just appear out of nowhere and claim to know you and your future and everyone one of them tries to use you. This man really ain't living a good life, knowing part of the future but then having it all mixed up because of some weebs."
57,"Jun 2, 2021",Who’s faster your Blade or my TongueOoooo that was a nice side by side
57,"Jun 2, 2021","Welp having Dokja's expression drawn that way during the sword or tongue panel along with ""punish"" underneath didn't help w/ the direction my brain went 😅 Anyways, the dynamic between those 2 is always fun to see & that avatar really got mushed into tofu or soft clay or something lol. I also got another Sanghee crumb! Can't wait to see Dokja's next plan get put into action~ I love seeing him best others 😎"
57,"Jul 21, 2021",Their bromance is pretty much Junghyeok threatening to kill Dokja every time they meet but not doing it because Dokja is his friend but he doesn't want to admit it.

57,"Jul 21, 2021","Ok I’m kinda curious… did Dokja say SSSSSS all separately, or did he say it like sssssss like a snake? 😂 "
57,"Jun 19, 2021","I think every author wants a fan like Dokja who will stick with them to the end, comment on every chapter and call out plagiarizers for the lying thieving hoe bags they are!

57,"Jul 22, 2021",Gosh. The building of Dojka’s god complex is just fantastic writing. 
57,"Jul 21, 2021","I find very interesting seeing people that know what's going to happen because they read the novel, when the story is about someone that knows what's going to happen because he read the novel.Pretty meta if you ask me."
57,"Jul 21, 2021",This is 4D chess right here
57,"Jul 21, 2021",I guess lazy broke weeb finally went broke
57,"Jul 21, 2021",Dokja is SUCH an a**hole XD I love him so much 
57,"Jul 22, 2021",*Love* the relationship between Kim Dojka and Yoo Jonghyuk 😂
57,"Jun 2, 2021",No hesitation head crush love it 
57,"Jun 2, 2021",so this episode talked about the author and I wanna say a theory I have about him because I believe the author could be the secretive plotter constellation.
57,"Jul 21, 2021",They added so many extra S’s 😂
57,"Jul 21, 2021",I can’t wait for Dokja and the ACTUAL author to meet!
57,"Jun 2, 2021",Dokja here with 4D brain moves.
57,"Jul 22, 2021",Dokja with his 2000 IQ but still idiot and yet I still love the KIM DOKJA
57,"Jul 21, 2021","As a novel reader, I’m so happy that this comic gets so much love from the fans and how they are also in love with Kim Dokja."
57,"Jul 21, 2021",I love Dokja’s and Junghyeok’s relationship lol “Which will be faster your sword or my tongue”. Sounds kinda flirty.😅
57,"Jun 2, 2021","I am absolutely in love with how the authors utilize the concepts of characters, writers, and readers, and even a PLAGIARIST in telling this Story. That's SSSSS-Grade creativity 💯"
57,"Jul 24, 2021",the omniscient reader web novel has 551 chapters. As the wabtoon is following the path of the webnovel and one episode is being released every week it would take approximately 10 years to reach to the end. GET READY FOR THE RIDE OF THE DECADE!!!!
57,"Jul 24, 2021","Continuing from my last comment right below. Junghyeok can't kill Dokja cause he needs him for the two obstacles or scenarios they keep mentioning. So having a failsafe without killing him is his best option. I think the Zarathustra is Anna Croft's group and fighting a prophet will be hard for a regressor. The scenario he can't beat probably relies on luck instead of skill, so he needs Dokja to tell him what is going on. He needs Dokja to fight other prophets. This is just my guess."
57,"Jul 24, 2021","Junghyeok Yu is smart for not staying with Dokja. I don't know how much he knows about Dokja's ability, but if he knew it was from reading something, then staying with Dokja will give Dokja the upper hand as it keeps things close to the story. He needs to do things he normally wouldn't like seeing the cinema boss so Dokja can't figure him out. He can't trust Dokja cause he don't know him, but Dokja knows him which is dangerous. He needs a failsafe plan in the event Dokja is a villain."

57,"Aug 12, 2021","""which will be faster, your sword or my tongue?"" hello? did i hear that shit right? 😳"
57,"Jul 23, 2021",Notice this is starting to go down in views like TWSA.
57,"Jul 22, 2021",when dokja tells the plagiarizer he knows much more than him.....damn he looks handsome alright 
57,"Jul 21, 2021","oooh dokja wants to PUNISH him?? 😏 ""which will be faster your sword or my tongue"". this episode hella gay lemme tell u that."
57,"Jul 21, 2021",Is it just me or does anyone else wonder how this story became so unpopular
57,"Jul 21, 2021","This is hands down one of the top ten webtoons known to man, and that’s final, the story line and ark are just so damn awesome and well written, I love it. Please support the author by liking the episode! 🤗"
57,"Jul 16, 2021","I don't know that using 5 free coins I earned right away was a smart move or not, just bursting with happiness every episode's end is a different cliffhanger that makes me forget reality even just a bit... "

57,"Nov 3, 2021","Come to think of it, it would be terrible if Dokja was the villain. He would be so evil and smart like gosh"
57,"Aug 17, 2021","""Which will be faster? Your sword or my tongue?"" That was kinda hot, Dokja 😳😳"
57,"Aug 10, 2021",I'm just remembering but I wonder what happened after he woke up and Jihye asked about them being lovers and having a kid together 😂😂
57,"Jul 31, 2021",dokja was like: “activate skill [Big Brain Move]”

57,"Jul 21, 2021","""I'd love to see you try. Which will be faster, your sword or my tongue?"" I've been waiting for this scene lol. Yu Junghyeok's murderous personality is funny and a bit nerve inducing. Dokja is really fucking sassy and I love that for him."
57,"Jul 21, 2021",When Dokja gives that innocent smile  you know something is up
57,"Jul 22, 2021","isn't this plagiarizing ""Three Ways To Survive The Apocalypse""?"

57,"Jul 21, 2021","“You’re a little scary sometimes, you know that? Brilliant... but scary” "
57,"Jul 21, 2021","that's a nice commentary about plagiarizing successful series. many webtoons/manga/web novels are just a copy of them. they don't ""add something new"" to the market"
57,"Jul 15, 2021",thats a lot if S's in one title
57,"Jun 9, 2021",This is probably one of the best Webtoons I've read so far. I just wish we didn't have to wait a week
57,"Jun 9, 2021",It's so funny looking to the protagonist of Twsa confronting the protagonist of Omniscient Reader… Lmao
57,"Jun 2, 2021","this is great. the author is low key ripping on all of the new web novels that have this premise. its probably all in fun but you cant deny that as soon as a good format/genre is created, a crap load of copies follow... not that i mind :3"
57,"Jun 2, 2021","'which will be faster, your sword or my tongue?' 😎 happy pride month, folks!! 💗"
57,"Jul 30, 2021",remember that boy who spoke rarely and now look at this super duper cooool Man Dokja!

57,"Jul 22, 2021",I just love the way Dokja pisses Yoo Jonghyuk off 🤣🤣🤣
57,"Jul 22, 2021","I think this might be even BETTER than solo leveling, it's just so addicting, and Dokja Kim just seems to be a better protagonist in general. We'll just have to wait and see, though."
57,"Jul 22, 2021",it's funny how the other comments say it will get better as if it wasn't great before 🤠
57,"Jul 22, 2021",There's nothing better than a crazy mentally unstable MC and we're living for it. 
57,"Jul 21, 2021",My man is pulling the ultimate rick roll
57,"Jul 21, 2021","So there is plagiarism even during an apocalypse?? Smh but Dokja's sexy brain found out a way: ""Plagiarize the plagiarizer"" BAHAHAHAHAHA I'M LOVIN IT"

57,"Jun 16, 2021",Did I miss a post that the author was going on hiatus or should we be worried about the authors health? Hope they are doing okay cause it’s been a couple weeks of silence.

57,"Jul 21, 2021",Okay but what if at one point Junghyeok and Dokja are in an argument and Dokja just blurts out “i know the size of your dick” and junghyeok goes “what” and dokja just walks away backwards in a cloud of mist and says “you heard me”
57,"Aug 25, 2021","that plagiarized work. SSSSSS-grade. you know, I don't think the Mc is quite overpowered enough. needs a few more Ss just to be sure. 🤣"

57,"Jul 21, 2021","Dokja has a lot of guts to confront the protagonist like that every time they meet. I think he’s become very confident in his knowledge of the story and characters and I love it. Also, I knew that guy couldn’t be the author of TWSA. It just didn’t make sense. And now I’m more annoyed that he copied someone else’s work without people noticing (except Dokja). I also really want to know what Junghyeok is thinking right now, with all these prophets and revelators and stuff."

57,"Jul 27, 2021",but how will this work? the Avatar guy is able to spread it because he's only speaking it so he can change the names but he had to avoid using the same names in his novel otherwise it would have been blatantly copyright. and it's not like they're going to use Microsoft words replace feature and to replace the main character's name throughout the SSS grade infinite regressor story so that they can make copies of it so how will this work?

57,"May 13, 2022",I find this episode funny cause there is a web comic thats similar to this called The Lone Necromancer. The only difference is that he didn’t read a web novel. It’s like Sangah having her own story since she never read the novel and she’s quick witted. ( The main character is also good looking just like sangah💘

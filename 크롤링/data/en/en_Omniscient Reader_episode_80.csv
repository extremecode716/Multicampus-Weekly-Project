Episode,Date,Review
80,"Nov 24, 2021",I like the idea that Dokja can throw antagonists off by exposition dumping about their back stories haha
80,"Nov 24, 2021","Just gotta say, the illustrator knows how to make some of the best looking female characters I‚Äôve ever seen"
80,"Nov 24, 2021","You really gotta wonder when people are gonna start picking up on the fact that Dojka knows too much. Regardless, the fact he‚Äôs able to utilize the knowledge he has like this is so insane!"
80,"Nov 24, 2021","‚ÄúThey make a good pair, but they talk like they hate each other.‚Äù Dokja sees in Sang-ah and Han what everyone else sees in him and Junghyeok."
80,"Nov 24, 2021",I love how Dokja is just meeting these guides one by one and pissing them off within minutes of meeting them.
80,"Nov 24, 2021","He insulted her like ""Do you know what you just did? Smh of course you don't"" I love himü§£"
80,"Nov 24, 2021","I think that kdj and yjh talk more to each other now that they have that message thing, like before they didn‚Äôt even have conversations "
80,"Nov 24, 2021","It be funny if Seolhwa falls for Dokja for saving her, and Junghyeok gets another reason to kill him"
80,"Nov 24, 2021","Dokja is completing scenarios, making companions, gaining attention of the constellations and making sure Junghyeok stays sane all at the same time. What a champ"
80,"Nov 24, 2021","Seolhwa's a beauty... but the fact that YJH said ""kill her"" breaks my heart. "
80,"Nov 25, 2021",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' likes the combination the incarnation 'ysa' and 'hsy'.][The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' says that demand for snickers is incredibly high.][5 coins have been sponsored. ]
80,"Nov 24, 2021","I absolutely need to know more, props to the author for making such a compelling story."
80,"Nov 24, 2021","KDJ: So justtt in case I get poisoned, lemme carefully collect a Plan B-"
80,"Nov 24, 2021",Dokja is basically a gamer playing RPG who read all the lore and storyline before hand. and now knows where to get the proper loot to help him help him fight the bosses he‚Äôll face ahead.
80,"Nov 24, 2021",I like that he's appealing to her supporting constellation
80,"Nov 24, 2021",the tension between sangah and suyeong.. hello??? hello????????
80,"Nov 24, 2021",i live for the fleeting sangsoo moment of that one single utterly absolutely dazzling panel
80,"Nov 24, 2021","LEE SEOLHWA IS THE EX EVERYONE. Dokja be like: Damn, Junghyeok sure has a type..."
80,"Nov 24, 2021",I really wanna know what happened to Sangah 
80,"Nov 24, 2021",If this ever becomes an anime ima put everyone on it that I can that‚Äôs a promise.
80,"Dec 29, 2021",bro ngl that panel of seolhwa and junghyeok back to back/upside down is one of the most stunning panels in the comic so far I had to pause just to breathe 
80,"Nov 24, 2021",Dokja is big brain. üß†
80,"Nov 24, 2021",First I cure yer girl. Then I steal yo gurl.
80,"Nov 24, 2021",i can‚Äôt tell if i should be attracted to her or terrified‚Ä¶.
80,"Nov 24, 2021",HAN SOOYOUNG + YOO SANGAH + KIM DOKJA + YOO JUNGHYEOK  = L E G E N D S
80,"Nov 24, 2021",Sangah/Suyeong combi LET'S GOOOOOOOO
80,"Nov 24, 2021",I literally don't ship Kim Dokja with anyone. He's my S O N. He's M I N E.
80,"Nov 24, 2021",Can‚Äôt wait till our boy learns all the skills from the guides. 
80,"Dec 29, 2021",that panel of yjh and seolhwa with the flowers and gears would make suck a beautiful screen saver
80,"Nov 24, 2021",It would be nice if they added more fast pass episodes. I would spend coins üí∞ lol
80,"Dec 29, 2021",‚ÄúThey make a good pair but they talk like they hate each other‚Äù Dokja now u understand us
80,"Dec 29, 2021",How am I still surprised when Dokja's 10 steps ahead from everyone... it's kinda sweet that he probably always planned to keep Seolhwa alive bc of Junghyeok's mental state
80,"Dec 29, 2021","i love orv so much because it's rare to see female characters be powerful and not fall into the stereotypical ""strong but a bitch"" archetype. i also love that all female characters that have been introduced so far could absolutely throttle dokja in a fistfight, no coins used or weapons or anything, just raw power. literally demolish him. i love to see it "
80,"Nov 24, 2021","This gets better every time, I really can't wait for whats next."
80,"Dec 29, 2021","imagine you fighting a dude and he just up and tells you ur entire life story past, present, and future. I'd shit myself in horror and confusion."
80,"Dec 29, 2021","So, this webtoon will go on for a total of ten years, correct?"
80,"Dec 29, 2021","Two things: first, I really, REALLY want to read Three Ways to Survive an Apocalypse. Secondly, is it just me or are the women getting more beautiful as this Manhwa goes on?"
80,"Dec 29, 2021",Han Sooyoung and Yoo Jonghyuk's height difference in that one panel of Sooyoung carrying Jonghyuk lol
80,"Dec 29, 2021",Honestly I can see YJH‚Äôs taste. Seolhwa is indeed a beauty.
80,"Dec 29, 2021",The artist(s) really know how to use lighting to their advantage to make things look extra amazing. The panel with the 2 portraits of the ladies was fantastic.
80,"Nov 24, 2021",[constellation leedraki is intrigued at this development and wants to know what happens next. 5 coins have been donated]
80,"Dec 29, 2021",Cant wait for Dokja to get his new outfit ! Seolwha is so pretty üò≠
80,"Dec 29, 2021",that panel between Seolhwa and Junghyeok is literally breathtaking üò´üò´
80,"Dec 31, 2021","Dokja loves to piss off Junghyeok but you can also tell he's striving to save him from his cursed fate, not only because he definitely needs him (he's the mc of twsa and far more powerful than him, as we all know) but also because, despite Junghyeok being an asshole, Dokja did love his character..."
80,"Dec 29, 2021","here, I'm still waiting for my favourite character. Jeong Huiwon. where are you mi'lady T^T"
80,"Dec 29, 2021",I just gotta say Dokja is so fucking cool üíÖ
80,"Dec 31, 2021",Idk where you all live. But Happy New Year! I hope that the ORV webtoon will reach new heights in 2022 and that the fandom will expand greatly!
80,"Dec 29, 2021","Kim Dokja: I hate that Yu Junghyeok, what a bastardAlso Kim Dokja: [puts his own life and other lives at risk to save someone just because they're important to Junghyeok]"
80,"Nov 27, 2021",Is it me or is Dojka getting more attractive by the episode üò≥
80,"Jan 3, 2022","Yes Dokja, although they act like they hate each other, they make a good pair. Just like you and Junghyeok "
80,"Dec 30, 2021",Omg did anyone realize the big tension between Sangah and Suyeong??! Like they stare each other so cold and deathly 
80,"Dec 29, 2021",holyyy fck Seolhwa is rlly prtty

80,"Dec 29, 2021","""Remaining time: 7 days"" no need to remind us. It's hard enough to wait that long"
80,"Dec 29, 2021",I like the fact that he doesn't have main character luck in this world but is still in control by his knowledge.
80,"Dec 29, 2021",i mean who wouldnt fall for Seolhwa üò´
80,"Dec 30, 2021",even with this kind of knowledge I don't think I'll survive the first minute of the first scenario 
80,"Dec 29, 2021",AYO no he just yeeted her like that üò≠
80,"Dec 29, 2021",Dokja every time that has a Twsa character as enemy: I know your own live better than yourself soo let's end this now or prepare for every single of your weakness at once or Blackmail
80,"Dec 29, 2021","Hope he doesn‚Äôt accidentally steal her heart, Junhyeok Yu would be angry af XD
And also be a bit troublesome to remedy (imo?)"
80,"Dec 29, 2021",i am SO gay for all the women in this series idc
80,"Nov 25, 2021",love the way the artist portrays strong women and not just sexy women. they're sexy AND strong
80,"Nov 24, 2021",[The Constellation Dark Dreamer is early today thanks to webtoon's donation.] [I am broke but I'll support this webtoon with my life on the line.] [üò∂]
80,"Jan 2, 2022","Plot is God Level, EXQUISITE."
80,"Dec 29, 2021",I just finished v1 of the light novel because I couldn‚Äôt keep waiting for these weekly updates and all I can say is we are in for a treat. This adaption is so well done and definitely one of my favourite manhwa‚Äôs.

80,"Dec 31, 2021","I‚Äôve finished reading the novel a few days ago ( if you see this comment, no worries, no spoilers. The novel is really good if you wanna give it a read ^^ ) and the person illustrating these really captured the emotions well :D "
80,"Dec 31, 2021",women <3
80,"Dec 30, 2021",SHE'S SO PRETTY
80,"Dec 30, 2021",lol so like.... is like half of what dokja says censored? üòÇ he knows so much he shouldn't. 
80,"Dec 30, 2021",i felt attacked when he called out Jungheok for having a type like man he ain't the only one
80,"Dec 29, 2021","Dudeeeeee, the panels are beautiful "
80,"Dec 29, 2021","dokja's always prepared, he's not the mc for nothing yenno "
80,"Dec 29, 2021",so when does the people realize that Dokja knows too much ain't that a little bit suspicious if I were one of his acquaintances I'll think that he's the author
80,"Dec 29, 2021",Dokja out there doing multitasking with multimotive for multi-emotions with multi- personality
80,"Dec 29, 2021","Uhm, novel readers?? I don't want to compare these two but I'm just kinda curious about this... does this ORV webtoon missed a lot of good points/parts on the novel orrr... they are somehow, still following the flow of the novel? I mean like in short, do they really follow the flow in the novel or nah?"
80,"Dec 18, 2021",spendingg all my money for Dokja üò©üßé‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
80,"Apr 4, 2022","w,w,,w,,,,women,,,"
80,"Apr 3, 2022",Just realized that the motive of all kdj's acts so far is mainly to protect yjh's state of mind.
80,"Mar 15, 2022","I guess YJH really has a thing for people opposite to him. Seolwa and Dokja are both opposite of him in different ways lol. Yet, there are so many similarities like these two using the same skin moisturizer. "
80,"Mar 13, 2022",i feel like a new ship has formed- sangah and han (aka enemies to lovers aka dokja and jungheok 2.0)
80,"Jan 4, 2022",Shout out to the author for this amazing storyline. Im always on my toes and whenever I think I got something figured out‚Ä¶PLOT TWIST! The artist is talented too. The art really brings the story to life and the execution of it is *chef kiss*

I wanted to continue üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ I loved it soo much"
80,"Jan 2, 2022","Seeing them like this really is something. It‚Äôs amazing how far they‚Äôve come. And poor Seolhwa‚Ä¶ she didn‚Äôt deserve this. Of course, few of the Ten Evils were truly strong, but Antinus inhabiting her, with her power to heal, was the worst possible outcome. Though, I would argue the survival of the world also depends on her survival, given how important she is to Junghyuk. And how she can make that medicine‚Ä¶"
80,"Dec 31, 2021",Hi author i just wanted to say that i love this series so much i would like to kiss and make out with it
80,"Dec 31, 2021",I bet 5 coins she's gonna fall in love with dokja instead of joonghyuk

80,"Jan 16, 2022","Dokja really is a scary guy, you know? He can predict almost everything that will happen bc he knows it will happen, and can also come up with solutions to all those problems"
80,"Jan 5, 2022","in the novel the midday rendezvous was named 'midday tryst', and I searched what 'tryst' means, and it is 'a private romantic rendezvous between lovers.'. So if the tryst is between kdj and yjh..."
80,"Jan 3, 2022",This is masterpiece‚ú®

80,"Dec 29, 2021",It's kinda sad with how Jonghyuk immediately told Dokja to kill Seolhwa though. Really shows how he finds himself needing to sacrifice everything in order to make it through the scenarios. idk I suck at explaining.
80,"Dec 29, 2021",Omniscient Reader and Jungle Juice just had a crossover episode lol

80,"Mar 27, 2022",this kinda reminds me of solo leveling why the hell im addicted of the both?!üóø

80,"Nov 25, 2021",how can every episode of this webtoon be so amazing and always leave me excited for the next one...!
80,"Nov 24, 2021","as I thought from reading the book, kind of imagined it just like that, normally. oof best thing about from webtoon to the novel, bringing out a good picture out of the novel. like transition to the meditating guide eyes open and transition to fight. best so far.. so far it's a long book this author is dedicated to making it, and I'm there buying it lol "
80,"Dec 29, 2021","Maybe they don‚Äôt hate each other Dokja, maybe it‚Äôs just attraction that they cover with snarky remarks it tends to happen from time to time"

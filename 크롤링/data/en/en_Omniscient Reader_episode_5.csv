5,"Jan 16, 2022","I mean I know a lot of you are saying ‚Äúthey can just kill a bug‚Äù but in a moment of pressure and commotion people can really easily forget that a living organism applies to a bug also, so yeah I would be shitting my pants instead of thinking the basic of biology that‚Äôs why props to those who can think properly in a life or death situationüò´üôåüèª"
5,"Jan 9, 2022",Since it said kill a living organism it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs limited to just humans so what if you take the roaches the kid was holding in his box and killed them? I think that would count.
5,"Jan 7, 2022",there is an entire container full of crickets that a kid is holding. kill them. it‚Äôs not hard
5,"Jan 5, 2022",what about them cicadas that kid had. Its a living organism probably.
5,"Jan 4, 2022",Spray hand sanitizer on yourself or parts of the train. Now you have killed some living organism (bacteria) without the need to kill a person. Mission complete.

5,"May 5, 2021",I‚Äôve been hoping the last two episodes that people would just be smart and kill the bugs that little boy has. I guess they‚Äôll end up doing that cuz otherwise the author wouldn‚Äôt have made it a point to show us them. 
5,"May 1, 2021",Namwoon Kim sounds like Namjoon Kim 
5,"May 1, 2021",kill the cockroaches you idiots!

5,"Apr 13, 2021","If the punishment is death, if you killed yourself, wouldn't you complete the challenge and be ressurected ?"
5,"Apr 11, 2021",I guess the author doesn't know that we literally kill millions of microorganisms every time we breathe
5,"Apr 7, 2021",why is everyone overestimating humanity's capability of being calm and collected and undestimating the cleanliness of the car lol
5,"Mar 10, 2021",Remind me of Alice in the borderland??!

5,"Jan 17, 2021","So I've been putting off reading this comic bc I wanna binge-read and now that I'm 4 eps in I cant put it down. From the art to the story line, everything is just purely amazing! "

5,"Oct 17, 2020",why don't they kill that boy's roaches instead?
5,"Oct 17, 2020","yeah, I was thinking about the natural microorganisms that live on our skin and stuff. Can't someone just borrow a lighter, burn a patch of skin, and count it as killing 1,000,000 bacteria?"
5,"Oct 16, 2020",if they were outside they could have just picked a flower or a thing of grass. since they're down there they could try to look for a bug or a rat. maybe even clean to kill germs. it's a huge advantage that the rules don't specifically say to kill another person
5,"Oct 15, 2020","It's just horrible that they ahd to kill that old woman and that little kid had to see them doing that. Also, what will Dokja do?"

5,"Apr 26, 2021","oh that's interesting!! it's like he's being given the chance to be a parallel protagonist! so he might follow the army lieutenant to the 'real' protagonist, and be shadowing the storyline from there!"

5,"Aug 26, 2020","From the beginning, I‚Äôve wondered if killing a bug or anything living would qualify, since the rules said ‚Äúliving organism‚Äù not ‚Äúhuman.‚Äù This, of course, would need to be verified by the demon, which may be risky, due to it‚Äôs volatile nature. But if it did qualify, *squish those bugs and sanitize as fast as possible, people * "

I wasn't a fan of the side characters having more going on in the background framing device but it has grown on me.

5,"Aug 26, 2020",THIS IS SO GOOD
5,"Aug 26, 2020",So I‚Äôve been thinking about this. It said any living organisms. That would count as animals right. I can imagine a kid holding an Ant farm and someone just takes the glass and shatters it and tells everyone to step on only one ant....poor ants 
5,"Aug 26, 2020",Thank you WEBTOONs for a way to  read unordinary for free so my dad dont gotta bitch about me spending his card for 1$ twice a month

5,"Aug 26, 2020",ummm... so if you can kill any LIVING organisms can maybe they should use sanitizers. That'll do the thing. right? Or there was a little guy with an insects collection right? Beetles or something. They might also count
5,"Aug 26, 2020",Wait if they just want some living ORGANISMS to die can‚Äôt they all just kill some bacteria or ü¶† with sanitizers? Nobody said that it had to be HUMANS who should be killed 
5,"Aug 26, 2020","It sux that I can read all this rn in the other app, but it is so much better this way. Edit: but altogether, so far it‚Äôs AMAZING keep up the hard work author"

5,"Aug 21, 2020","I absolutely have to give a shout-out to the attention to detail here. In the novel, one of the people beating up the old lady was Gilyoung‚Äôs mother. (Kid with the bugs). You can see her in the previous chapters sitting next to Gilyoung with a red shirt. Well done guys."

5,"Sep 11, 2022",This series has a big problem with disparity of knowledge between Dokja and readers. Dokja always has crucial knowledge beforehand but he doesn't share it with readers. Instead information is only given when needed. Items and other things have hidden functionalities and features that Dokja just knows. Any problems that appear are already known by Dokja and he has a solution prepared that he can just showoff. By 80 ep he is yet to explain the overarching story of twsa and his plan for survival.

5,"Jul 12, 2021",My impressions so far. It is quite cliched and slow story. Too much build up. I was literally screaming for 4 chapters.. get that insect box from the boy and kill an insect. Does the author think we‚Äôre bloody idiots? Was killing insect his big reveal after 4 chapters of unnecessary drama??

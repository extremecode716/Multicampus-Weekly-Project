Episode,Date,Review
25,"Oct 21, 2020",[Fourth Wall Reader] Enjoys seeing the revolution and justice being swiftly executed. 5 coins have been sponsored.
25,"Oct 21, 2020",Once you get this far into a fast pass there is no goin back.
25,"Oct 21, 2020",I dont know how you have managed so many back to back days and have maintained such a high quality. one of my favorite guilty pleasures for awhile now. shut up and take my coins! 
25,"Oct 21, 2020","Anyone notice how his name is Minsang Han and he‚Äôs now missing his hands?
Edit: There‚Äôs chapters further than FastPass online for free üòâ Thanks ü§ôüèΩ"
25,"Oct 21, 2020",I think it‚Äôs important that he doesn‚Äôt think of himself as the protagonist so he can make cold decisions and understand the bad guys just as well as the good guys.
25,"Oct 21, 2020",Anyone else think the Secretive Plotter is the Author for TSAW.
25,"Oct 21, 2020",OMG Dokja cut the guys arms off so that other people could kill them and get the coins needed to survive or he did it so they can‚Äôt trade for their life either way this just shows how smart Dokja is
25,"Oct 21, 2020",He didn‚Äôt even need the Incite Skill to start a revolution. He‚Äôs just that smart and manipulative.
25,"Oct 21, 2020",im glad that they gave a scene to the mother and child... 
25,"Oct 21, 2020","WOW, I love how that one girl leveled as a major heroic player. "
25,"Oct 21, 2020",I can just tell by chapter 100 every character in this squad is gonna be broken beyond comprehension
25,"Dec 9, 2020","Ah I love Jung Heewon, shes one of my favourite characters. The author actually writes female characters well and doesn't make them backround characters and give them the same importance as the male characters, they're personalities are different from eachother that you can actually distinguish them from eachother if someone described their personalities to you."
25,"Oct 21, 2020",O___O The Constellations aren‚Äôt the only ones feeling intense ecstasy right now! THAT WAS ::Pterodactyl Screaching:: !!!!
25,"Oct 21, 2020",I am so devoted to the series that when a new chapter comes out and I‚Äôm done with it..... waiting that seven days is literally like going through withdrawalü•∫üò≠
25,"Oct 21, 2020",Badass Good Girl = HELL YEAH
25,"Oct 21, 2020",I hope they will adapt this into an anime. The way things are going now it will be a great comic.
25,"Oct 21, 2020",Damn she really just slayed everyone. Good on her. 
25,"Oct 21, 2020",The constellations of <Webtoon> have deemed the opponents as evil and are happy with their swift execution. 5 coins have been sponsored.
25,"Oct 29, 2020",Constellation prisoner of the golden headband finna pull out all his hair by the end of the next few episodes if he keeps at it
25,"Oct 21, 2020",im really feeling this one. loose ends are taken care of without any hesitation and characters developing with amazing results!
25,"Nov 5, 2020",I got chills! Seeing a woman evolve into a more powerful character gives me intense joy
25,"Oct 21, 2020","Ah yes, the and thus the (loyal to the main protagonist to the end) character is born "
25,"Oct 28, 2020",the secretive plotter cracks me up every chapter lol
25,"Oct 21, 2020",Ohhhh just noticed that the white haired girl when Huiwon blossoming foreshadows something lol
25,"Oct 26, 2020",Thanks to that 5 day survivor challenge thing (can‚Äôt recall actual name) I became so invested in this story that I spent my 5 free coins on the next episode. Then I just couldn‚Äôt help myself and fast passed all the Fast Pass episodes. Obviously it was not free. And normally I don‚Äôt pay for things like this. BUT I am going to continue to pay for this. It is by far the BEST comic I‚Äôve read on WEBTOON to date and I doubt I‚Äôll find one more interesting and thrilling to me! Well done Author!!!
25,"Oct 21, 2020",Yes! I was waiting for Jung Heewon‚Äôs awakening! It‚Äôs one of my favorite parts of the early story! üòéüî•
25,"Oct 21, 2020",I wish I could go into a hibernation chamber so that when I wake up I can binge read this again once more
25,"Oct 21, 2020",This is by far one of the best we toons EVER!
25,"Oct 21, 2020",to the creater of this comic this is a excellent read I will give 5 coins as often as you update I'm a huge fan of your writing and thank you for keeping me distracted from the real world
25,"Dec 9, 2020","mr. golden headband, please calm down your hair loss is getting worse-"
25,"Dec 9, 2020","AGHH I'M SO HAPPY THAT PEOPLE LIKE AND SUPPORT ORV. I read the novel last year and I LOVED IT. But at that time, there weren't a lot of people who read ORV so I was very disappointed. ( I know that it was very popular in Korea tho but still..) Now I'm thrilled to look at the comments section and see other people's reactions to it. I'm so satisfied that it has the large fandom that it 1000%deserves."
25,"Dec 9, 2020","I really like how Dokja is not exactly the stonger character, but the smartest"
25,"Oct 29, 2020","Time of Judgement is a better translation than Judgement Time from the webnovel ‚Äì it sounds something straight from the bible. On the other hand, I prefer Judge of Destruction rather than Judge of Evil. I think the former fits Huiwon better, especially taking into account the future chapters."
25,"Dec 9, 2020",Prisoner of the Golden Headband must be wearing that headband to cover the bald spots from all the times he pulled his hair out with excitement. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
25,"Dec 9, 2020",Prisoner of the Golden Headband is gonna be bald by the end of the story.
25,"Oct 21, 2020",*[The Constellations of the channel are experiencing intense ecstasy]*same my dudes

25,"Dec 9, 2020",Dokja lucky he saved her because now she is one of his greatest allies!!! Also Dokja has quite a few loyal people following him! Also the Judge was in the house and she gave them all the death penalty.
25,"Dec 9, 2020","I wish I could talk to the creator of this, it‚Äôs one of the best webtoons I‚Äôve read, it puts morals and judgment in a new and exciting way that makes me want to read so much more. I think even Tower Of God might be second place to this amazing story and art! Alright rambling done üòÇ"
25,"Dec 10, 2020",imagine getting your period while going through this shit oh the nightmare
25,"Dec 10, 2020",We‚Äôre... we‚Äôre keeping huiwon jeong right?! She‚Äôs part of the team now right?!
25,"Dec 9, 2020",The whole station was covered in dead bodies and blood bath and then there is- [THE CONSTELLATIONS OF THE CHANNEL ARE EXPERIENCING INTENSE ECSTASY] - that was pure sadistic
25,"Dec 9, 2020","We, now we can confirm that she is one of the most BADDEST CHARACTERS IN THIS COMIC."
25,"Dec 9, 2020",what the constellations say IS THE FUNNIEST PART 
25,"Oct 21, 2020","another fantastic chapter, while sad so many of the easily influenced died they at least did so redeeming themselves and thinking for once. im glad he changed her from a demonic butcher to a good aligned judgment. he's made 4 very strong and influential friends so far and I hope to see him continue to be surprised. nothing beats dokja being surprised by new things happening in a world so familiar to him"
25,"Dec 9, 2020","This is a super minor detail but the dialogue for the panel when the mom asks her son to ""do exactly as i say"" was actually ""do exactly like we did before (in the train)"" in the novel. Just a minor detail but it shows how everyone that survived up to this point is no longer an 'innocent' or 'good' human."
25,"Dec 9, 2020",... I just wanna read the whole thing in one go
25,"Dec 9, 2020","I read almost all the novel and man, it just hits different with the drawings , the visual are gorgeous. The good thing about reading the novel is that there is more information in it but it‚Äôs hard to picture the story. It‚Äôs a good thing to read the WEBTOON and the novel"
25,"Dec 9, 2020",its so sad knowing that the light novel only has like 500 chapters and completed. I don't want this gem to end.
25,"Dec 9, 2020","You can support the author by reading the novel this is based on under the same title, officially translated at Webnovel.com"
25,"Dec 9, 2020",OMG I STAN HER SO MUCH
25,"Oct 29, 2020","guy is missing two hands and his name is ""Minsang Han""..... really?"
25,"Dec 10, 2020","I just have to pause a moment to say how amazing the artwork is! dont get me wrong, the story itself keeps me coming back each time it updates,  but look at that artwork! love this webtoon so so much!"
25,"Dec 9, 2020",I LOVED this moment for Huiwon!! come through justice!!! She slew them in righteous fury and it was marvelous to witness. And after she killed Inho she beat him til she collapsed and I don't blame her. That is catharsis. Her telling Dokja to stand down was what dreams are made of. BAD! ASS! I don't do ships in this comic cuz it seems so trivial but she's definitely Dokja's equal.
25,"Dec 9, 2020",oh my damn! anyone else feel the need to play fruit ninja after this episode!? ü•ùü••üçâ
25,"Dec 9, 2020",I just felt so sad for the mom and child t.t
25,"Dec 10, 2020","I've been waiting for Hour of Judegment! I'm glad she's taking care of things, and I appreciate the manhwa a lot bc in the novel Kim Dokja comes off as very cold and emotionless in these beginning scenarios. It does have to do with the fourth wall off setting some of his emotions (numbing them) but still...I can't wait for them to get to the next station and other scenarios!"
25,"Dec 9, 2020",Im so happy seeing Jeong Huiwon evolve as strong badass woman. Will the other be able to evolve like her?
25,"Dec 9, 2020","it makes so much sense that Huiwon Jeong got ""judge of evil"" after evil was done to her out in the gas"
25,"Apr 28, 2021",CAN WE PLEASE TALK ABT THE MOM WHO GAVE THEIR CHILD A HAMMER SJJDDMCN
25,"Apr 8, 2021","you know what I really appreciate? the women aren't drawn to pose in overly sexualized ways. like so many forms of media out there draw women to be in poses like standing with her back turned and body twisted in a way to emphasize their their breast and hips, even if they're in the middle of a fight. here, Huiwon's movements are realistic for a person fighting. they aren't even afraid to give her fierce and scary expressions that would make her look less ""feminine""."
25,"Dec 10, 2020",The readers are also experiencing an intense ecstasy! 
25,"Dec 9, 2020",yea i have a crush on huiwon now
25,"Oct 21, 2020",I love how the constellations are really just personifications of us the readers. Especially Sun Wukong that man can sense cliffhangers
25,"Apr 28, 2021",the prisoner of the Golden headband has a lot of hair to pull out don't it?
25,"Apr 27, 2021","at this rate, ‚Äúprisoner of golden headband‚Äù is gonna go baldüò≠"
25,"Feb 13, 2021",i was thinking that the girl was side character but she's the boss „ÉΩ(ÔΩÄ‚åí¬¥)„Éé
25,"Dec 16, 2020",This comment section is so wholesome and smushy. Like one part are the webnovel readers being happy because of the recognition it's getting and the other are the new reader's being excited and theorizing about. Ahh now I understand the feeling of being a fan of something and having it blow up.
25,"Dec 10, 2020",I love to see a badass female character like herüòçüòçüòç
25,"Dec 10, 2020",Lovin this!! ...Hate cliffhangers? Read the novel. You won‚Äôt regret it. Up with this webtoon! (And down with gratuitous spoilers!)
25,"Dec 9, 2020",When you read ‚ÄúThis Episode Contains Depictions of Violence that May Be Upsetting for Some Readers‚Äù you know that shit‚Äôs gonna be GOOD
25,"Dec 6, 2020","not opening webtoon for a month so I can read this without having a cliff hanger. open webtoon, read all of it in an hour and bought more with coins and surprise....the cliff hanger is still there mocking me! #sigh"
25,"Dec 9, 2020","I love how morally gray this story is. No known villain, no overly heroic characters. My kind of story."
25,"Sep 4, 2021","It just amazes me how fearless huiwa is. Just days ago she was passed it on the floor, but grew this strong in so little time. And she killed all those people who tried to take advantage of her and the others. Honestly loving her character. "
25,"Jul 21, 2021",every chapter is incredible but this one in particular‚Ä¶.huiwon‚Äôs crouching figure development was just so beautiful and dynamic. i spent so much time looking at each frame <3
25,"Jan 15, 2021",You know shit got real when we saw the mother giving her child a hammer.
25,"Dec 15, 2020",can we get an anime of this...pls 
25,"Dec 14, 2020",I like how the mother said here little tummy hold this hammer and do as I say
25,"Dec 10, 2020","One of the best chapter i've read.The mother who gives a hammer to her son for his survival.
The weak people figthing against the strong.
Huiwon who so bad ass.
Then the end... the tears, the silence. Goddness.
But the more creepy thing ? This message : [The constellations of the channel are experiencing intense ectasy]. They're doing the same thing we are. And maybe the same thing Donkja did when he was reading the weebtoon. Wow. Just wow."
25,"Dec 9, 2020",[Anonymous Reader is thoroughly impressed with the attention to detail in this chapter]
25,"Dec 9, 2020",damn these comment in top are all back in October.well they must have lots of coins and I barley have any but it was worth it ü§£ü§≠üòèüòåüò¢
25,"Dec 9, 2020","This is sad, but the outcome was something I expected... But the worst part is... the glasses guy is very likely to be still around."
25,"May 7, 2021","newfound family, strong protagonist, strong women, great plotline, exciting action scenes, amazing art style and most of all: hilarious. This webtoon has EVERYTHING"
25,"Apr 1, 2021",OMFG SEEING HER IN HER JUDGMENT TIME IS SO SATISFYING
25,"Mar 21, 2021",Damn the Constellation is Having an ORGASM during the stream.
25,"Dec 16, 2020",Mom teaching child how to kill. Parenting
25,"Dec 14, 2020",I may or may not have a crush on justice girl right now üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è
25,"Dec 12, 2020",She did it for the good of everyone and because she has to punish evil doers but after the rage subsided she realized she just murdered tens of people with her own hands. That reality had to hurt
25,"Dec 10, 2020","Minsang Han, more like missing hand lol"
25,"Dec 10, 2020",when the girl dying From poison few chapters after she the ‚ú®Bad Bitch‚ú®
25,"Dec 9, 2020",okay but I think this is long overdue but dokja in a black shirt looks awesome..also huiwon blossoming into her strength was such a great moment I keep re-reading it 
25,"Dec 9, 2020",What a shame all top comments are idiots who only talk about coins instead of something related to the comic
25,"Dec 9, 2020","I honestly wish I had money in order to spend coins on your chapters in support. This WEBTOON since day one has grabbed me in it‚Äôs clutches and has such a good plot line, amazing art and the system behind it is as good as Tower of God, Mistborn, and other likened novels."
25,"Dec 9, 2020",wow i am Extremely gay for huiwon üò≥üò≥üò≥
25,"Dec 2, 2020",this is webtoon is going to be huge. i just know it.
25,"Dec 10, 2020","I wish i could say shut up and take my coins too, but im just a jobless human being still stuck with studying for medicine"
25,"Dec 9, 2020",I love how Dokja doesn‚Äôt act so stereotypically ‚Äúgood‚Äù but somehow gets more and more people who become loyal to him. 
25,"Dec 9, 2020","So all the strong characters have black hair, good to know."
25,"Apr 26, 2021",the prisoner of the golden headband is such a mood lmao 
25,"Mar 19, 2021",Now THATS how you write a badass female character. Good job to the writer
25,"Feb 21, 2021",I believe that's Neutral Good or is it Chaotic Good?
25,"Jan 16, 2021",yesssssss the protagonist is not moral good so there's a heroic party member to balance it out. and she is the JUDGE OF EVIL
25,"Jan 13, 2021",‚ÄúGet Up.‚Äù A queen should never lower her head or else her crown may fall. Dokjin thank you for pulling her up.
25,"Dec 28, 2020",reading the manhwa after the novel reminds me again how cool Jung Huiwon is. She‚Äôs amazing. 
25,"Dec 19, 2020",Prisoner of the Golden Headband sure does pull his hair out a lot.
25,"Dec 18, 2020",it‚Äôs so refreshing to see powerful women in comics 
25,"Dec 15, 2020",I have never felt more dirty minded than when he said ‚Äú They must have done IT‚Äù I-I‚Äôm sorry please continue...
25,"Dec 14, 2020","I wonder if Dokja since he didnt choose a constellation, if he'll become one himself, the omniscient readerquick edit 
did I say something someone else said?"
25,"Dec 14, 2020",Bruh u have no idea how much i just wanna hug the kid rn.
25,"Dec 14, 2020",... did they really just pick a fight with the group that came back with actual weapons instead of a shitty stick that was on timothy‚Äôs front yard
25,"Dec 14, 2020","lol, in the panel where dokja is talking about getting coins when killing someone, bihyeong is just chilling in amusement "
25,"Dec 10, 2020",This WEBTOON is gonna be elite if it keeps this up

25,"Apr 27, 2021","The woman who's teaching her child how to kill....I applaudüëè... But it seems better to do the deed urself and give him the coins, but he also needs to learn how to survive ü§î"
25,"Apr 27, 2021","The costellation who's  always pulling his/her hair... Plz stop, that's not healthy üíÄ"
25,"Mar 20, 2021",I love how she‚Äôs crying. Even if he was a terrible person killing isn‚Äôt easy and this comic still has a sense of realism.
25,"Mar 14, 2021",Huiwon is swiftly becoming my second favorite character after Dokja himself. She‚Äôs tied for second place with the kid.

25,"Dec 10, 2020",I love that this webtoon doesn‚Äôt shy from blood and pointy objects like so many others do. I‚Äôve seen so many great thriller manhwa that could be improved further without censorship

25,"Dec 9, 2020","Huiwon is so cute, she can be so rude when killing and then felt sorry after that"
25,"Dec 9, 2020",so we just gonna ignore how someone got the most powerful judge weapon during the 1st level? and how a little kid can control insects and even summoned a bigass pray mantis?
25,"Dec 9, 2020",dokja barely participated in the second half of the fight yet he‚Äôs still probably the coolest one standing for some reason

25,"Oct 23, 2020","i just did some thinking and rereading and i think i have a theory. could it be possible that the secretive plotter is actually the author of TWSA? dokja didn't recognize the constellation and guessed they were weak, but they knew about him from the beginning. "

25,"May 4, 2021",I dont know if she really did of because of her personality or because of the coins. She monopolized the coins. She even told the mc to let her handle it
25,"May 3, 2021","Watching the mom give that kid a hammer... üò≥ü§î It's horrible, but that's exactly what the kid needs to survive in this messed up world."

25,"Oct 22, 2020",Loving this adaptation so much. I highly recommend reading the light novel if you haven't already so far they been following 1 to 1. So you can read Chapter 24 where we are now and go to Chapter 25 in the light novel from here on.

25,"Oct 21, 2020","Well damn, this webtoon is too amazing, the constellations have made me stuck in a fast pass loop"
25,"Oct 21, 2020",I think reader's are a lot like the constellations in this since they're always talking about getting excited from violence and action and getting agitated when things happen that they don't like. Even the good constellations aren't really good because they're still perpetuating violence by putting the humans in these situations. Not saying being a reader is bad but some people often try and force the way a narrative goes and get angry when it doesnt go there way.

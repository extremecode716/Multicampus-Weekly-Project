Episode,Date,Review
87,"Jan 12, 2022",Can we all just agree Dokja is a living UNO reverse card at this point.
87,"Jan 12, 2022",All hail scammer Dokja! Bihyeong punched that dokkaebi so hard that space is no longer a vacuum 🤣
87,"Jan 12, 2022","Kim Dokja be like trade deal: you build a link to Bihyeong’s channel, we receive all your constellations, coins, and viewers, and you get ✨nothing✨"
87,"Jan 12, 2022","We in the business call that ""getting fucked"". "
87,"Jan 12, 2022",I’m so glad Dokja didn’t betray Bihyeong and actually made his channel grow even more. They’ve become more than just employee and employer they seem like friends to each other FeelsStrongMan.
87,"Jan 12, 2022",Secretive Plotter is probably drinking all of this up
87,"Jan 12, 2022","I can't stop laughing at this chapter. The Dokkaebi might be the puppet masters in this case, but Dokja keeps hitting them where they don't expect it😂. Kinda makes me think of the Pinocchio song ""There are no strings on me."""
87,"Jan 12, 2022","Law of Plausibility: existsDokja: catwalks the line with sass
"
87,"Jan 12, 2022",even his chin had abs.
87,"Jan 12, 2022",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' is glad that  the dokkaebi 'bihyung' is back.][The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' is proud to announce that it will still subscribe to this channel.] [5 coins have been sponsored. ]
87,"Jan 12, 2022",Dude is playing 5d chess while everyone else is still learning to play checkers
87,"Jan 12, 2022",Bihyeong is when a mafia grunt  becomes a mafia boss
87,"Jan 12, 2022",Dokja is what we call a professional scammer because Him and Biheyong bout to become the greatest of all time.
87,"Jan 12, 2022","oh, Prisoner of the Golden Headband, Demonic Judge of Fire, Abyssal Black Flame Dragon, Secretive Plotter, you all look GORGEOUS!"
87,"Jan 12, 2022",The way we all went from hating this little monster to being invested in and loving him is kinda crazy. It's wild how people can just look past the genocide and stuff he's caused. I'm right there with em all though. 
87,"Jan 12, 2022",Pretty sure Bihyeong was more scared at the thought of being betrayed by Dokja than by being punished by the system. He looked so sad there for a while.
87,"Jan 12, 2022","Ok so Dokja didn't grief Dokgak's channel, he just straight up bamboozled him across time and space"
87,"Jan 12, 2022","I've played a lot of games where being able to talk your way out of anything is important, but I have never seen such a beautiful use of words in my life."
87,"Jan 12, 2022",This episode was Dokja pretty much just saying lmao no
87,"Jan 12, 2022",Watching him get flung into the stars was very satisfying
87,"Jan 12, 2022",Puppy eyes bihyeong literally 🥺
87,"Jan 12, 2022",Good good this is what Bihyeong deserves 🥰
87,"Jan 12, 2022","I do like the face reveals of the four major constalations. That's pretty much how I've imagined them, but I feel like secretive plotter might be a certain someone's constalation. "
87,"Jan 12, 2022",I knew I could trust Dokja to be a smartass.. I love him so much
87,"Jan 12, 2022",*YEET!*
87,"Jan 12, 2022",Bihyeong just said f*ck it im pissed off
87,"Jan 12, 2022",Hey there Buffyeong…
87,"Jan 12, 2022","I was about to say that Bihyeong is cute here but then he transformed so nvm. But really, why is he cute? 😂"
87,"Jan 12, 2022",That was satisfieng ＼(￣▽￣)／
87,"Jan 12, 2022","[Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" claps in appreciation as Bihyeong punches out his competition for trying to steal our MC, also our Dokkaebi has some muscle 💪]"
87,"Jan 12, 2022","Dokja be like: ""Leave a like and smash that subscribe button, new videos everyday!"""
87,"Jan 12, 2022","Dokja has got to be the most brilliant idiot of all time. Between the Constellations, the Dokkaebi and Jungheok, this man is playing with all the fire. "
87,"Feb 2, 2022","I love how the constellations are all like, ""Why are all these constellations joining, ugh."""
87,"Jan 14, 2022",Anyone: I'm gonna force Dokja to do what I want...... what is this feeling of imminent financial destruction?
87,"Feb 16, 2022","The [Naval Warfare God] (Jihye's supporting constellation) is wary of the constellations from the Tokyo dome, because he was a Korean soldier who fought against the Japanese. The more you know 🌠"
87,"Jan 12, 2022","I love that Dokja shows his appreciation for his associates by stealing others’ business for them. I know Bihyeong already appreciates Dokja because he has seen what he is capable of, but he definitely was scared that Dokja would leave him high and dry."
87,"Feb 9, 2022",dokja top tier mate. This man has swindled countless people and is still going. Le Master Con Man
87,"Jan 14, 2022",Dokja had nothing but his wits and turned that whole situation around on that mf. He's a very impressive MC. 
87,"Feb 16, 2022","""This is my real voice"" Everyone READING this: 😑"
87,"Feb 10, 2022","Ah, this episode was satisfying. Dokkaehi's mistake: Dokja Kim is not an employee; he is the boss. He doesn't waste time proving his innocence, he promotes HIS channel.  He empowers his employee, Bihyeong, to take out the trash."
87,"Jan 12, 2022",This chapter was satisfying on so many levels
87,"Jan 15, 2022",Just another episode of Dokja eating the rich.
87,"Jan 12, 2022",the catharsis in this episode is palpable
87,"Feb 16, 2022",02/15 Today is Kim Dokja’s birthday!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY 🎁🎂🎉 
87,"Jan 12, 2022","Chad Bihyeong dosen’t exist, he can’t hurt you
Chad Bihyeong:"
87,"Jan 16, 2022","The constellation, Secretive Plotter, is probably loving every minute of this."
87,"Jan 12, 2022","Dokja looking at how far he got flung and thinking ""I REALLY hope he doesn't decide to change our deal"""
87,"Feb 16, 2022",his face in that one stream footage panel 😭 💀 
87,"Feb 16, 2022",Everyone @ Bihyeong at the start of the series: This little bitch! vs. Everyone @ Bihyeong now: YASSS SLAY KING
87,"Feb 10, 2022",This is one of the most greatest WEBTOON novels I have ever read I swear bro this is just the best literally legendary
87,"Feb 6, 2022","This ch made me laugh so much, I love dokja and how he's like: let me sign up the contract and you link your channel to bihyeong, you give us constellation, you give up coins and get ✨ absolutely nothing ✨"
87,"Feb 16, 2022","""He sure is high maintenance"" hahahahaha and Bihyeong in the background like 😐"
87,"Feb 16, 2022",I think that the perfect constellation for Dokja is Secretive Plotter lmao
87,"Feb 16, 2022","Jung Huiwon: You killed her! //Han Sooyoung: Actually I believe she died of natural causes //
Huiwon, checking the body: Knife to the neck //
Yoo Sangah: I thought you said she died of natural causes?! //
Kim Dokja: There is nothing more natural than dying from a knife to the neck //
Sooyoung, nodding: What would be unnatural is if she survived"
87,"Feb 16, 2022","Lol, Dokja's face in those last three panels hahahaha I love you, you smart motherfucker"
87,"Feb 16, 2022","it is late, but.. Happy Birthday Dokja! stay awesome!"
87,"Jan 12, 2022","""You won't get away with this"" bruh, he gonna live stream that thunder punch"
87,"Feb 16, 2022",Bihyeong gave the Dokja smile 😂
87,"Jan 12, 2022",birdsong grew a six pack on his chin
87,"Jan 12, 2022",Dokja you are such a smart special boi. I’m glad you did not abandon Bihyeong
87,"Feb 18, 2022","I still can't get over the fact that they really gave secretive plotter those fabulous long nails and uriel's serious face, but Kim dokja looking at the universe really make me want to cry for obvious reason. damn you kdj (affectionate)."
87,"Feb 16, 2022",Dokja is promoting himself like nothing is happening 😇
87,"Feb 16, 2022",HAPPY BDAY DOKJA
87,"Feb 16, 2022",SORRY BUT BIHYEONG'S SAD FACE IS SO CUTE
87,"Feb 16, 2022",🤣🤣🤣🤣 This man is a true scammer
87,"Feb 16, 2022",That was sooooo satisfying 🤣
87,"Feb 16, 2022",Dojka stay loyal to his boi Bihyeong✊
87,"Feb 16, 2022","Trade offer:I get, everything and anything you own
You get:
Punched in the face"
87,"Jan 15, 2022",THE WHITE COAT
87,"Jan 12, 2022",That's ending was fucking hilarious
87,"Jan 12, 2022","bihyeong  looked so pitiful when he thought dokja would leave him he was so sad!! but that power up and smart move move from dokja, love it."
87,"Feb 16, 2022",You are special. You are loved.
87,"Feb 16, 2022",i just want a dokkaebi plushie☹️☹️☹️
87,"Feb 16, 2022","Ah kim dokja at it again🤣.. kinda knew he had something up his sleeves, just feels satisfying to see it all played out. 😋😋😤🥂"
87,"Feb 9, 2022","Bihyeong be like... ""ONE PUUUNNNCCHHHH!!"""
87,"Feb 7, 2022",The RELIEF I felt when dokja helped him😭
87,"Jan 13, 2022",This must have been the worst trade deal in the history of trade deals. Love it. Dokja living the dream. 
87,"Feb 21, 2022",Is that the Definition of a “cosmic bitch slap”
87,"Feb 21, 2022", I'm so happy that Dokja didn't break his promise to bihyeong and instead just gave him a huge boost towards his goal it makes my respect for him grow even more😁✌
87,"Feb 17, 2022",happy day late birthday dokja 🥲
87,"Feb 16, 2022","happy belated birthday to dokja ^^, and also AWWW BIHYEONG EVOLVED LOL hes so floofy"
87,"Feb 16, 2022",Dokja and the youtube advertisements.
87,"Feb 16, 2022","Yes, bihyeong and dokja 🛐🛐🛐"
87,"Feb 16, 2022","I liked how the 4 are showing up being him - secretive plotter, the abyssal black dragon, uriel and prisoner of the golden headband"
87,"Feb 16, 2022",Waiting for that Coat
87,"Feb 16, 2022","I don't know about you, but instead of hearing an imaginary ""pow"" or ""crack"" when Bihyeong punch to the red Dokkaebi, I hear a ""poof"", kinda like the one of the dog toys that squeak. P.S: I can't with the millions of pieces of fur are floating around after the mega punch of shredded Bihyeong 🤣👊💪"
87,"Feb 16, 2022","Secretive plotter has very long nails.. and arms. Edit: Wait maybe that is persephone...Uriel monkey king, and psycho dragon.... "
87,"Feb 16, 2022","However, Dokja is still under Bihyeong’s contract, and wasn’t it that, if he breaks the contract of selecting a constellation to partner with, that he will die? What loophole is Dokja going to leap through to get out of selecting a constellation? Why did Dokja deliberately specify (AND reiterated twice) 10,000 subscribers, and not more or less? Do smaller channels have a capacity limit or something like that?"
87,"Feb 16, 2022",HAPPY BIRTHDAY DOKJA
87,"Feb 16, 2022",KIM DOKJAS BIRTHDAY 
87,"Feb 16, 2022",You can never scam a scammer… should never have given him access to chat until he signed a contract.
87,"Feb 16, 2022",happy bday to our star!! 💫❤️
87,"Feb 16, 2022",happy birthday Kim Dokja❤️
87,"Feb 16, 2022",happy birthday to our beloved reader dokja 🤍🤍🤍
87,"Jan 26, 2022",Ngl Bihyeong crying it was a critical hit to my heart and it was so satisfying to see him get angry at the hand. I got very attached to this little murderous fella
87,"Jan 21, 2022",They are so evil but also adorable! 
87,"Jan 20, 2022",secretive plotter has really nice nails 💅
87,"Jan 14, 2022","oh wow, I LOVE the panel with all the constellations looking at him 🤩"
87,"Jan 12, 2022",Ah just love it!!!!! Dokja is a freakin chess master! Out hear playing around with the other Dokeba! I  can’t wait for what’s to come next! Dokja surely knows how to set the stage for us Constellations! 🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙💰💰
87,"Jan 30, 2022",Dokja just exists to test people's blood pressure and Bihyeong knee this. But he knows Dokja is the loyal type too.
87,"Feb 21, 2022",7 FUCKING DAYS STILL WHY DOES THIS GET ME SO HEATED. CHAAANNGGE CHAAANNNGGE JUST CHAAAANNGGGEEE

87,"Feb 16, 2022",is there baby bihyeong plushies? i want one 
87,"Feb 16, 2022",All hail bihyeong 
87,"Feb 16, 2022","but since he's already in contract with Bihyeoung, he can't form a contract with a constellation right? wasn't that one of the terms? I bet he'll get out of it by saying the winner has been notified so as not to say no one won 😂"
87,"Feb 16, 2022","😂if only the company he worked for ""minosoft"" recognized his talent "
87,"Feb 16, 2022","YEAHHHH THE BIG 4 MAIN SUPPORTERS THE GREAT SAGE, HEAVEN’s EQUAL, ABYSSAL BLACK FLAME DRAGON, URIEL, AND SUGA- SECRETIVE PLOTTER"
87,"Feb 16, 2022",Happy birthday Dokja! We hope you are no longer alone. 
87,"Feb 16, 2022",IS THAT MY PRECIOUS URIEL I SEE 🥺🥺🥺
87,"Feb 9, 2022","Well, a dokkaebi is a dokkaebi but Kim Dokja is KIM DOKJA."
87,"Feb 9, 2022",This was worth the time debt
87,"Feb 9, 2022",i purchased coins just to read the the next chapters and it is all worth it 🤣🤍
87,"Feb 7, 2022",The constellation addicted reader is pleased by the incarnation’s plan.
87,"Jan 17, 2022",😂 bihyeong got abs on his chin when he was putting the red dokkabi in his place. If subscribers could give youtubers powers pewdiepie would be unstoppable.
87,"Jan 12, 2022","So Bihyeong literally went “United States of SMASH!” And yokes a fool to the 5th dimensions, huh…? Good for him! Proud of you, baby! Toss a (few dozen) coin(s) at your Incarnation Friend!"
87,"Jan 12, 2022",Im… so.. proud of u my boy… single manly tear from Ron Swanson has been shed today. 
87,"Oct 11, 2022",Bihyeong is literally like “look at me. I’m the boss now”
87,"Jul 3, 2022",so no one's gonna talk about how cute bihyeong is??
87,"Jun 9, 2022",You can tell the good writing when the author gets you rooting for the villain. 
87,"Apr 28, 2022",bihyeong is so adorable
87,"Apr 22, 2022",i feel like were the constellations right now...
87,"Apr 6, 2022",We love scamming scammers
87,"Mar 25, 2022","I'm so glad dokja didn't betray bihyeong. no matter how many terrible things bihyeong has done, he's starting to grow on me. they don't seem like just employer and employee anymore "
87,"Feb 24, 2022","Bihyeong is so cute and full of stupidity on one side, but so scary and devilish in the other... I vote cute."
87,"Feb 22, 2022","My God. This webtoon just got even more fun and interesting. I want to see even more battles between Dokkaebis. But, which constellation will Dokja choose? He promised the constellations that he'll choose one so he'll need to fulfill that, but then once he chooses, many constellations will leave Bihyeong's channel because they were on it only to get Dokja as an incarnation. Unless Dokja can do something to make them stay regardless, will things be solved."
87,"Feb 20, 2022",I JUST CANT GET ENOUGH THIS WEBTOON IS SO FREAKING GOOF ISTGSGJSKSJDJDNDNSJDHBDNSN *dies*

87,"Feb 17, 2022",Bihyeong please punch me. Be sure to punch me hard enough so i could reach seoul
87,"Feb 17, 2022","So far, Dokja had Bihyeong's cooperation. Now, he has Bihyeong's loyalty."
87,"Feb 17, 2022",dokja has balls man and i mean ehem dokja died and came back from the death so hes like jesus i dont think you can kill him 
87,"Feb 17, 2022","Is Dokja finally getting his constellation?! 😃
(Violates the contract)"
87,"Feb 17, 2022","BELATED HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DOKJA-YA!!!<3333"
87,"Feb 17, 2022","Has Dokja even eaten one meal, much less three per day? or gotten any sleep?"
87,"Feb 17, 2022","Before I disappear again uh chapter 95 bad news. The translation's not out yet, but a post was saying that they cut off Gilyoung's comment...."
87,"Feb 17, 2022",bihyeong made me sad when his bawling his eyes out🥺
87,"Feb 17, 2022",Dokja is the only scammer we're fond of. 👏👏👏

Han Sooyoung: *takes a breath* //
Han Sooyoung: You’re BRILLIANT."
87,"Feb 16, 2022","I wanna read the novel but have put it off for so long because looking forward to this in the middle of the week, every week is such a pleasure. Always feels like things are getting crazy, then get even crazier. It's been such a fun adventure, and its only getting better."
87,"Feb 16, 2022",I am here for I am the everlasting law.
87,"Feb 16, 2022",Bihyeong is gonna be a little pissed with Dokja! Thankfully he will forgive him since things turned out better than ever!
87,"Feb 16, 2022",So here's a fun thought: It's impossible for Dokajin to kill a Dokkaebei here ... but what about another Dokkabaei?
87,"Feb 16, 2022",I so enjoyed this episode! 😂🤣
87,"Feb 16, 2022","Damn Bihyeong, I didn't know you were that strong HAHAHAHA"
87,"Feb 16, 2022","THANK YOU BIHYEONG, YOU ABSOLUTE LEGEND! DOKJA YOU SMART AS HECC MAN! YOU BOTH WON IN THIS SITUATION >:D"

87,"Feb 16, 2022","also, Bihyung needs to up his caveman look. Tho I like his cuddly ferral caveman monster fluff look. "
87,"Feb 16, 2022","That was some absolutely expert level scamming. If all the bots in the comment section were that clever, I might not want to hunt down the person responsible and make an example of them."
87,"Feb 16, 2022","Me: *ignoring my responsibilities* | Also me knowing there will be consequences: ""Who cares"" *slaps it away*"
87,"Feb 16, 2022",DOKJA'S BIRTHDAY WAS FEB 15TH. EVERYONE WISH HIM AND JIHYE A HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY. Jihye's birthday was feb 14th. uh Keep in mind that Sooyoung's is April 1st!

87,"Feb 16, 2022",If he does actually end up choosing a constellation I hope he picks Prisoner of the Golden Headband. However I don't really see him picking a constellation plus even if he did it likely would be one of the others.
87,"Feb 16, 2022",biyeong's muscles though
87,"Feb 16, 2022","WTF. URIEL. YOU LOOK LIKE ""I'LL PAY YOU 100,000 COINS TO MAKE A JOONGDOK DJ"""

87,"Feb 15, 2022","happy birthday, kim dokja my beloved!!"
87,"Feb 9, 2022","Dokja literally said ""I don't like this scenario, let me just tweak it"" 🤣🤣"
87,"Jan 27, 2022",Dokja in that last frame enjoying this too much lol
87,"Jan 19, 2022",I knew it!! Dokja just YouTube subscribe to my boy Bihyeong channel and he got JACKED 😂😂💀… and didn’t his contract with Bihyeong say he couldn’t have a supporting Constellation
87,"Jan 12, 2022",Bihyeong really went from this ಥ_ಥ to this 💪👹👹 
87,"Jan 12, 2022",BIYHEONG.....SMASH!!!!!
87,"Jan 12, 2022",Welcome back everyone!!!
87,"Oct 5, 2022",WHEN WILL THEY SELL A BIHYEONG PLUSHY!?!?!?
87,"Jun 26, 2022","i was re-reading the chapters and noticed something important here! the constellations that Dokja mentioned to move to the other channel are the same for ones that have accompanied him since the beginning! he mentioned Sun Wukong, Uriel, the Abyss Dragon, but right before he was mentioning secretive plotter he was interrupted. that means that Dokkebi might know who he is and chances are he is most certainly a Big Shot!
(not to mention he is perfect for Dokja since he always plotting something!)"
87,"Jun 7, 2022","This is what I like about ORV, its not predictable like most stories, we all know that dokja is always gonna win ofc, he's our MC, but the way the story shows how he does it, the process and all is so good. Idk if it makes sense, but it uses the world building and so much aspects of the story to Dokja's advantage yet manage to not make the story confusing or too much. Many applauses and compliments to the author (and to the artist for the beautiful illustrations), this is a beyond amazing story"
87,"Jun 6, 2022","I gotta say, I absolutely love the slow, natural progression of their relationship. "
87,"May 22, 2022",PETITION TO MASS PRODUCE BIHYEONG PLUSHIEEEEES
87,"May 14, 2022",When I start rooting for Bihyeong hoo boy was I smiling ear to ear lol. Dokja and Bihyeong are gonna be making even more bank because of this event. I'm so proud of these two lol
87,"Apr 26, 2022",One doesn't deal with Kim Dojka...one survives him 😭😭
87,"Apr 23, 2022",prisoner of the golden headband is gatekeeping Bihyeongs channel
87,"Feb 15, 2022","happy birthday, kim dokja my beloved!!"

87,"Jan 12, 2022",BIYHEONG.....SMASH!!!!!
87,"Jan 12, 2022",Welcome back everyone!!!
87,"Oct 5, 2022",WHEN WILL THEY SELL A BIHYEONG PLUSHY!?!?!?
87,"Jun 26, 2022","i was re-reading the chapters and noticed something important here! the constellations that Dokja mentioned to move to the other channel are the same for ones that have accompanied him since the beginning! he mentioned Sun Wukong, Uriel, the Abyss Dragon, but right before he was mentioning secretive plotter he was interrupted. that means that Dokkebi might know who he is and chances are he is most certainly a Big Shot!
(not to mention he is perfect for Dokja since he always plotting something!)"
87,"Jun 7, 2022","This is what I like about ORV, its not predictable like most stories, we all know that dokja is always gonna win ofc, he's our MC, but the way the story shows how he does it, the process and all is so good. Idk if it makes sense, but it uses the world building and so much aspects of the story to Dokja's advantage yet manage to not make the story confusing or too much. Many applauses and compliments to the author (and to the artist for the beautiful illustrations), this is a beyond amazing story"
87,"Jun 6, 2022","I gotta say, I absolutely love the slow, natural progression of their relationship. "
87,"May 22, 2022",PETITION TO MASS PRODUCE BIHYEONG PLUSHIEEEEES

87,"Feb 18, 2022","Damn but he's going to have to choose a constellation then at the end of the day. I can't wait to see who he chooses. I'm hoping it's one of the constellations that's been in the channel since the start, just a little loyalty to the ones that's been gifting him all along ya know"
87,"Feb 18, 2022",lmao Dokja really be out there scamming dokkaebis LOOOL

87,"Feb 16, 2022",I guess I worried for nothing I'm glad Bihyeong is back and now he's even stronger just another step closer to being the Dokkaebi King I hope? also Dokja is such a troll if I remember correctly he can't be sponsored by a constellation because of his contract lol imagine how angry the constellations will be when they find out

87,"Feb 16, 2022","I think Bihyeong can get away with punching the guy by saying he was just stopping him from breaking the rules of plausability(which in a way, he was). And so glad Dokja did not sign a contract with this very sketchy Dokkaebbi, knew he would not go along with such a over-confident prick"

87,"Feb 17, 2022",Time for a theory we haven’t seen anyone from Eden myth yet so what if Three ways to survive in the apocalypse is the Bible and Dokja is acting as Moses to “write” the a new interaction of it… also wouldn’t that make jonghyuk Jesus…
87,"Feb 17, 2022","[the god of ships is dancing and calling out how he was an ""OG"" of bihyeongs channel since day one] "

87,"Feb 17, 2022","Buff Bihyeong is whoopin’ some ass also I get the feeling that Prisoner of the Golden Headband/Sun Wukong or Demonic Judge of Fire/Uriel might be the only Constellations Dokja would ever partner up with, Sun Wukong would be more sagely and offer him actual advice at times and not treat him like a dog/pet like Abyssal Black Flame Dragon would — Along with, I think Uriel would most likely treat Dokja very well along with, she is his fangirl of sorts already"

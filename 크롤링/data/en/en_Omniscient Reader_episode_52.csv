Episode,Date,Review
52,"Apr 28, 2021",That was not a very good kinder surprise egg
52,"Apr 28, 2021",It's kinda like hop scotch but with your life on the line
52,"Apr 28, 2021",Alright guys which of the moron prophets we betting is gonna die?
52,"Apr 28, 2021",Am I the only that really misses Dokja’s regular face? It’s bizarre seeing his Ken doll impression haha 
52,"Apr 28, 2021",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' is complaining about the difficulty of this scenario and demand star stream to adjust it.][The constellation 'LazyBrokeWeeb' is currently uncomfortable with the appearance of a disaster.][The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' is currently praying for their safety.][5 coins have been sponsored.]
52,"Apr 28, 2021","Dokja:""Run clockwise"" imagine if someone got it mixed up and just got burned to ash😂"
52,"Apr 28, 2021","Lol the meeting was like a TWSA convention & Dokja had the best cosplay. Ignir's design looks great (sucks to be that guy who got his face obliterated)! Also, that mid-level dokkaebi looks like he can be related to Asriel or something. He looks dapper in that lil suit & tie"
52,"Apr 28, 2021",“Some of you have supporting constellations so I can’t let you die...”  I only really care about 3 characters in this scenario 
52,"Apr 28, 2021","Dokja must have one hell of a body to pull off Junghyuk's face 😳
The fact I find Dokja more attractive than Jonghyuk makes me wonder why they think Dokja is ugly LOL Don't draw Dokja so FINE for the webnovel if that's how it's gonna be 😤"
52,"Apr 28, 2021",he's gonna risk his life to let them all take shelter AGAIN. and fight A FREAKING DRAGON
52,"Apr 28, 2021","Dragon was like ""surprise mf"""
52,"Apr 29, 2021","Knowing Dokja, he's gonna let the other 4 stay in the box while he himself finds a way to survive outside of it lol. He's done similar things like 4 times already because he's too nice, or gets special items from the challenge of it lol."
52,"Apr 28, 2021","Me, just waiting for Dokja to claim this unclaimed station as his 10th and complete the Kings Path"
52,"Apr 28, 2021","I think I liked ""Disaster"" rather than ""Catastrophe"" - dis + aster = literally a ""bad star"", and since it came from a shooting star..... "
52,"Apr 28, 2021","we don't like to call them meteors, we prefer to call them surprise mechanics "
52,"Apr 28, 2021",what if dokja finished the apocalypse and was able to become a constellation. then he used his phone to publish a story that his past self could read to make him ready for the events to come and that's why the publisher said I can publish my story. that would mean that it was all one big plan so that he could eventually become a constellation.
52,"Apr 28, 2021",Which of the five will take the safe plate? Who will sacrifice themselves? Find out on next time of dragon ball- omniscient reader!
52,"May 22, 2021",ayo dokja don't even think about doing the daily ritual of self sacrificing urself👮‍♀️✋🏻
52,"Jun 16, 2021",it’s too weird seeing multiple expressions on YJH’s face
52,"Apr 28, 2021",Hopscotch but the consequence is death
52,"May 3, 2021","Dokja is like a sad guy saying ""I could never be a protagonist"". Then go ahead sacrificing himself to save others. I doubt that he will enter the safe zone and let someone else outside."
52,"Apr 29, 2021",this may be one of the best webtoons I've ever read
52,"Apr 28, 2021","Read this way too quickly, looks like it's back to another week of waiting. At least UNordinary releases tommorow as well."
52,"Apr 28, 2021",Am I the only one who prefer dokja before the mask thing? He was way more handsome before 💔
52,"Apr 28, 2021","Man the 4 of them are about to look at that guy like ""Welp, see ya in the next life."" XD"
52,"Jun 16, 2021","anyone else afraid to stop reading, just in case we get sucked intro a TWSA scenario ourselves?"
52,"May 1, 2021","This is so fantastic I read all 51 in 2 days.  This is the most excited I've been every single episode.  Awesome job to illustrators and 10/10 all around.  So excited, to read what comes next!"
52,"Apr 28, 2021","Omg the art of this episode is mind blowing. I adore the design of the dragon, it’s beautiful and so cool! Thank you author for an amazing story!!"
52,"Apr 28, 2021",whooo id say things are starting to... HEAT up... okay ill leave now
52,"Apr 28, 2021",Well new guy ain’t getting on 🤣
52,"Apr 30, 2021",there's a part of the novel that can't be quite conveyed in the webtoon and that part is.... the amount of simping and fanboying KDJ actually does over YJH
52,"May 12, 2021","Now we have officially passed episode 50, we have become disciples, ladies, and gentlemen "
52,"Jun 16, 2021","weekly dokja's- er,, junghyeok's? lashes appreciation comment....."
52,"Jun 16, 2021","Seriously the ""PROTAGONIST"" face is hot and all but i miss ""OUR PROTAGONIST"" face 😔 "

52,"May 4, 2021",can this be made into an anime yet?!?!?! like I just read the whole thing just today and I'm so excited for the rest!!
52,"Jun 19, 2021",i respect the choices of the translation team bc they’ve been doing a great job but it’s really kinda upsetting that in the webtoon it was translated as “catastrophe” instead of disaster. not just bc i took the [SPOILER ALERT] “every human is a disaster for each other” [SPOILER ALERT] quote as a life motto but the etymology of ‘disaster’ is “without a star”and one of the main plots is having a supporting CONSTELLATION
52,"Jun 17, 2021","Dude, Dokja actually downgraded when he wore that mask. Dokja over Jonghyuk any day any time 😌🤚"
52,"Jun 16, 2021",I suggest you guys read the novel it’s good
52,"Jun 10, 2021","did i just, for the first time in my life, spent my money on a app..? what have i done, how do i stop now? i want to read the next one as well..."
52,"Jun 20, 2021",It's sad to see the likes going down. Come on guys!! Please don't forget to like a chapter at least. Even a like matters so much to the author!!!
52,"Jun 20, 2021",Am I the only one who actually thinks Dokja looks better than Junghyeok? 😅

52,"Jun 16, 2021",ALRIGHT EVERYONE! WE ARE ALL NOW OFFICIALLY DISCIPLES!!!
52,"Jun 16, 2021","I don’t know why I found using a “th” instead of a “rd” for “763th” so funny, my sense of humour is broken."
52,"Jun 17, 2021",A hardcore game of musical chairs. 
52,"Jun 16, 2021",for all I know Dokja is gonna risk his life 
52,"Jun 16, 2021","'UNITED WE FALL, DIVIDED WE FALL'- me and the boys: ""Well boys, seems just about us."""
52,"Jun 16, 2021",yo this is bad junghyeok's face in dokja's body is growing onto me he doesn't look as weird anymore 
52,"Jun 12, 2021","If you would ask me, is not like a farmer's market, it's more like a Comic-con!! 🤣"

52,"Jun 16, 2021",....is dokja gonna be the one not entering it again like the safe zone episode
52,"Apr 29, 2021","Honestly I love this story but part of me is reading this just in case ya know... if the story goes for 10 years and all of a sudden this novel predicts the apocalypse. In all seriousness I love how this novel changes up the power fantasy narrative, making a protagonist who uses his prior knowledge to manipulate situations for his benefit, while still being not too strong that it is unreasonable "
52,"Apr 29, 2021",started reading this late last night and now I'm caught up and don't know what to do with myself..

52,"Jun 16, 2021",my sense of direction is so messed up that when he said clockwise i read counterclockwise 🥶🥶
52,"Jun 16, 2021",dokja:run clockwiseif i was there i could have run the other way i not good with directions
52,"Jun 16, 2021",no but that mid level dokkaebi is so cute?? is the bureau just a build-a-bear factory??
52,"Jun 16, 2021",I LOVE THIS WEBTOON.
52,"May 25, 2021",How am I suppose to hate this particular dokkaebi when he is this cute???!!!
52,"Apr 28, 2021",I started this Webtoon because of a contest to get 5 coins. I have just spent the 5 coins I got on this same webtoon. I’ve sunk so many coins into this webtoon that I may as well be a sponsor. Ride on my Incarnations. Master is pleased.

52,"Oct 24, 2021",it's funny how people are so arrogant after reading less than 50 chapters of book that contains more than 3000 chapters.
52,"Aug 3, 2021",me wondering that why all the people who read twsa's first few chapters are middle aged...then I realized that dokja had been reading twsa for fvking 10 years 🤣🤣
52,"Jul 1, 2021",firstly everyone started blushing when they saw dokja's fake junghyeok and that was funny buuut a solution to their current problem is rock paper scissors
52,"Jun 29, 2021",Idk why but I found it funny when Dokja went into a defensive stance when people started crowding around him
52,"Jun 22, 2021",Tbh if I was Dokja I'd have alrdy forgotten everything there goes my life's opportunities
52,"Jun 21, 2021","to use coins, or to not use coins?"

52,"Jun 18, 2021",Ah I can't wait for kdj to finally get a headstart on his favourite hobby 💕
52,"Jun 17, 2021",...wasn't it called disaster in the novel? I mean I guess it doesn't really matter since they're pretty much the same thing...
52,"Jun 17, 2021",we just gonna ignore the fact this dude just said 763TH💀
52,"Jun 17, 2021",That dokkaebi fancy
52,"Jun 17, 2021",Why do I have a very bad feeling that Dokja will be the one who doesn’t stand on it? (From a storytelling pov it feels the most likely rn but I don’t like it)
52,"Jun 17, 2021",almost had a stroke trying to read 763TH
52,"Jun 17, 2021",all genders and sexualities agree: yu junghyeok is hot af
52,"Jun 16, 2021",I would like to know what the original twas was like to read. These people are idiots to think this wouldn't be a good story. Plus if I was a lower renounced I wouldn't believe everything someone said as I would think they are going to screw me over in the end.
52,"Jun 16, 2021",Ok but like I feel bad for the dragon who had to lay that egg. That thing looks rocky asf
52,"Jun 16, 2021",lol i miss dokja’s real face xd
52,"Jun 16, 2021",so Dokja is gonna let them stand in the square obvs
52,"Jun 16, 2021","Someone wanted to kill Jonghyuk and all the  Prophets as well. I don't understand why though, killing the main character will lead to a disaster since noone else could end this apocalypse. Except the person who plotted this, wants to replace the main character or doesn't want this apocalypse to end. According to this theory, this person needs to know how the story will develop or needs to have access to the story. So this person definitely is a prophet."
52,"Jun 16, 2021","just wonderin what the author is doing??👀is he secretive plotter¿,....anyway,bt if dokja is gonna save them,and fight the dragon,the mask gonna melt ,(ik he isn't gonna die here)and gonna reveal his true identity.Then the other so-called prophets is gonna know he is also a prophet (whatever they call) who has read over 50 ..no no no "
52,"Jun 16, 2021",Ahhh yes hello early people who are to broke for fast passes

52,"Jun 16, 2021","Man, there really a lot of them.<prophets>"
52,"Jun 16, 2021",I'm gonna bet Dokja will most likely to be out of the box..literally
52,"Jun 16, 2021",At least he doesn't have to wipe them out himself
52,"Jun 16, 2021",how can this readers be so DUMB like that no one ever thought about the consequences of knowing the future and messing with it???

52,"Apr 29, 2021",these cliff-hangers!!! i still get frustrated even after reading the novel!
52,"Apr 29, 2021",Sense when did Dokja become a murderer? Why would he want to wipe out the prophets instead of trying to make friends with some of them? None of them have really read past chapter 50 so they aren't much of a threat. Dokja is looking a little different in this chapter. More chiseled in the face ✨
52,"Apr 28, 2021","I'm not gonna lie, I thought the author was gonna write him/herself into a situation where they just had too many allies. A story with too many super powerful people who all know the future being on the main characters side would make the story a bit...lack luster if not anything else, loving the way this is being dealt with."

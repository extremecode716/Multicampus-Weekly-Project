Episode,Date,Review
33,"Dec 16, 2020",So that Gilyeong kid has so much potential that Jonghyuk thinks Dokja is lucky to have him? Interesting lol. Also the fact that he got rejected by the kid in the face xD. Good job kid.
33,"Dec 16, 2020",I can't believe Gilyeong is wanted by Jungeok Yu which means he's insanely powerful as well as THE FACT THAT GILYEONG REJECTED THAT MAN AND WENT STRAIGHT TO DOJKA IS ADORABLE!!!!!!
33,"Dec 16, 2020",so did Dokja's mother kill his father or something and he ended up seeing? also I remember him thinking 'is mother alright? she is mother after all' so she must have no problem killing. Good in this situation (he said in the sea monster) Edit: üö®I DO NOT RECOMMEND LOOKING IN THE REPLIES PEOPLE PUT SPOILERSüö® 
33,"Dec 16, 2020",it makes sense the kid is sought after. you all acting like he didn't connect with an insect that was the size of a building above ground from the subway 
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Dokja the reader vs anna Croft the prophet vs junghyeok the gamer???? I'm hyped for the future ‚ù§
33,"Dec 16, 2020","Dokja feels like the misterious character in many stories that make random appearances, and we later find out that he has some crazy back story that's hard for the main characters to believe, but it's only revealed towards the end of the story."
33,"Dec 16, 2020","I'm not the only one who noticed Anna Croft lvl up her ""Mental Barrier"" by while talking to Dokja, right? "
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Ah‚Ä¶ eng release doesnt give us the sweetness of gilyeong crying out ‚Äúhyung‚Äù when he sees dokja awake. We get the first glimpse into dokjas past‚Ä¶ very important. 
33,"Dec 16, 2020","Yjh: Okay, Gilyeong. Choose, Mommy or Daddy? Gilyeong *no hesitation whatsoever*: Mommy!"
33,"Dec 16, 2020","When the two protags seem to be at each other‚Äôs throats, there‚Äôs an important question to ask... which one had the stronger plot armor? ü§î lolz"
33,"Dec 16, 2020","So I'm not the only one thats hoping this gets animated one day, right?"
33,"Dec 16, 2020","Junghyeok: Join me and you can be strong! Gilyeong: Not leaving my big brother! 
[You have been gifted 5 coins] "
33,"Dec 16, 2020",When I heard Anna Croft I was like aawwwww snap we a got a tomb raider in OR and then I was like ......nvm that‚Äôs Lara Croft 
33,"Dec 16, 2020","I need to re-read this again. Seriously how much do you plan? Also when gilyeong hugged him, my heart melted."
33,"Dec 17, 2020",Did anybody noticed that Dokja did not actually fulfill the ‚Äúclear conditions‚Äù? He survived the scenario but did not occupy a green zone...
33,"Feb 3, 2021","gilyoung/gilyeong calls kim dokja ""hyung/hyeong"" not ""dokja"" and that woman in dokja's backstory calls him ""dokja-yah*"" not ""dokja"". (*-yah - suffix used with close friends or family members as a sign of affection) and lastly, sangah, hyunsung/hyeonseong, heewon/huiwon call dokja ""dokja-ssi*"" not ""dokja"" and vice versa with kim dokja; he also calls them in first name basis but with a '-ssi*' at the end. (*-ssi - literally means mr./ms; used as a polite way to call someone‚Äîcoworker, etc.) 1/2"
33,"Dec 16, 2020",OH! BEFORE I FORGOT PHYSICAL COPIES OF THIS WEBTOON IS NOW AVAILABLE TO PRE ORDER!!! If you guys are interested please to check it out!! its available in 2 vols with 9 chapters each.
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Anna Croft is probably so confused of my boy Dokja 
33,"Dec 16, 2020",[The constellations of the Webtoon nebula are interested in Dokja‚Äôs past and are looking forward to seeing more! 100 coins have been sponsored.]
33,"Dec 16, 2020",I don‚Äôt care about most of the translation (like how the names are written etc.) but I really want Gilyeong to call Dojka ‚ÄûHyung‚Äú!!! Whyyyyüò≠
33,"Feb 3, 2021",I'm sorry but could the translators use the korean honorifics?? i think it would add more emotions and shows their relationship development (the closer you are to a person you can speak casually seen from the honorifics)
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Gilyeong rejecting Junghyeok for Dokja was *chefs kiss* so satisfying 
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Finally we get to have a little insight into Dokja's past! Seems he went through serious trauma üòî that's probably why he connects so well with Gilyeong
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Dokja's teammates are so wholesome.
33,"Feb 3, 2021",this is the first time he has actually slept since the novel STARTED!
33,"Dec 16, 2020",I wish I was a prophet...so that I can read the rest of this series!!! üòÇ
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Dokja pulled a pro gamer move and used the rare item from the last Level
33,"Dec 16, 2020",ready player three: anna croft
33,"Jan 28, 2021",Can‚Äôt believe it took an apocalypse for Kim Dokja to literally adopt a son üòî
33,"Dec 17, 2020","Croft realized Dokja wasn't Junghyeok because she said he looked Korean, so Junghyeok isn't Korean? "
33,"Dec 16, 2020",As we can see the famous last words of an protagonist .... I will not die I am Legend.... then dies... that‚Äôs a big Oof-epic theme song at the end 
33,"Jan 28, 2021"," ""I need to think but I'm too tired."" Same Dokja, same."
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Damn, the constellations in Anna Crofts channel must of gone insane with excitement as soon as Dokja appeared. WHO'S THAT MAN?? WHAT CHANNEL, WHAT STREAM?? "
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Y‚Äôall are in for a surprise and a long ride considering this story has over 550 chapters and some of the characters go through major body changes. Honestly I ship you know who and Dokja, I‚Äôve already read a majority of this so know what‚Äôs going on but honestly it‚Äôs worth the wait."
33,"Dec 16, 2020","[The Constellation of Solo Leveling] insists that the readers ""SHUT UP AND WAIT"""
33,"Feb 3, 2021",I'm sure Jonghyuk is making a mental note of where Gilyoung  was in the train so he could pick him up next regression.
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Awww little Gilyeong had tears in his eyes when he found out Dokja woke up! And that hug! ahh I love the relationship they have! I hope they stay really close. (Because they will NOT die.)
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Become a ghost they said. You wont feel a thing they . . . Life trauma . . . FFFFFFFUCK!!!!
33,"Dec 16, 2020",I‚Äôm looking forward to Gilyoung‚Äôs growth in abilities considering Jonghyuk saw his potential and tried to recruit him.
33,"Dec 16, 2020",I swear that little kid is slowly becoming more and more badass 
33,"Jan 26, 2021","huh? that skill that detected Dokja's lies is not ""mental barrier"". It should be ""Lie Detection"" skill like in the novel. Mental barrier and Lie Detection are different. PLS FIX THAT. They're not the same skill. Pls people, tell the translators to fix that."
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Dokja: I'm somewhat of a prophet myself.
33,"Feb 3, 2021","I still cant believe that the fourth wall is a skill, usually it would be for humor but it‚Äôs really what keeps this story alive "
33,"Dec 16, 2020","Haha Yjh trying to get our gilyoung? Sorry not sorry but its not that easy, bro .. gilyoung is belong to his father üòÇ"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",oof when you trying not to be the main character makes you the main character
33,"Dec 20, 2020",Favorite WEBTOON by far unordinary don‚Äôt got nothing on this
33,"Feb 3, 2021","I wanna point out that Anna Croft didn't use Mental Barrier lv 7 to detect Dokja lying. That was actually Lie Detection lv 7.I know some people may have pointed this out before me, but I wanna add in since this needs to be noticed.
(Such a shame the trabslation doesnt say ""Wait for me across the continent"" or something around those lines, which kinda hints on where she's from. But maybe its obvs from her name and all)"
33,"Jan 27, 2021","ngl boy has excellent photogenic memory, I wish I had that, he can remember every precise little thing from the novel while I can't even remember what'd I study 15 mins ago.. üò∂"
33,"Dec 16, 2020","Hypothesis: there is always a non-evil way to survive.  In the first scenario, in addition to insects, it was possible to kill skin mites, for example."
33,"Feb 3, 2021",i forgot we know sh*t about his past
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Gilyeong doesn't give two fcks about anyone but Kim Dokja. My favourite child. Also Yoo Jonghyuk looking good as ever üò≥
33,"Feb 3, 2021",i dont even know why we were worried. I mean Dokja legit has sum S rank plot armor like-
33,"Dec 16, 2020","So, hypothetically, can Gilyeong level up his Bug Collector ability enough to control that Monarch Praying Mantis we saw earlier?"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",By far one of the best webcomics üëç 
33,"Dec 17, 2020",Gilyeong probably never made any of the scenarios since Dokja is why he survived the train so I bet his hidden talent is extremely important. I wonder if it's related to him controlling the boss-sized bugs outside?
33,"Feb 3, 2021",dokja is so cool
33,"Feb 4, 2021",It‚Äôs funny how the in universe ‚Äúbook‚Äù is called ‚Äúways of survival‚Äù and Dokja is using this book to find ‚Äúways to survive‚Äù.
33,"Feb 4, 2021","It's nice to read the comics along with the novel. The comics remind me of stuff that I would otherwise have forgotten. That said, Anna Croft used Lie Detection, not Mental Barrier, so there's a bit of an error here. "
33,"Dec 16, 2020",[The constellations of the Webtoon nebula are satisfied with the coins spent and are looking forward to seeing more! 100 coins have been sponsored.]
33,"Feb 7, 2021","so like i decided to read the novel so i could be ahead and o boi i got to ch 300 smth in 3 days. ITS SO FREAKING GOOD. and now im reading it not just to be ahead, but bc of the story in general and im just quietly tryna b patient while waiting for some of my fav scenes to be drawn cuz WOW. 11/10 would def recommend the novel guys. check it out if u want and dont forget to heart the ep!‚ù§Ô∏è"
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Okay so fangirl moment Anna is now aware of his existence and realizes he was never meant to be because he is in none of her past/present/future visions or memories. Can you understand the anomaly that she must be facing at this moment, that something had slipped past her all seeing gaze and it‚Äôs a gosh darn fanfic reader......I personally am screaming inside because this could be me one day üòÇ"
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Here‚Äôs my quick theory...I think Gilyeong is a regressor. This is the only reason why they are talking about who completed what in a sense. I don‚Äôt think anything else makes sense to why Jungeok Yu would want him on his team. Just a little theory I hope I‚Äôm right it would be really cool! 
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Can we have a moment to appreciate Gilyeong. This boy cares for Dokja so much that he rejected the offer and ran into his arms the minute he saw him wake up. This boy is a fricking cinnamon rollüñêü•∫‚ú®
33,"Feb 10, 2021",Dokja and Gilyeong's father and son relationship is one of the best things in this series
33,"Feb 4, 2021",me: pff what do you mean I have a favorite? I love each and every ORV character equally. || also me: *sets reminder for dokja's birthday and his birthday only* (ITS ON FEB 15 BTWWW AKA THIS MONT H)
33,"Feb 4, 2021",‚ÄúDamn trauma‚Äù I think we all feel this way.
33,"Feb 4, 2021","if This kid dies, I'll riot"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",I understand why Gilyeong wants to stay wirh Dokja. He treats him well and take care.
33,"Jan 27, 2021","The best part is Gilyeong rejecting Jungeok Yu right to his face and running to Dokja afterwards!!! Good job, kid!! Lol üòÜüòÇüòÜ"
33,"Feb 6, 2021",Aww I think Gilyeong thinks of Dokja as a father! And he ran straight to him after rejecting The original mc.
33,"Feb 4, 2021","Anna Croft doesn‚Äôt use mental barrier to check if Dokja was telling the truth, she used lie detection üò© Please fix this! "
33,"Feb 3, 2021",i went back to read the prologue... Dokja was so cute while reading TWSA... 
33,"Jan 30, 2021","So Jonghyuk take slot in the greenzone on purpose, borrow the monster's hand to kill Dokja and take Gilyeong under his wings, at first I thought he just being an asshole. Well, Dokja, I guest it would be plans to kill you, again."
33,"Dec 16, 2020","...I just keep using coins on this series. haha. 

where can I read the web novel? 

"
33,"Feb 5, 2021",THE WAY GILYEONG RAN UP TO DOKJA ü•∫
33,"Feb 4, 2021",yu junghyeok really has the nerves to try scouting gilyeong after he left hIS HYUNG TO DIE??????
33,"Feb 4, 2021",Wow... his memories were more traumatic then I thought they were going to be. I guess that's why he's a loner who read his entire life. Why is he doubting not being a main character with that kind of background though?
33,"Feb 4, 2021",‚ÄúI need to think...but I‚Äôm too tired‚Äù Lmao even tho this is an extreme situation that‚Äôs a total MOOD (Ôæâ‡≤•Áõä‡≤•)Ôæâ
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Y'ALL GILYEONG'S LOYALTY TO DOKJA AND HIS REACTION WHEN HE FINALLY WOKE UP IS SO FREAKING ADORABLE. PROTECT GILYEONG AT ALL COST ‚úäüò≠
33,"Feb 3, 2021",bruh this Jungeok whatever needs to stay away from  Gilyeong üòÄüòÄ
33,"Jan 14, 2021","*Horde of monsters shows up* Dokja: ""Yeah, I'm gonna sit this one out."" *Slides into another dimension* "
33,"Dec 16, 2020",Damn trauma... Always getting in the way. 
33,"Feb 5, 2021",Dokja protec dokja attac dokja‚Äôs adopted son has his back
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Awww, Gilyeong is so cute and he chose Dokja over the obvious choice, Jongeok. Now I have to wait for the next episode since I'm broke. Patiently waiting for 6 days, 11 hours, and 59 minutes. >_<"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",gilyeong is so precious and i feel like he‚Äôs gonna grow to be really strong too. dokja was right in choosing to help the kid ü•∫
33,"Feb 4, 2021",Bad translation... She uses is Lie Detection to tell he is lying NOT Mental Barrier. Why would a skill that blocks mental attacks/prying detect a lie?!?!?!  I cringed reading that. Otherwise great chapter.
33,"Dec 17, 2020","Me everytime a new episode comes out: ""Shut up and take my money!"""
33,"Feb 6, 2021","I‚Äôve refused to read this comic for months SPECIFICALLY so I would have some sweet content to binge read. 
This has been one of the best stories I‚Äôve read on WEBTOON yet!"
33,"Feb 5, 2021",THE WAY DOKJA WAVED AT THE BLONDE GIRL DKLJAWFKJWEJA I'M RUNNING LAPS üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
33,"Feb 5, 2021",Gilyeong's relationship with Dojka is just beyond precious ‚ù§Ô∏è
33,"Feb 4, 2021",ü§∫Away you heathenü§∫ Step away from my childü§∫
33,"Feb 4, 2021",this webtoon is too good y'all
33,"Feb 4, 2021","Ummmmm btw Anna Croft used lie detection to detect Dokja was lying, not mental barrier, mental barrier is a skill to block people from entering your mind or reading your stats, etc., not to detect lies"
33,"Feb 4, 2021","Jonghyuk: ""Come with me Kid...you are the chosen one.""Gilyeong: ""P*ss off.""
Dokja: ""That's ma BOI!"""
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Gilyeong used tackle! It was affective!
33,"Feb 3, 2021",I honestly love reading mostly romance but this series gets me hooked on a whole different level.  I love how intricate it is and the level headed actions of the main character makes it so much more mysterious 
33,"Feb 3, 2021",I LOVE GILYEONG SO MUCHHHHHHH HES SO CUTE AND PRECIOUS I WILL PROTECT HIM AT ALL COSTS 
33,"Jan 27, 2021","Dokja simply wasn't made to be a protagonist. He was kinda forced into the position ngl. He's the strategic guy that plans and organizes and is a decent leader, but if he teamed up with Junghyeok... They would bring the world to it's knees."
33,"May 10, 2021",aw you can see sparkles in gilyeong's eyes when he saw that dokja was awake ü•∫ü•∫
33,"May 8, 2021",I knew it!! He WAS looking at Gilyeong! maybe because he can somehow control those large monsters above ground or another power/skill they need to survive a difficult scenario?? The suspense is intense!!!
33,"Apr 29, 2021",Junghyeok wanted Gilyeong because of his potential but Dokja just wanted to keep him safe with him ü•∫ And the way Gilyeong run towards him is just too precious??!!! ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
33,"Feb 9, 2021","Gilyeong is the cherry on top for this story, hope he doesn't die because if he did, I'll only be happy if the author did what tswa where it resets"
33,"Feb 9, 2021",Technically he is a TYPE of prophet 
33,"Feb 8, 2021",Gilyeong seeing dokja as a dad is cute
33,"Feb 4, 2021",He may be insanely powerful but he's still a kid needs a family to rely on. Dokja is a great example of an older brother sort of like Itachi Uchiha. 
33,"Feb 4, 2021",Ahhh when Gilyeong chose Dokja over Jonghyuk that gave me such a large amount of pleasure just cause it shows Jonghyuk not everyone wants you and also how much Gilyeong is attached to Dokja
33,"Feb 3, 2021","I read and finished the translated webnovel a while back and let me say that it is a masterpiece. Even knowing what's coming next, I still enjoy seeing the story come to life!"
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Oh so Junghyeok sees Gilyeong's potential, which is why he agreed to save him and even took the initiative to do so. But Gilyeong's a loyal lil bean. I love him"
33,"Feb 3, 2021","I must admit, I imagined Anna Croft different. Gilyeong is loyal to dokja uwu "
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Junghyeok said to Gilyeong when did you complete. I wonder if that means that Gilyeong is actually one of the characters in the original story that got scrapped as a side character but because of Dokja he is now one of the mains and he is on his 2nd or higher run of it
33,"Feb 3, 2021",""" I NEED... TO THINK.... BUT I'M TOO....TIRED""THAT'S ME EVERYDAY!!!!!"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",lmao ig Dokja won the custody battle BAHAHAHHA
33,"Feb 3, 2021",such a DAD Im crying
33,"Jan 28, 2021",Jonghyuk and Dokja's relationship is so passive aggressive  heavy emphasis on aggressive. I kind of love it.
33,"Jan 28, 2021",i use the coin to pass the cliffhanger but now I'm struck with another one- .... i- whyyy
33,"Jul 22, 2021","As I‚Äôve said, Gilyeong and Dokja are father and son"
33,"May 6, 2021",A kid rejected your proposal just like that!?Junghyeok you might be the protagonist of TWSA but honey you ain't no protagonist of Omniscient Reader.
33,"Apr 29, 2021",I. love. gilyeong.
33,"Apr 29, 2021",This constellation is happy to have a sneaky peeky in your past
33,"Feb 6, 2021","Everyone is about the translation, the plot armor and Gilyeong but what about the ART! I hate to say it, but Anna Croft looks incredible. When I read the webnovel, my mental character design of her was a bit older. Seeing her though, she gives a youthful, hip vibe that's reminiscent of older fashion. I see those shredded pant cuffs on her jeans. Her level of detail is just amazing. "
33,"Feb 5, 2021",I love how dokja is like a dad to gilyeong
33,"Feb 4, 2021",I've read a lot of webcomics on here but this is the first one that made me spend tokens. I know this is going to be a great just like Tower of God!
33,"Feb 4, 2021",PROTECC GILYOUNG WITH ALL MY HEART!!! 
33,"Feb 3, 2021",My last comment (I‚Äôm not gonna die F****** DIES) apparently that was correct he turned into a ghost *pushes glasses up nose* my hypothesis is correct 
33,"Feb 3, 2021",The girl is like in Tokyo Ghoul his eye like Ghouls
33,"Jan 27, 2021","I‚Äôm with Gilyeong‚Äîwhen it comes to Dokja, I‚Äôm not going anywhere. "

And Yoo Junghyeok covered it up with some sort of a skill and survived, but he was roasted alive when Gilyeong rejected him and ran straight to Dokja. *Pulls out ice pack* ""Apply to burnt areas""."

33,"Feb 6, 2021",Gilyeong and dokja‚Äôs relationship is so adorable Dokja should adopt him lol üòÇü•∫
33,"Feb 6, 2021",Anna Croft looks exactly like I thought she would!! Also Dokja looking pretty cool in that one scene lol
33,"Feb 6, 2021","The Jonghyuk bastard is so insensitive and inappropriate. Gilyeong is alive and has discovered his potential through Dokja. Dokja isn't just ""Lucky to have him"". Dokja is the reason the kid survived, else he would have died in train itself. Dokja is the root of the great potential harbored by Gilyeong. If it were upto Jonghyuk, Gilyeong and the others would die, the only surviver would be the military guy."

33,"Feb 5, 2021","A really good adaptation, but the sadness when your mental image doesn't match up with the artist. üòû I love the interactions, Anna Croft just doesn't look like how I imagined. Still a really great job with the webtoon, I love reading it every week!"
33,"Feb 4, 2021","I'm curious about Gilyeong past. About his parents, and why he's not even trying to look for them."
33,"Feb 3, 2021","In the novel Dokja woke up on Sangah's lap this chapter, it seems they changed it to her folded jacket in the webtoon for some reason"
33,"Feb 3, 2021",so like am i the only person who has to wait because they are poor?
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Considering that Gilyeong could already communicate with Extremely strong monsters at the beginning while his skill is still really low level just shows that he'll eventually become strong enough to probably control every insect boss or maybe even other non-insect creatures. Perhaps he even has better skills that we know nothing about
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Gilyeong and Dokja are so cute
33,"Feb 3, 2021",its my birthday and i wake up to a new comic from my favorout series instantly made my day 
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Gilyeong running to Dokja and hugging him like that is one of my favourite things of all time. Also why does seeing Dokja with a child make him seem more attractive than he already is? It‚Äôs not fair 
33,"Feb 3, 2021",If I ate that rock I'd have probably died immediately
33,"Feb 3, 2021","Okay, I'm kinda gay for Anna Croft. She's a looks a lot different than I was expecting because when I read the novel they made it seem that she was pretty young looking, but it is a welcome suprise."
33,"Feb 3, 2021",It's too strange to return to webtoon after having read the novel. I see the hole story with different eyes. (ToT)
33,"Feb 3, 2021",I think Anna‚Äôs skill is supposed to be ‚ÄúLie detection‚Äù not ‚Äúmental barrier‚Äù
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Dokja's face when lying to a prophet LOL.
33,"Feb 3, 2021",So Gil is super strong that he's even wanted by Yunghyeok
33,"Feb 3, 2021",Here I am thinking that Anna Croft was a loli or some short character. She a fudging supermodel!

33,"Jul 2, 2021","He did totally try to adopt the kid, jokes on you Dokja adopted him first. Also...ooo that memory, dead person and a woman standing over the corpse with light brown hair...wonder who that is. Clearly, he knows them but jeez, that's crazy that he encountered that before getting the scenario to actually happen to him. Also Anna Croft got the eye Dokja traded for and she's an actual prophet, so that's very interesting."
33,"Jun 17, 2021",BROTHERS. they are BROTHERS. this is canon idcidc
33,"Jun 15, 2021",dokja is so lucky that gilyeong had that container of bugs TT
33,"Jun 4, 2021",Gilyeong i think is also someone that completed a run and when back to relive it as in his conversation with the other guy he asked gil when did he complete possibly meaning the runa and something about before possibly meaning a previous run then we get so blurry speaking
33,"May 5, 2021",I love how the kid loves Dokja

33,"Feb 11, 2021",gilyeong is so attached to dokja that he even turned a offer to become stronger with a god like person
33,"Feb 9, 2021",I‚Äôm thinking Gilyeong is important bec he can control monsters idk
33,"Feb 9, 2021",I'm honestly still not sure if junghyuk is surprised by his sponsor or his stigma...

33,"Feb 5, 2021",If only this was uploaded daily T-T 
33,"Feb 5, 2021","I suspect it may not necessarily be how strong Gilyeong is so much as planning for any potential confrontation with Dokja. Or both, I mean, Gilyeong did summon that giant bug early on. Either way, these chapters are feeling so short now, I can‚Äôt get enough, I need my fix!"

If everyone leaves this work and even if it runs for 10 years, I would be the only one person to read this. Also I draw the attention of the anime industry. If this becomes an anime, I would crush the anime industey if the art quality is even a pinch little worse than this one.Thanks to the author and artists.Stay safe."

33,"Feb 3, 2021",Gilyeong rejecting Jonghyuk reminds me of Jiwoo rejecting the principle in Elecced

33,"Feb 3, 2021","Damn, Dokja had all this planned from day 1? This man really is OP. Also, for those who think he should have felt more trauma after being turned into a ghost, remember that the 4th wall skill keeps him calm 24/7"

33,"Feb 3, 2021",Ah that was awesome! I definitely didn't expect Anna to pop up and Gilyeong rejecting Junghyeok was awesome and adorable. I wonder what Junghyeok's planning. Man this is good!
33,"Jan 29, 2021",who wouldnt choose dokja i mean he gives hugs and headpats üôÑ‚ùóbut than again he couldve had the choice to travel with levi ackerman üòî

33,"Jan 28, 2021","Gilyeong is so adorable, I'm guessing that despite being a cute lil kid though, he may be a regressive himself. It's either that or he has a super powerful constellation or some kind of ability backing him. Super excited to see where he goes."

33,"Jan 27, 2021","okay so gilyeong obviously has some secret power that makes jonghyuk want to take him away from dokja, but if you think about gilyeong wasn't supposed to survive... he's only alive now because dokja saved him on the subway üëÄ"

33,"Dec 16, 2020",Interesting that the prophet thought she was looking at the protagonist at first. lends a bit more weight to my theory that the protagonist and Dojka might actually be the same person in different realities. 
33,"May 20, 2021","What if Gilyoung is also a regressor who originally wrote the novel along his journeys so humanity can survive? Then he finally met Dokja who had interest on his work and hid his identity, that's why he was attached and chose to stay with him. The fact that, he can also control an insect monarch, ackk, oh well, just a theory."
33,"May 8, 2021",I have a theory Dokja is the main character and not YJH because the god like dudes are interested in him and not YJH and when he went in the dream the lady said she was expecting YJH and he‚Äôs the main character which makes me think she was expecting the main character and dokja appeared so he might be the main character

33,"Feb 5, 2021","ok so here's my theory, a couple chapters ago, gilyeong was able to summon monsters 20 times bigger then him to where he was. I think he has the potential to be able to control most if not all monsters in the series. This power mightve also been foreshadowed during chapter 1-3 when gilyeong had a box full of insects. "
33,"Feb 5, 2021","Take a rest, Dokja."
33,"Feb 5, 2021",i love the kiddo so muuuuch

33,"Feb 3, 2021",OH MY GOD I CAN‚ÄôT WAIT TO SEE GILYEONG GROW TO BE THE GREATEST. HE IS SUCH A SWEET BEAUTIFUL BOUNCY BABY BOY RIGHT NOW.

33,"Jan 27, 2021",I am pretty damn sure that Gilyeong might be one of the regressors like Jonghyuk. Readon I think this is because of them talking about ‚Äúcompletions‚Äù (meaning if they have survived and won the whole apocalypse thing and don‚Äôt have to keep going back and redoing it) in there conversation 
33,"Jan 20, 2021","Damn I ran out of coins. Gonna have to sell my clothes, cuz I can't stop reading this "

33,"Dec 18, 2020",he needs Dokja to make gilhyeong strong enough tho. otherwise he's useless. Dokja doesn't want Gilhyeong to die cuz of moral reasons. but him keeping gilyeong alive is the only reason jung hasn't killed him üòÇü§£

33,"Apr 27, 2021",Gilyeong is a person of interest for sure; he could summon that gigantic preying mantis.
33,"Apr 27, 2021","I had a hunch... when they defeated that demon servant, Gilyeong tried to find bug to take them back and accidentally called the bug insects monster above ground... That Fabre of his is powerful. No wonder Junhyeok wants him."
33,"Apr 16, 2021",omg dokja is dad materialüòÑüòÇ
33,"Apr 16, 2021",Anna croft bro üò≥ you too op man shoo

33,"Apr 4, 2021",I knew Gilyeong was gonna be great
33,"Mar 18, 2021",Anna Croft well the art of her was great but in the novel she hotter in there üòÇ

33,"Mar 11, 2021",I love his skill of leaving an impression on people 
33,"Mar 11, 2021","Small typo after dokja says he is a prophet as well, the skill anna uses is lie detection not mental barrier"
33,"Mar 11, 2021","Looks like there was an error during translation process.The list of Anna Croft's personal skill is missing ""Lie Detection Lv.7"" (Should be placed between Mental Barrier Lv.6 and Arch-Demon's Gaze Lv.1)
Also, the skill she used to see through Dokja's lie (claiming to be a prophet himself) should be ""Lie Detection Lv.7,"" not ""Mental Barrier Lv.7"""

33,"Dec 16, 2020","When your about to die, and almost forgot about the life saving ghost crystals lol, did I ever doubt Dokja, only a little when it first said he was a ghost.And then we meet, the Prophet Anna Croft"
33,"Dec 16, 2020",When Dokja met Anna he was literally looking in the yes of an devil lol but thank god he's alive... AGAIN. Its just melts my heart to see how Gilyoueng cares so much for Dokja i mean the way he rejected Junghyeok was priceless! lol
33,"Dec 16, 2020","Dang this man, plotted from the start! Amazing "
33,"Feb 15, 2021","Gilyeong is my favorite character, I don't care how badass Dokja is, it will never beat pure adorableness."
33,"Feb 3, 2021",again...the second skill Anna used that detected Dokja's lies is NOT MENTAL BARRIER. It should be LIE DETECTION skill. I hope they fix this..but i guess they won't -_-
33,"Feb 3, 2021",haha Dokja has mommy and daddy issues wait this sounds mean I'm sorry Dokja
33,"Jan 27, 2021","so he said im ep 31 that TWSA goes bad because of the MC, Maybe the Novel happened in an alternate world and the author is a constellation or a God that wishes him to Fix it.

33,"Aug 27, 2021","Looks like Dokja's mother was a victim of abuse who turned on her abuser. It would explain why he speaks so fondly of her. 4th wall is OP. Not only can it block mental attacks, it can also stop people from viewing his stats or having his future peered into. He is the author of his own destiny and as such can probably change the future. Gilyeong is a beast in the making. Goes to show everyone has potential and Junghyeok shouldn't toss people aside so casually"
33,"Aug 24, 2021","I think the readon Gil has developed so much is because he was with Dokja or else it would have been the military dude becuse if Dokja wasn't there, he would have gone with Jung and then he would have become better and also I think, outlr Dokha is turning into the protagonist, slowly because and maybe Anna Croft was trying to contact yhe person who will end this and it contacted Dokja???

33,"Oct 8, 2022",I'm curious about Dikja'e past now & also what Gilyoung's power is. Just how strong Is the Lil kiddo? Dokja's colleague (forgot her name) is also a mysterious character.
33,"Oct 8, 2022",That moment was so cool! When she was so desperate to know the answer but vanished hahaha! You cool bastard Dokja!
33,"Oct 8, 2022",Wohw! this The Fourth Wall thingy is cooler than i expected!!! I wanna know what exactly it does though. My guess is that he has that skill cuz he's the Omniscient Reader. He has the advantage of knowing everything (or a lot of things) beforehand & that's why he has the skill The Fourth Wall (that's one cool name too)
33,"Oct 7, 2022","gilyeong ofc would follow his father figure dokja, junghyeok bich u thought."

33,"Sep 15, 2022",Based on the bit of the conversation we picked up on. I'm guessing that Gilyeong is also a regressor like JHY
33,"Sep 8, 2022","also, I just realized that anna was able to see him because of her clearvoyance skill. I just didn't know how far clearvoyance can see people, so she has to be near by right ?"

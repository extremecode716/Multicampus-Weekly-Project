68,"Sep 1, 2021",take a shot everytime 4th wall skill cockbl0ck us from seeing dokja's past
68,"Sep 1, 2021",sending an employee back to their workplace after they've left for the day..... that's one nasty dokkaebi
68,"Sep 1, 2021","So the plagarist is still alive.. And not gonna lie, they are looking good. 👌 
edit: Not in a creepy way! But you have to admit that she is drawn beautifully."
68,"Sep 1, 2021","violence is never the answer in these situations. it's the question, and the answer is yes."
68,"Sep 1, 2021","Every time I open the comment box of ORV: spoilers, Lazy Broken Weeb, Neptune's, constellation like comments etc,etc. Really... ORV'S comment box is my favourite now"
68,"Sep 1, 2021",When even system admits it’s a filler
68,"Sep 1, 2021",Lazy Broke Weeb i hope you’re okay
68,"Sep 1, 2021","The art is always amazing, but this episode is top notch. I'm grateful to the artist because this series is amazing and they're doing an incredible job bringing it to life like this. "
68,"Oct 6, 2021","It's the fact that this chapter was so much darker in the novel, I don't know whether to say it's a good or bad thing that they can't show some of those aspects"
68,"Sep 1, 2021","Show the author some love everybody! This series is absolutely amazing, blows me away every single week!"
68,"Sep 1, 2021","Out of all the flavors you could have picked, you had to be salty"
68,"Sep 1, 2021",This gives me more anxiety than the main scenerios 😱
68,"Sep 1, 2021",Suyeong Han is one of my favorite characters for this story! I love her character arc and her snappy personality so much and I’m excited to see her in the comic!!
68,"Sep 1, 2021",Dokja's mother is the real mystery here
68,"Sep 1, 2021",I'm pretty sure we're all constellations in some universe.

68,"Sep 30, 2021",Me seeing the new girl: 👀 kinda looks like that fierce short haired girl from squid game. 
68,"Sep 1, 2021",Just Waiting for Lazy Broke Weeb to comment 🥺
68,"Oct 6, 2021","This scene felt a lot more gruesome, disgusting and deplorable in the novel, you guys should go check it out"
68,"Oct 6, 2021",In novel this chapter are very cruel especially on sex slave rape scene. I doubt manhwa can draw that as it is censored.
68,"Sep 30, 2021",Damn I really did not expect Han Suyeong to be this gorgeous in the webtoon. 
68,"Oct 6, 2021","I think they should have kept the mentions of rape shows in this part. It didn't need to be gratuitous, but it was obviously something it was bad that certain constellations enjoyed, and it made these characters more villainous than typical kill-or-be-killed types. Also, I wonder if there's a minimum calorie amount and time in between for something to be considered a meal? "
68,"Oct 7, 2021","I hate this mid level dokkaebi, i want bihyeong back "
68,"Oct 6, 2021","Lol, does Jihye have that bump cuz she asked Junghyeok about the ""love letter""?"
68,"Sep 1, 2021",seongguk worrying abt gilyeong.. i'm liking this guy way too much
68,"Oct 6, 2021",Theory: twsa was actually written by Dokja from the future
68,"Nov 8, 2021",i want the old dokkaebi back 😡
68,"Oct 7, 2021",This coin farm was a hell of a lot more graphic in the web novel. And I don’t think I need to explain what happened to certain women to get my point across
68,"Oct 6, 2021"," ""Sorry that must've been uncomfortable for you""            Literally a guy that started chaos minutes ago"
68,"Oct 6, 2021","The coin farm is much darker in the LN (r*pe scene, and etc.) They really tone it down here in webtoon."
68,"Nov 12, 2021",Wth I miss old dokkaebi I hate this one he is too evil
68,"Nov 8, 2021",find it kinda interesting how the comments and likes are decreasing as the story goes on just like it is describedd
68,"Sep 3, 2021",ngl  this should really become a Netflix original 
68,"Oct 7, 2021","Dokja by himself is a coin farm, he’s pointing and laughing at these guys who think they’re a money making genius 😭"
68,"Oct 6, 2021","I love that the sub scenario is essentially, ""you must eat and sleep adequately - and pay your bills!"" 😂"
68,"Oct 6, 2021","Man this scenario seems tough, I haven’t had three meals a day and six hours of sleep a night for many years, then pile on the whole apocalypse thing..."
68,"Oct 6, 2021",all that bloodshed just for 1 tiny cereal bar O M G.... pls if I'm ever in the end of the world i better be in Dokja's group 👀👀👀👀
68,"Oct 6, 2021",Dokja lookin real fine this episode 😳

68,"Sep 1, 2021","Huiwon as barman?, im- The girls of this mahnwa fjsnjxn(ˊ • ͈ ꇴ • ͈ˋ)♡?! [The most anscient simp blushes]. Dokja kick the ass of that shit!!! [5 coins have been sponsonred]"
68,"Oct 6, 2021",Man suyeong is so beautiful 🤒🤒
68,"Oct 6, 2021",When I started watching Squid Game I immediately thought of Omniscient Reader.. 👀 
68,"Oct 6, 2021","if you think this is a masterpiece yall, i 100% recommend you to read the light novel. i guarantee you'll never regret it"
68,"Sep 2, 2021","The plagerist is sooo pretty. I know it's not a romance, but I wonder if Dokja finds her attractive? "
68,"Sep 1, 2021",They’re lucky they haven’t caught huiwon yet. Her judge of evil ability (I know that’s not right someone please correct me) would activate in here Fs 
68,"Oct 27, 2021","yall the lump in my throat when it said rooftop what do you mean it was just a hang out spot, damn dont angst bait me like that jajajajaja"
68,"Oct 6, 2021",Aww Sangah tried to help Junghyeok ^^
68,"Oct 6, 2021",that plagiarist is not as simple as you think 
68,"Oct 6, 2021",SHES SO HOT OKFFNGKFKD
68,"Oct 6, 2021","I honestly don't think there is a series out there that would be more deserving of an anime, this is truly an incredible comic"
68,"Nov 7, 2021",It's crazy how we know shit about Dokja's past we just know he was bullied and read a novel for 10 years 
68,"Oct 8, 2021","god tysm @ authors for partially censoring this part from the novel because I was really uncomfortable reading it then and seeing it in comic form would be horrifying 
uhhh unless they're gonna do that scene next ep because 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃"
68,"Oct 7, 2021",“Why does she have a bump on her head?” That was a really huge asssss bump 🤣💀👏🏻
68,"Oct 7, 2021","""take it easy"" YEAH SAY THAT TO SOMEONE WHO ISNT THE LORD OF SELF SACRIFICE LMAOO"
68,"Oct 7, 2021",I think it's even scarier that the humans are creating scenarios now
68,"Oct 7, 2021","I see they did a subtle critic to ""revenge stories"" and their apreciators, ppl are so hunger for them that swallow anything and it turned into a easy plot to profit, even if it was roughly done, just throw the bait of bully x poor guy and give powers to the poor guy. Some are even disgusting, as the readers enjoy even if the main character do horrible things without a single sign of blink."
68,"Oct 6, 2021",i miss the old dokkabei 
68,"Oct 6, 2021","I know she was bad, but, save her from those animals! "
68,"Oct 6, 2021",I know it's mostly for survival but this is disgusting. Sadly it's a common thing in apocalypse stories 
68,"Oct 6, 2021","I'm glad that that Dokkaebi will have to pay for his actions. Plus, his actions has brought in a nice twist and brought in some interesting stuff to the story. I really hope Dokja and the plagiarist bond well."
68,"Oct 6, 2021","Oh man, I forgot the coin farm was a thing. Both it and Mr. Yun go eat a pair of dirty, grimy, moldy, fungus-ridden crocs."
68,"Sep 29, 2021",Nice to see some of Dokja’s past... seems like his mother murdered a family member and hat resulted in bullying. I despise these coins farms... I’m thinking (and hoping) Dokja will put a stop to it to save the plagiarist cuz she seems like she may be useful (avatar skill for example)
68,"Sep 2, 2021",when you meant to fastpass one episode and then fastpass all of them
68,"Sep 1, 2021","TBH Suyeong Han and Huiwon are totes, the hottest characters! I wonder if Suyeong will gain an attraction to Dokja, because right now shipping Dokja with Huiwon feels right. But then again the plagiarist and The Omniscient Reader sounds intriguing?"
68,"Sep 30, 2021",Omg I remember this part in the novel but I think they might censor some parts damn anyway I can’t wait for dokja to save suyeong again also dokjas colleague is such a sick bastard like wtf is wrong with him
68,"Oct 10, 2021",I have a theory that the constellation “Secretive Plotter” is the author. I just have a feeling since the name seems related to like secretly plotting something like a story. Kim Dokja also didn’t even know who the constellation was.  You don’t have to believe what I’m saying but it’s just my theory.
68,"Oct 7, 2021","""she's quite a looker"" oh f*ck off you lowlife"
68,"Oct 7, 2021",Finally the phone dies
68,"Oct 6, 2021",dokja probably has 3x more coins than them
68,"Oct 6, 2021",i was wondering how tgey would handle this scene. in the comics there were public sexual asault cages and porn cages. 
68,"Oct 6, 2021",BUT WHAT ABOUT THE KID ????????? 
68,"Oct 6, 2021","Dokja's backstory is so intriguing...but I can tell that it's sad. Anyway, bet that man's gonna help Suyeong Han in another convoluted underhanded way....or she's going to fight first."
68,"Oct 6, 2021","You may have the last laugh Manager, but this is Dokja we are talking about here. What ever happens next will be something you’ll never see it coming that will make you faint and foaming on your mouth. Back to main subject, if there is vote in this chapter. I vote Dokja go Kenshiro attitude of killing this group of people who put victims in cages just for sake of fun and saving the girl of whose name title is “Copywriter.”"
68,"Oct 6, 2021",Sleep six hours a night. So many people would fail that probably due to reading WEBTOON through the night. 
68,"Oct 19, 2021",eat 3 meals a day and sleep 6 hours a night? guess I'm dead 💀
68,"Oct 13, 2021",mans just wanted to charge his phone cmon now
68,"Oct 10, 2021","Dokjas past is relatable, using stories as an escape.  The colosseum…how horrible"
68,"Oct 7, 2021","I see what they meant when they said Dokja isn’t particularly “good looking” now that I’m looking at the other unimportant characters, Dokja is a bit above average but he does have a forgettable face since he’s not particularly stunning. If Junghyeok is an 11/10, Dokja is a 6.7/10"
68,"Oct 6, 2021","3 meals a day, 6 hours of sleep? even I can't meet those conditions...."
68,"Oct 6, 2021",I miss Bihyeong
68,"Oct 6, 2021",she be looking cute tho👀💖😍
68,"Oct 6, 2021",Damn she's so pretty 
68,"Oct 6, 2021",When you just wanna charge your phone but then get caught up in a shitfest 😞
68,"Oct 6, 2021","they best not touch my wife, hsy"
68,"Oct 6, 2021",The squares around the title are fading... Does this mean something significant? Like the future of TWSA is fading because of Dokjas actions? 
68,"Oct 7, 2021",wheres lazy weeb
68,"Oct 7, 2021",not me wondering where is our [ Lazy Broke Weeb ]
68,"Oct 6, 2021",Thank god they didn't draw some of the other stuff that was happening in those cages in the novel
68,"Oct 15, 2021",I'm impressed a new constellation has gained more popularity than [Lazy Broke Weeb]
68,"Oct 15, 2021",He did all this naked… with only a robe on
68,"Oct 13, 2021",I see why Dokja hates being teleported back to Microsof- I mean Mino Soft. They're all mad
68,"Oct 12, 2021",Every so often I forget just *how* fucked up the world in this story has become.
68,"Oct 12, 2021",It's more and more interesting. I won't ever tired to read this story. This is my type. 
68,"Oct 11, 2021",I didn't take a good look at Suyeong Han in the earlier chapters. But god damn!!!! 😳😳😳😳
68,"Oct 10, 2021",AYO DOKJA BACKSTORY?? HELL YEAH
68,"Oct 7, 2021","ok ok ok, I don't like the plagiarist, BUT, damn, she hot"
68,"Oct 6, 2021",the dokkaebi just wants the players to take care of themselves duhh even tho it's gonna kill them after
68,"Oct 6, 2021",UGH OH NO I remember this from when I read the novel… it honestly scared me bc it feels too real compared to the other stuff ngl
68,"Oct 6, 2021",dokja read twsa to cope? he's just like me fr 
68,"Oct 6, 2021","this was the moment I said: well, shit. this story is darker than I thought. "
68,"Oct 6, 2021",I wonder... if he levels up that skill enough the fourth wall one would he be able to see us?
68,"Sep 1, 2021",And there goes my last 5 coins. Worth it! But now I am sad
68,"Sep 1, 2021",What do you want to bet that Dokja will bet on the plagiarists' life in an attempt to save her?
68,"Oct 7, 2021",I miss Lazy Broke Weeb😢 such a generous constellation 
68,"Sep 29, 2021","I'm terrified, even thought the series has shown worse things. Guess capitalism and it's horrors is the most terrifying thing existing."
68,"Nov 9, 2021",Am I the only one who wants all this wanderers dead)?
68,"Nov 6, 2021",damn im simping hard for suyeong lmao
68,"Oct 10, 2021","eat 3 meals a day, sleep 6 hours and pay a 500 coin fee?? I can't do that even now lol"
68,"Oct 7, 2021","i usually feel unsatisfied about adaptations in one way or the other but so far, i really loved reading the webtoon! the artist and narrator and the whole team did a great job in bringing out the best illustration of the novel one could hope for!"
68,"Oct 7, 2021",(CONSTELLATION LEMON IS NOT HAPPY THAT DOKJA COULDN'T FIND HIS CHARGER )(3 COINS HAVE BEEN SPONSERED FOR HIM TO BUY A NEW ONE )
68,"Oct 7, 2021","We didn’t see where Sangha, Gilyeong, and Junghyeok ended up after the teleportation…"
68,"Oct 6, 2021","I’m very glad this is a milder version of the novel(for webtoon only-s, in the novel it said that ppl were being s*xually assaulted and iirc they were talking like that about Han Sooyoung.)"
68,"Oct 6, 2021",Man I'm getting real squid game vibes...
68,"Oct 6, 2021","most uni students won't survive this sub scenario then, even without the apocalypse we barely have any sleep and broke af (or perhaps it's just me lol)"
68,"Oct 6, 2021",damn he still needs to load his phone though 👀
68,"Oct 6, 2021",cant wait for more han suyeong XD
68,"Oct 6, 2021",Of course Dokja was QA
68,"Oct 6, 2021",This chapter made me uncomfortable >w<
68,"Oct 6, 2021","[The constellation who judges stories enjoys the character development but is horrified by the ""coin farm.""]"
68,"Oct 6, 2021",thank you author sama you work so hard every week to give us this gem.
68,"Oct 6, 2021",I don't think dokja can even participate in this if he wants to keep the immortal king title
68,"Oct 6, 2021","Created a world without a king, so they were made to fend for themselves for a while without the aid of their groups. A narratively fitting 'punishment' I suppose. Wonder if Dokja will take control of this area now that he's here or what?"
68,"Oct 6, 2021","Ngl, I imagined Mr Yun and Dokja's bully quite different, aaaand we are at the coins farm... Full of awful people, can't wait for Dokja to crush their hopes and dreams "
68,"Sep 29, 2021",the coin farm and the people in charge kinda remind me of the scenarios and the dokkaebi tbh
68,"Sep 6, 2021",How many times have I gotten emotional reading this 
68,"Sep 1, 2021",Hiyahhhh I just spent money on coins for the first time because this series is just too good to wait for
68,"Sep 1, 2021",「The constellation lildickgirl_666 shows concern towards Lazy Broke Weeb. 5 coins have been sponsored. 」
68,"Oct 8, 2021","where is the constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb""???????"
68,"Nov 14, 2021",I think the plagiarist is an employee of the same company that Dojka works for.  
68,"Oct 23, 2021","when he transported to the rooftop, I thought it was a place where he tried suicide or seen it. Too bad, it was just mino soft "
68,"Oct 20, 2021","Oi, Huiwon is best girl, don't forget that. "
68,"Oct 16, 2021","This twist is interesting, I wonder what Dokja will do. Saving the plagiarist? End the ""fight club"" and take them under his wings? 🤔"
68,"Oct 15, 2021",3 meals every day AND 6+ hours of sleep every night? I don't think I could survive this scenario in a normal city let alone a ruined one.
68,"Oct 13, 2021",That girl looks like Fubuki from One Punch Man
68,"Oct 13, 2021","To be fair, coin farms are all the rage for players that can’t adventure on hard mode. "
68,"Oct 13, 2021","makes sense that there is a farm,seeing the condition of the world and innate nature of humans.."
68,"Oct 11, 2021",Can’t even lie…the Plagiarist kinda bad tho…👀😳
68,"Oct 7, 2021",i hate you dokkaebi 
68,"Oct 6, 2021","We stan a well-built, well-written world. The coin farms are such an interesting concept"
68,"Oct 6, 2021",Is the plagiarist going to get a redemption arc?I want dokja to save her and complete the filler tasks as a team
68,"Oct 6, 2021",the women is this webtoon are just so well written with complexity!!bonus: they looks good too
68,"Oct 6, 2021",I have a feeling our little plagiarist will join Dokja's party soon enough
68,"Oct 6, 2021",and now we truly begin
68,"Oct 6, 2021",Dokja is already scheming. Thinking of other shenanigans he can pull off and get eight other constellations to gift him a million coins. 
68,"Oct 6, 2021",ok but y'all are human trash.
68,"Oct 6, 2021",Save the Plagiarist! Save The Plagiarist
68,"Oct 6, 2021",Hes gonna save her. Callin it. Double down on that shi too💰💰

68,"Oct 6, 2021",That vengeance constellation is probably... Eula.
68,"Oct 6, 2021","I don't know why but when I was reading the novel I kind of expected all the characters to be wearing like the clothing from the place you know. So I was just waiting to see Huiwon in a bartender outfit idk. I had it all visualised with like a suit and everything. This makes more sense though, and the chapter's great!"

68,"Oct 6, 2021",Lazy broke weeb wya?😔
68,"Dec 29, 2021",that deokkaebi sure is salty
68,"Dec 16, 2021",I love how the story is progressing and how the author is taking everything into account... most of the things that literally would never cross anybody's mind.. they are all coming into view and I love the fact that they have also added emotions in it you know... positive as well as negative... it humanizes it all. the feeling of taking revenge... and all the moral ethics and all... I love it all

68,"Oct 15, 2021",Cheating little Dokkaebi is gonna get in trouble with the bureau… oh yes. His childhood bully. I always forget about him. This part of the sub-scenario was MOSTLY irrelevant

68,"Oct 11, 2021",every chapter have a lot of context it's so beautiful I won't ever get tired of rereading this until I die.👿❤
68,"Oct 11, 2021",damn why did the plagiarist have to be so damn cute even tho they acted like a ass they do be cute 
68,"Oct 11, 2021",aye
68,"Oct 11, 2021",i have an interesting idea: What if Secretive Plotter is Sangah's constellation? (I don't know if it is i have not read the novel) but hmmmmmm what if. Sangah's constellation didn't want the disclose who they were and she can't say who their constellation is (hence secretive). And Secretive Plotter gives Dokja a lot of coins because it's entertained AND it would make sense since it's incarnation is sided with him.
68,"Oct 9, 2021",My soul is ready.
68,"Oct 9, 2021","Holy crap this needs more views. Top notch story, art, plot development, the characters aren't stupid (too common for these types of series), and the author is actually creating a consistent world."
68,"Oct 7, 2021",mann its somewhat sad to see such a lack of novel readers here. orv is really underappreciated. 
68,"Oct 7, 2021",Destroy the coin farm!!!!
68,"Oct 7, 2021",SUYEONG YES
68,"Oct 7, 2021",I was honestly incredibly scared they’d capture others from Dokja’s friend group like Sangha or smth but still we can’t have someone from our holy trinity get caught up in this either

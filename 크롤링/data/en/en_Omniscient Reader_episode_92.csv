Episode,Date,Review
92,"Feb 16, 2022",wait. HE ACTUALLY IS MAKING HIMSELF A CONSTELLATION AND ADOPTING HER.
92,"Feb 16, 2022",damn wish Dokja would adopt me too so he can pay my tuition üòîüíî
92,"Feb 16, 2022",Love how Han Sooyoung is obviously exasperated and disappointed with their decision but respects it and doesn‚Äôt say anything else
92,"Feb 16, 2022",‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your super power?‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôm rich.‚Äù
92,"Feb 16, 2022","""I'm not a protagonist"" proceeds to make the most high-risk protagonistic choice he could possibly make."
92,"Feb 16, 2022",I'm sooooooo happy im finally seeing a full panel of KIm Dokja with THAT smile in THAT coat ‚ô°HAPPY BIRTHDAY YOU RAT BASTARD 2/15/22
92,"Feb 16, 2022","I love seeing the little differences in Dokja‚Äôs ruthlessness vs Joonghyuk‚Äôs. Joonghyuk‚Äôs priority is the world, saving the most people, but as a reader, Dokja is biased and wants to help people(not even just good/useful people! He had no real reason to help Huiwon other than she was in a tight spot)"
92,"Feb 16, 2022",the trauma of having to kill your own dog to survive‚Ä¶that ain‚Äôt going away. No wonder she has the Beast Tamer attribute
92,"Feb 16, 2022","I was initially skeptical when I found out they were finally making this story into a WEBTOON, but I have to say they have been remarkably true to the story thus far. They‚Äôve done a great job bringing this story to life. Props. "
92,"Feb 16, 2022",I have faith in Dokja's decision. If I learned anything from mythology it's that if you try to prevent a future with violence you only create the reason that future exists or worse. Also Dokja becoming a constellation tracks with his character arc lol
92,"Feb 16, 2022","Dokja just pulled the meme of ""Look at me, I am the constellation now"" to the star stream "
92,"Feb 16, 2022",and what more do i love than a very single salaryman and avid reader of webnovels adopting a daughter in a ruined world
92,"Feb 16, 2022","If someone must be killed because the future has already been decided, then there's no way any of it would be meaningful. It's the purpose of Yoo Joonghyuk's regression, to change and prevent certain things from happening."
92,"Feb 26, 2022",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' was heart broken with such words a child just said.][The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' will continue giving coins for her.][5 coins have been sponsored. ]
92,"Feb 16, 2022",hmm I mean maybe Dokja might succeed in changing her. he's certainly more caring than Junghyeok.
92,"Feb 16, 2022","Why does every 5th panel in this hit like a f***ing TRUCK. I immediately so bad for this little girl who feels like she has to DIE to save everyone else, and truly believes that she deserves that just because she was put into the worst situation possible. And then when Donna gives her all the packages and tells her that she will be stronger than everyone, Holy S**T! Dokja has spent the entire series trying to be the strongest, and is putting his trust in someone who he knows might kill everyone."
92,"Feb 16, 2022","I think the bad guy will be our little bug lover, oh no! "
92,"Mar 7, 2022",‚ÄúShe‚Äôs basically a Baby Thanos‚Äù The slander. 
92,"Feb 16, 2022","I'm really REALLY looking forward to this. I can't wait for the chapters to come out, I'll literally dump my whole wallet"
92,"Feb 16, 2022",Dokja vc: don't worry I'm a sugar daddy
92,"Feb 16, 2022",He's making choices to continue and set himself up to become a Fable ü§©
92,"Feb 16, 2022",It's gonna be a very long while to the end but it's gonna be a hell of journey along the way filled with every emotion you can muster. 
92,"Feb 16, 2022",HAHAHAHAHA THE EYES ON THAT YIKES PANEL I CANT
92,"Feb 16, 2022","[Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" smiles at Dokja's decision to let her live and awaits to see what the child's future self looks like.]"
92,"Feb 16, 2022","I dont want this story to ever end. I wanna be able to read it now and when I'm almost dead when I'm in my 90s and longer. I think that this story, among others, are truly timeless. The next generations ahead need to read it!"
92,"Feb 16, 2022",WHAT ABOUT GILEYONG????
92,"Mar 23, 2022","I really liked the part where dokja thinks as a reader. since protagonists would originally prioritize saving the WORLD with most sane and safe method, but us readers dont only fall in love with the protagonist, but with all of the characters around him/her, and reading the story as a reader, I would have wanted dokja to save her."
92,"Feb 16, 2022",basically.... I need the creators to put the story in physical book novel manga form and I need it in my apocolypse bunker library to educate the future. üíñüëÅüëÑüëÅ
92,"Feb 16, 2022",haha get ready to cry a river when this arc (and the season I'm assuming since it coincides w the end of book 1) is over
92,"Feb 16, 2022",I wanna give her a hug :(
92,"Mar 23, 2022","Congratulations gilyoung, now you have a sister :D "
92,"Feb 16, 2022",Hold up. Since he destroyed the throne and achieved fabled status then is he turning into a constellation? You could argue that the constellations are just other readers/viewers as well so it makes some sense right?
92,"Feb 16, 2022",Why am I seeing 'Happy Birthday Kdj' now? I'm just going to assume that it's currently Feb 15 for you guys.
92,"Feb 16, 2022",Happy Birthday to Kim Dokja!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
92,"Mar 23, 2022","it takes a village to raise a child, it tskes a child to blow up Seoul"
92,"Mar 24, 2022","after rereading this, it makes a lot sense, in a meta sense. I as a reader, don't want characters I love to suffer, and want those that are sympathetic or tragic to avert their paths of destruction. Dokja, taking the power he has as a reader to create his own ending, is something readers do all the time in real life."
92,"Mar 23, 2022","Five days for you, five weeks for us üòÖ"
92,"Feb 16, 2022",Please let there be a wholesome adorable friendship between this girl and Gilyeoung!
92,"Mar 23, 2022","""dont worry, i have a lot of money"" well i want a problem like that too"
92,"Mar 23, 2022",Dokja really trying to go for that 100% Good Ending 
92,"Feb 16, 2022","Papi Warbucks got a insect tamer already, but he bout to get a beast tamer on deck too! I like how they going back to what he's been doing since the beginning. Cutting the fucking middle men  and changing the game. Very good!"
92,"Mar 23, 2022",Did han sooyoung called her a Baby thanos?? ü§£ü§£ And still waiting for gilyoung. 
92,"Mar 23, 2022",omg omg the way yoosung looked up at him when he said that her death isn't part of the ending he wanted omg PRECIOUS and ofc the art is so lovely as always
92,"Feb 16, 2022",WHO let the onion Ninjas in the chapter?üò≠
92,"Mar 23, 2022",can't they just stick with 'ahjussi' instead of 'mister' or even 'old man'? i remember jihye once called dokja as old man a few chapters ago? 
92,"Mar 23, 2022",I‚Äôm so jealous of all the people who never read this online and are getting to see this for the first time. This story is only beginning and every chapter is better than the last. Get ready to enjoy years of greatness. If you liked Solo Leveling then lock in because this is MUCH BETTER and TWICE as long. 
92,"Mar 23, 2022",Dokja here adopting kids left and right. First our insect lord boi and now this beast lord bean
92,"Mar 23, 2022",[An unknown constellation sheds a tear of happiness for Dokja‚Äôs family is growing]
92,"Mar 23, 2022","Dokja be like ""She's going to be my first incarnation"". And I'm like ""Wut?"". Aaand now it's official that Dokja is aiming to become a constellation, isn't it? "
92,"Mar 23, 2022",no ahjussi ‡≤•‚Äø‡≤•. they didn't use uncle so that's a plus I suppose
92,"Feb 16, 2022",I wonder what the constellation are thinkingü§î...Constellations*: Did this Incarnation just sponsor another Incarnation...wt* is going onü§®
92,"Mar 23, 2022",dokja do really have a weak spot for children:)
92,"Mar 23, 2022","insect lord checkbeast lord check
what's the next child controller"
92,"Mar 23, 2022",All the kids are tamers lol
92,"Mar 23, 2022",This isn‚Äôt the end of Dokja wooing and adopting people in his company. 
92,"Mar 16, 2022","a Baby Tha...?
... Baby Thanos????"
92,"Feb 17, 2022","Dude just basically went ‚Äúnah, I‚Äôm not gonna kill you, I‚Äôm gonna adopt you!‚Äù"
92,"Feb 16, 2022",Is Dokja accepting applications to pay some bills for someone or something? How do I apply?
92,"Mar 23, 2022","what's interesting is that children of this series are more competent than most adults combined. jihye, gilyoung, and now yoosung."
92,"Mar 26, 2022",Dokja genuinely cares for Junghyeok and he cares for the kid too. How to have someone like him? Adopt me too please~
92,"Feb 16, 2022",sugar daddy Dokja üò©
92,"Mar 23, 2022",her and Gilyeong about to rule the world 
92,"Mar 23, 2022",Oh yes (the gang) is all coming together
92,"Mar 23, 2022","I swear when all of this is over dokja is gonna have a whole ass family and he's still a virgin lol, wish I was dokja."
92,"Mar 23, 2022","*pokes kdj* come on, do something..."
92,"Mar 23, 2022",Dokja Kim God of readers
92,"Mar 23, 2022",Plot twist new kid
92,"Mar 23, 2022","All I can think of is the garter belt scene, it was a mistake to make her an incarnation ‚Äúguys he‚Äôs right there‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
92,"Feb 19, 2022","Can't we just get a thumbs up for a series, I mean this is the best comic on the platform. Action, Intrigue, and the whole thing still feels like they are humans stuck in this situations not demi-gods in a time loop. Just so amazing!"
92,"Feb 18, 2022","Dokja is really Uncle Ben‚Ä¶‚ÄúWith Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility‚Äù"
92,"Feb 16, 2022","Could Secretive Plotter be Dokja, if that makes sense? At the beginning of the Story, he had mentioned Secretive Plotter was the only constellation he didn‚Äôt know about how in the options given to him. Maybe this is the start of his ride to becoming a constellation."
92,"Mar 27, 2022",wow dokja is getting cuter in this ep :D
92,"Mar 24, 2022",He's the post apocalyptic Korean version of Batman LOL
92,"Mar 24, 2022",Please tell me Sooyoung did not just call the little girl baby thanos-
92,"Mar 23, 2022","Damn dokja done said ""for junghyeok's sake"" ü§®ü§®ü§®ü§®ü§®ü§®ü§®ü§®ü§®ü§®ü§®ü§®ü§®"
92,"Mar 23, 2022","[Constellation, Lover of Glucose Patriarch, is drooling over Incarnation Kim Dokja]"
92,"Mar 23, 2022",The things she did just to survive the harsh world. 
92,"Mar 23, 2022",When Dokja holds the 'Supporting Constellation Selection Event' later I am 100% sure he is going to pick himself.
92,"Feb 16, 2022","heck yeh! So cool 4 him to think of her as his incarnation & support her! So glad he's gonna help her rather than punish her for things she had no choice in doing to survive. I mean the adults have done far worse than her & felt no remorse. Fact she feels remorse every time & so much so she wants & accepts being killed, shows how kind hearted she is & I have so much hope for her & so proud of dokja for taking her under his wing! I mean he has to spend his fortune on something, y not her growth!"
92,"Feb 16, 2022","Omg it‚Äôs actually freaking clicking for me, What are the constellations? Readers/watchers of all of this. What is Dokja, a reader who has sponsored a dokabei‚Äôs stream, got another constellation‚Äôs incarnation under his own contract, created his own fable which hey all the constellations are fables or myths‚Ä¶AND NOW IS GOING TO SUPPORT HIS OWN INCARNATION OMG THIS IS GENIUS "
92,"Mar 29, 2022",I like how dokja is very wise and thoughtful of all his decisions. since the beginning he‚Äôs made decisions that changed the original story which he ended up gaining stuff from it despite being a reader and not the mc. I hope this story ends up being successful enough to have hard copies bc I‚Äôll surely buy them!!!
92,"Mar 27, 2022",This is one of the best webtoons I have read!
92,"Mar 26, 2022","Child's point of view : "" iam kim dokja and I've got a lot of money"" üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
92,"Mar 26, 2022",Wouldn‚Äôt it be cool for her to meet the little boy who can summon bugs? I forget his name
92,"Mar 25, 2022","I straight read this for one day and now am here, ackkk can't wait!üòç This needs to have an anime adaptation!"
92,"Mar 25, 2022",dokja kim is insane i love him. 
92,"Mar 24, 2022",he is actually thinking about saving her not because he loves or sth but because of Junghyeok's sake =)))
92,"Mar 23, 2022",sys is so strong. i honestly dont think i would've survived that long if this actually happened 
92,"Feb 21, 2022","I love how they express trauma for this little girl, everything that happened is very traumatic but with Dokja I tend to forgot how they end up here... the baby dog though it hurts me. And damn Dokja is becoming a constellation and he adopted another child already"
92,"Feb 16, 2022",whoaaa so he is basically a constellation
92,"Mar 28, 2022","so I'm just gonna leave a comment here. i only read omniscient reader here, and I don't even fast pass. then I went on Pinterest. the SPOILERS. I saw wings, horns and and my heart is in pieces right now after seeing what all is going to happen. i just wish I never went there."
92,"Mar 26, 2022","finally I got to this point. (i started reading 5 days ago). poor little girl, she doesn't desearv this. however, out insect buddy is scaring me more right now ..."
92,"Mar 25, 2022","""Something even Jungyeok Yu couldn't stop"" Thankfully the true MC Dokja Kim is here this time around. His decisiveness is impressive. Since he doesn't want to kill her, he'll make her even stronger. Doing things half assedly is doomed to fail. Understanding this isn't too hard, but actually doing it requires a lot of courage. "
92,"Mar 25, 2022",I want Dokja to sponsor me tooüò≠üò≠üò≠
92,"Mar 25, 2022",help that one panel where kdj is smiling and it's like really bright behind him like im just...üôá
92,"Mar 24, 2022",Sugar daddy dokja arc
92,"Mar 24, 2022","he will get 3 incarnation 1 taming beast
 2 taming insect
 3 infinite turret defense"
92,"Mar 23, 2022",Dokja gonna end up adopting like 5 kids after the series ends. Would really love that to happen!
92,"Mar 23, 2022","Holy frick, I can‚Äôt wait to see the constellations reaction, Dokja just pulling off stuff nobody could ever think of... such a bright imagination, truly a reader."
92,"Mar 23, 2022",A baby thanos lolll
92,"Mar 23, 2022",I am so excited‚îå(„Éª„ÄÇ„Éª)‚îò‚ô™
92,"Mar 23, 2022","Omniscient Reader meets Cosmic Ghost Rider lol. Why kill baby Thanos, when you can raise him into a good little mercenary like his poppa?"
92,"Mar 23, 2022",Why is no one taking about the little Baby Thanos comment?
92,"Mar 23, 2022",‚ÄúShe‚Äôs basically a baby Thanos‚Äù XD
92,"Apr 25, 2022","So Dokja has now adopted two kids with interspecies communication. If they get stronger, they can just have an army of animals."
92,"Apr 12, 2022","""She's basically a baby Thanos"""
92,"Apr 7, 2022",baby thanos comment?
92,"Mar 29, 2022","There's also a starter pack here in webtoon, filled with coins. Does any emerging constellation with to gift it to me? I'm promising maybe."
92,"Mar 28, 2022","It‚Äôs not evil wanting to survive and live, it may seem like a bad thing but it isn‚Äôt wrong, it‚Äôs not wrong wanting to live and do anything to live"
92,"Mar 28, 2022",I forgot he was a fable the king of the world without a king
92,"Mar 28, 2022",Constellation ‚ÄúDokja Kim the omniscient no killing immortal king with no thrown‚Äù is that too I don‚Äôt know?ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
92,"Mar 26, 2022","wait, is Dokja's supporting constellation going to be himself? bro imagine seeing system slide saying, ""The constellation 'omniscient harbinger' has no intentions of letting you know the answer to your predicament"". That would be dope ngl"
92,"Mar 25, 2022","...I just finished the Scenario 5 arc and I'm screaming, shaking, sobbing, crying. Floods of tears are tearing on my heart and I can't believe it."
92,"Mar 24, 2022","And thus, Dokja adopts ‚ú®another child‚ú®"
92,"Mar 24, 2022",haha love that joke Baby Thanos
92,"Mar 24, 2022",Want Yeseung and Gilyeong to meet and be friends. They will be unstoppable. 
92,"Mar 23, 2022","the novel readers kinda make this comic not that fun lol. i am one myself,but novel readers of this comic makes them superior. so many spoilers, i recommend not to read comments on webtoon"
92,"Mar 23, 2022","I don‚Äôt understand, so she becomes a catastrophe in 5 days, but the event that makes her a catastrophe is far in the future‚Ä¶Huh???? Unless they mean her future self comes back and does it, but if that‚Äôs what they meant then they should explain it better. Not a big fan of this chapter, i hate the moral dilemma cliche is apocalyptic fiction. And Dokja‚Äôs speech about why he wouldn‚Äôt kill her really doesn‚Äôt make sense to me either lmao. Oh well hopefully next ep makes up for this one."
92,"Mar 23, 2022","So basically, her future self is going to arrive in Seoul, and what she is in the future depends on what they make her into in this round during the last 5 days! Awesome!"
92,"Mar 23, 2022",Just about broke my jaw in shock!! 
92,"Mar 23, 2022",What he did is giving me sugar daddy vibe and I love it!!!
92,"Mar 23, 2022",Who... are you? I am Sugar. Sugar Daddy
92,"Mar 23, 2022",What does introspective killer mean? That she's reflecting a lot about killing someone? 
92,"Mar 23, 2022","Also, WHERE IS YOSUNG OR JIYHE CALLING DOKJA AN AJUSSHI PLSSS JSGSJSK ITS SO FUNNY IN THE NOVEL, AND THE CONTRAST WITH GILYEONG IS SUPERIOR "
92,"Mar 23, 2022",Dokja: I hate constelations! Also Dokja: let me set smth so I can become one lmao
92,"Mar 23, 2022","I'm Dokja... Dokja Kim... But, you can call me Dad... üòÅ"
92,"Mar 23, 2022",so dokja has now two monster Summon friends.one is a random met in train.the other is a story character who is his incarnation 
92,"Mar 23, 2022",so constellations are basically sugar daddies-
92,"Mar 23, 2022",I am worried that since yuseung isn't the catastrophe anymore someone else is going to become one ahem Gilyeong.
92,"Mar 23, 2022","Sooo... Dokja straight up plans to have this girl fight and beat her future self, doesn't he?"
92,"Mar 23, 2022",let me say it in Spanish just for once: como molas Dokja!!!! estoy enamorada!!

92,"Mar 23, 2022",But how does she get so strong since it looks like she's pretty average  in strength and talent
92,"Mar 23, 2022",She and Gilyoung can be friends! Maybe even start their own little fake chat where they just talk through insects.
92,"Mar 23, 2022",This isn‚Äôt Dokja‚Äôs brightest idea but it isn‚Äôt his worse if anything having her become a catastrophe in less then a few days is interesting.I wonder what he will do during the five days since he now actually became a Incarnation .
92,"Mar 23, 2022",And the gamble begins.
92,"Mar 23, 2022",Yayyy! He adopted her and made her his future incarnation!
92,"Mar 23, 2022","Dokja adopted another kid with very strong powers. Now he has a Beast Lord and a Insect Patriarch, he only needs a Serpent Queen and a Avian King(or serpent king and avian queen) to complete his dream team"
92,"Mar 23, 2022","aah i keep rereading this chapter to procrastinate and i have Thoughts (tm), and i need to write them down SOMEWHERE, but they are Spoilery, and i don't want to spoil my friend through our groupchat. i shall be putting my Spoilery Thoughts in the replies to this comment, so please just continue scrolling and ignore me :D"

92,"Mar 23, 2022",the little girl in the prologue has appeared! 
92,"Mar 23, 2022",What is the name of the little boy who can also control beasts ? (and who is a more well rounded psychopath than the little girl)
92,"Mar 23, 2022",when we forgot that he's a fable:
92,"Mar 23, 2022",what if insect boy becomes the catastrophe?!
92,"Mar 23, 2022",ayo this is kinda heartwarming...

92,"Mar 23, 2022","Honestly, I'm gonna keep reading this comic for as long as I can...."
92,"Mar 23, 2022",I'm glad he chose to let her live but the puppy!! the poor puppy!!!!
92,"Mar 23, 2022",So she can control beasts like Gilyeong noicee
92,"Mar 23, 2022","So the point of Junghyeok's regressions was to save Yuseung and get as close to a perfect future (or ending) as he could? That's sweet ^_^ Though I have to admit, I would have sided with Suyeong. The girl has been shown to have destroyed Seoul in multiple regressions. She is pretty dangerous. Though I'm a little mean, aren't I? Edit: Thanks, Cheesy as Pie, for the clarification. Other readers, there are mild spoilers in the comments."
92,"Mar 23, 2022",THE DOG NOOO
92,"Feb 20, 2022",I love Dokja even more now!
92,"Feb 16, 2022",I love this little group they've made for themselves Sangah is definitely the light Han is the dark and Donna is the one in the middle the grey it's also great to see Sangah being a bit more aggressive to adapt to the situation they're all in but still be a cinnamon roll and Han is obviously becoming softer the more time she spends with Dokja I love this kind of character building ALSO from this point on this is just me and the fact the author threw in our face a while back but LET TE HAREM GROW
92,"Feb 16, 2022",she reminds me of insect boy (I forgot his name plz don't kill me)
92,"Feb 16, 2022",Dokja throwing money to make the kid grow is hysterical 
92,"Feb 16, 2022",I sometimes regret spoiling myselfü•≤

92,"Feb 16, 2022",Bro her little scene had me in tears not the puppy :(
92,"Feb 16, 2022",Yep. That baby Thanos Han Sooyoung is talking about is exactly like in the Marvel. The heroes tried to raise and guide baby Thanos to not become a villain instead of killing him. But it didn't end well and prevented nothing.
92,"Oct 5, 2022","Rereading really makes me realize just how much dokja does for junghyeoks sake even if he doesn‚Äôt ever show it. It‚Äôs not so much trying to help his favorite character as saying ‚Äúyou saved me, so now I‚Äôll save you ‚Äú "

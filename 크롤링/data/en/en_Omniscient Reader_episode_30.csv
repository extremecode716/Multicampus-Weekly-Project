30,"Jan 13, 2021","what really made me laugh was them adding ""ugly mug"" into the translation out of Nowhere. originally the line is just him admitting to staring. they probably added in ""ugly mug"" for one of two reasons. option one is to try and convey the informal tone that kdj uses with yjh. option two is to try (in vain) to make the line seem less like kdj Checking Out yjh lmao. honestly? probably both"

30,"Nov 25, 2020","I'm interested to see what scheme Jung is pulling, the school survivor girl is definitely going to join dokja or leave jung when they reveal what he is really about at the end if this scenario. I also don't think Jung was alarmed by our evil slaying wife I think it was the kid and his extraordinary ability to commune with so many types of creatures. a skill that could be refined into many uses. Even his co worker being able to translate creatures and languages is amazing "

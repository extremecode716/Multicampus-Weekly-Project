Episode,Date,Review
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Everyone on here probably on chapter 17
4,"Aug 19, 2020","Hell yeah it’s finally on WEBTOON. For the new readers, it gets wild and is an absolute gem of a webcomic"
4,"Aug 19, 2020",AAAHHH I’m so happy my favorite Korean novel got a webtoon!!!!
4,"Aug 19, 2020",FINALLY NOW I CAN READ THIS LEGALLY 
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Dang I probably wouldn’t survive if this happened to me. MC has like 3000 IQ
4,"Aug 19, 2020",This kid must have some good ass memory. I mean to be able to remember the exact scenario from 10 years ago like couldn't be me. I can't even remember what I had for dinner last night
4,"Aug 19, 2020",wait a sec were the bugs he was holding on the train as a kid just a reference to what was literally about to happen?
4,"Aug 19, 2020","Welp, I look forward to the next 3150 episodes of this, I better not be the only one still reading by then"
4,"Aug 19, 2020","am I the only one who'd be on my hands and knees looking in every crevice for a bug to kill since it says ""ANY"" living organism?"
4,"Aug 19, 2020","When you're the protagonist, but have no idea you're protagonist "
4,"Aug 19, 2020","just like now, no one seems to have and sanitizer that they could spray to kill some germs. Millions, billions, TRILLIONS of germs. without any human casualties!"
4,"Aug 19, 2020",holy moly that's one agresive furbie
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Real ones been reading since it was a manhwa
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Don't forget to like every chapter 💕. 
4,"Aug 19, 2020",I'm guessing the dude in the black coat was the novel's protagonist
4,"Aug 19, 2020","The art reminds me of solo leveling, anyone? "
4,"Aug 20, 2020","Not gonna lie, I kinda wanna see this turn into an anime. It looks like anime material."
4,"Aug 19, 2020",What if TLS stands for The Last Survivor?
4,"Aug 21, 2020",i think it's more appropriate for them to call it a 'planet emergency' instead of a 'national emergency' lol
4,"Aug 19, 2020",well then.... consider me subscribed. IMMEDIATELY
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Honestly one of the best Korean novels I’ve finished. Can’t wait to see the future chapters 😀
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Ok but who’s a bit worried about that silver haired dude smirking about getting a reason to kill people earlier
4,"Aug 19, 2020","Is Wednesday apocalypse day or something? (Rebirth, Midwinter, this)"
4,"Aug 19, 2020","So to those who want to know if this is good, yes. It really is. I finished the novel two months ago and let me say, it legit gave me such an experience. I don't know how to describe what I felt but it was one of the best especially when your imagination is wild and all. Like, I've read quite a number of webnovels now and no other webnovel ever really made me this hooked so I really have high expectations for the manhwa. I'm really excited to see how specific scenes will be drawn >_<"
4,"Aug 19, 2020","y'all, trust me, you won't regret reading this, there's a reason the novel is one of the highest rated novels on NU (novelupdates)!"

I don't think it is gonna disappoint me"
4,"Aug 19, 2020","I'm still calling it ""ways of survival"" for short. "
4,"Aug 22, 2020",if ANYONE spoils this I will personally find you and delete your webtoon account.
4,"Sep 22, 2021",GO KILL THE INSECTS. THERE'S A CHILD THERE THAT HAS CONTAINER WITH BUGS!!!! THAT'S A LIVING ORGANISM GOSH
4,"Apr 28, 2021","I'm just thinking, if all they need to do is kill a living organism... then can't they just use some hand sanitizer to kill the bacteria on their hands???"
4,"Apr 26, 2021",Humans aren't the only living organisms right🙃
4,"Aug 22, 2020","Whoever ""HE"" is, I'm probs gonna simp for him"
4,"Oct 14, 2020",Me steps on cockroach* does this count?
4,"Aug 25, 2020",Kill one or more living organisms...why don’t they just look around for some insects or flies to kill then? Or just put on some hand sanitizer...
4,"Aug 20, 2020",so this Webtoon is basically what every anime fan wants to happen to them? Makes sense.
4,"Aug 20, 2020","A kid has plenty of bugs in a box, just kill them, the only rule is killing a living organisms!"
4,"Sep 16, 2021",They just gotta kill the bugs that kid has in the tank

4,"Aug 27, 2020","I want to get into this story, but all I can think is that bacteria are living creatures. They could all survive if at least one person had hand sanitizer."
4,"Aug 25, 2020","bacteria can be counted as living organisms, right? 
**whips out hand sanitizers to save the day!**"
4,"Aug 25, 2020","I would like to say this problem could easily be solved with hand sanitizer; the sign said to kill one or more LIVING ORGANISMS (like germs), not just people."
4,"Aug 21, 2020",This is just like 2020 in my option
4,"Aug 20, 2020","There was some kid with insects... why not kill them? The poor things are living organisms... Also, our cells are living organisms... So if you peel some of your skin until you bleed, you'd be killing some cells..."
4,"Aug 19, 2020",*calmly takes out hand sanitizer and kills 99.9% of the bacteria on my hand* done!!

4,"Aug 26, 2020",*me if I was on the train* well time to see if hand sanitizer really does kill 99% of germs
4,"Aug 26, 2020","If I wash my hands with hand sanitizer would that count as ""killing one or more lifeforms""? "
4,"Aug 25, 2020","They don’t need to kill a HUMAN to pass the test. It said to kill an organism, meaning that you could just kill a bug and you would’ve passed the test 😂"
4,"Aug 25, 2020",Listen....any...living...thing....if someone doesnt kill those crickets...i swear too gawd
4,"Aug 25, 2020",hey i found a loop hole they say kill an living thing so they can kill bugs too right?
4,"Aug 25, 2020",I wonder if they can just kill the grasshoppers to survive?
4,"Aug 25, 2020","it says ""living organism"".  There was a child with a box full of some kind of insects. They should kill it, no? They could survive to this ""challenge"" without actually kill a human being "
4,"Aug 24, 2020",I'd be searching so hard for a spider or cockroach. Any living organism right?

4,"Aug 22, 2020",HOW IS THIS NOT A SHOW ALREADY!!!!! ITS SOO GOOOD!!!!! Great job
4,"Aug 19, 2020",just kill the bugs the little boy has duh
4,"Aug 19, 2020",what about bugs? they can find an ant or something

4,"Nov 17, 2021",well it said living organisms i guess find an ant or something?
4,"Aug 31, 2021",this gives me Danganronpa vibes for same reason
4,"Aug 30, 2021","animals and plants are living organisms right, soooo..."
4,"Aug 13, 2021","Why don't they just kill the bugs that kid was holding, they're living organisms."
4,"Jun 18, 2021",why doesn't he just kill a bug from that random kids box?
4,"Jun 16, 2021",how about consume some dirty thing inside the cabin ... your stomach is capable of killing many single cell organism in an instant... well some doesn't
4,"Jun 14, 2021",can we talk about his good memorization lol he read it for 10 years and still clearly remember the first chap 😭😭
4,"Jun 9, 2021","me - "" how many bugs can I find on this train."""
4,"Jun 7, 2021",BTW.. how the heck can someone spend a fuckin decade reading a novel.. I mean it'd be understandable in case of a comic but a novel is just writing with no pictures.. u gotta imagine things..damn..salute to his dedication.. now I know why he failed the exam and is still single😂😂(like me🥲🥲) 
4,"May 2, 2021",Why not just crush a bug
4,"Apr 29, 2021",Just use some hand sanitizer? Kill a few microbes. Pass the bottle around to everybody. Problem solved.
4,"Apr 29, 2021",cant they like kill a bug they said an organism
4,"Apr 27, 2021",I was just here for free coins but I don't think I'll be leaving any time soon 
4,"Apr 27, 2021",Who else came just for the coins at first but then fell in love with this book?
4,"Apr 26, 2021","everyone else: *panicking* dokja: ""so when can i meet the protag?"""
4,"Apr 26, 2021","ah yes The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History aka The Tragedy or The Worst, Most Despair-inducing Incident in the History of Mankindif ya know ya know🙃"
4,"Apr 26, 2021",the lieutenant is cute.. and prob gonna die.. prepping myself early for that day o-o
4,"Apr 16, 2021","just kill a bug or something, it didn't say to kill a human"
4,"Mar 21, 2021","""Living organism"" the first time I saw that I literally just thought ""I know there aren't enough humans but just squash some bugs or something"""
4,"Mar 2, 2021",Why is literally everyone's first thought to kill other humans? Why not try killing an ant or washing your hands to kill the bacteria? Those are still living organisms
4,"Feb 21, 2021","Y’know, bacteria counts as a “living organism” and our immune systems kill millions of them all the time. So technically, everyone should clear this scenario easily...."
4,"Feb 1, 2021",Never mind ants. People out here forgetting bacteria exist
4,"Jan 21, 2021",This is kind of like when no one wants to be the first one to open the bag of food at the party but we are all thinking it.
4,"Jan 6, 2021",yeah I don't think I would have survived
4,"Nov 3, 2020",Oooooooo this is getting me intense🤭
4,"Oct 16, 2020",Why do they automatically think they have to kill humans? it's not the only living organism. They could just squash ants or something like plants.
4,"Oct 15, 2020","there's one thing bothering me a bit... The task doesn't specify that a human must be killed, so if they just killed something small like an ant wouldn't it be enough to complete the task?"
4,"Oct 14, 2020",kill the bugs
4,"Oct 2, 2020",well they could have just killed a bug... a bug is a living organism lmoa. No need to kill anyone 😂
4,"Sep 30, 2020",Can’t they get like hand sanitizer and kill bacteria or is that my inner microbiologist thinking too hard
4,"Sep 22, 2020",this webtoon should become an anime or a show cause it's so good. 
4,"Sep 14, 2020",Well I take back my last comment guess picking a flower is not an option here.
4,"Aug 30, 2020","If this could be adapted into an anime, ill be so damn happy "
4,"Aug 29, 2020","Hmm the instructions definitely said ""living organisms"" and not ""humans"" for a reason. ^^ Come on, peeps. Pull yourselves together and kill some bugs or mosquitos or something! As an ex-video gamer...I totally agree that us gamers would deal with the Apocalypse a bit faster than the normies lol."
4,"Aug 28, 2020",This intro is very Danganronpa. I like it. 😏
4,"Aug 28, 2020",The human body is made up of multiple living organisms that can be killed by being cut/burned so technically you could kill pieces of your body ... or even kill germs with a sanitizer or soap
4,"Aug 28, 2020",wait the screen only says kill one or more living organisms so does killing the grasshopper that the kid is carrying counts right 🤔
4,"Aug 26, 2020",they gotta kill 1 living organism right ? so I'm guessing insects count too ?
4,"Aug 25, 2020",dude.... there was a small boy carrying a glass box full of insects... just kill the insects they're still living organisms so it should count right
4,"Aug 25, 2020","fuck, i gotta simp"
4,"Aug 25, 2020",QUICK STRANGLE A PLANT
4,"Aug 25, 2020",Hey everyone. Remember that kid shown in chapter 1 with 6 crickets...... now 6 people won’t have to someone ....that god crickets are “living organisms”
4,"Aug 24, 2020","well he or that thing says it kills living organisms and your body (immune system) is killing bacteria every day so they should have passed that test from the moment it started because it doesn't specify if the living organism has to be macroscopic  or microscopic but still, it's a good comic 👍"
4,"Aug 24, 2020","wasn't there a kid with a box of bugs? ""Kill one living organism"". Can't they just squish a bug each and be safe?"
4,"Aug 24, 2020","Any living organism, right? How about some desinfactant? Thousands, if not millions of organisms killed in half a minute... "
4,"Aug 24, 2020",Oh boi I just finished Sweet Home and I got my new comic to look forward to. Whoop
4,"Aug 24, 2020",Wait- cant they just take a plant out of it’s roots?? It says to kill one living organism so it should count(Ive not read the novel dont come at me)
4,"Aug 24, 2020","I think the obvious solution is to use hand sanitizer to kill germs on everyone's hands. That way everyone kills a ""living organism"" without killing any people or animals"
4,"Aug 24, 2020",dokja may have the advantage of knowing the scenarios and what happens but it's also a skill to know how to use those knowledge effectively!Love these type of MCs👌
4,"Aug 24, 2020",imagine you're the only one reading this in 8 years
4,"Aug 23, 2020",Hand Sanitizer kills 99.9% of germs. Bacteria are living organisms.
4,"Aug 23, 2020",I have a feeling this comic will soon be up there with solo leveling in regards of popularity. 
4,"Aug 22, 2020",Is- is this what happens after 2020?
4,"Aug 21, 2020",just read ahead to chapter 18. I'll be reading and liking it here as well to help support you. my main place to read it will be elsewhere though. thank you very much for bringing it here.
4,"Aug 21, 2020","I originaly started reading this somewhere else, but I am so glad this is being added on webtoons and that I have somewhere I can through my support!!! [ Star Constilation ""Sayo Grace"" has taking an extream liking to this webtoon. You obtain four votes! ] 😉🤣💙"
4,"Aug 21, 2020",So they made a comic that was originally a novel out of a novel in the novel. How novel🤔
4,"Aug 21, 2020",The question is are there going to be over 3000 chapters of the webtoon 
4,"Aug 21, 2020",i dont have any money 
4,"Aug 21, 2020","Compared to all the others, I have to say hands down that this is the best WebToon I’ve ever read. For starters the plot is thrilling and original. Usually characters are dragged into another world, however in this case another world is dragged to the characters. I really hope this becomes an anime!"
4,"Aug 20, 2020","i read the web novel and was so excited to find out it had a webtoon! for all the newcomers: you’re in for a wild, wild ride."
4,"Aug 20, 2020","Okay ya’ll hold up no, WHERE CAN I READ THE NOVEL?!?? [im still gonna read/watch this webtoon though] but i wanna save for future !!!!! "
4,"Aug 19, 2020","I'm actually quite concerned for this webtoon though... I have read Omniscient Reader and it is quite long.. Most super long novels don't last very long and lose traction, even though Webtoon has a Huge Platform hopefully the audience will stay here as well <3"
4,"Aug 19, 2020","this is giving me ""Dice"" vibes also if the novel had over 3000 ep does that mean the webtoon will too?...nvm😅 about the episodes "
4,"Aug 19, 2020",I'm making it my fav webtoon now( ╹▽╹ )
4,"Aug 19, 2020","I just thought about it. Since this is on here, chances of this webtoon getting animated are pretty high 👀 "
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Lee Jihye and Lee Hyunsung has made into this chapter woop woop. Now lets wait for the 'real' protagonist hihi. All of you will swoon over him.
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Tbh i kinda hope that this comic goes on for ten years cause this is really good!
4,"Aug 19, 2020",This has to get the attention it deserves.
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Too bad nobody had any plants... they count right?
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Just a casual wait for atleast 2 months for the people who have read till chapter 18.
4,"Jun 7, 2022",It says “living organism” just KILL THE BUGS jeez
4,"Mar 25, 2022",I'm rereading for 4th time cuz it's my comfort zone.. looking at new readers I wanna hold my laughter.. novel is so cool as well
4,"Dec 24, 2021",This is why I love fantasy it give me goosebumps
4,"Dec 16, 2021",the protag is asking where the protag is is funny 
4,"Oct 19, 2021",avid webtoon readers are kinda cringe. the difference between comments on this platform and others is.... 😆😆
4,"Sep 3, 2021","[Someone admires Dokja's calm pose throughout the chaos, as well as Jihye Lee's willingness to survive.]"
4,"Sep 1, 2021","if the plot of the web novel is playing out in real life in this series, we readers are indirectly reading the novel . and if this webtoon is really popular why wasnt the novel which had ONLY 1 view.edit: imagine we are reading this and this plot plays out in our real life. i guess we'll know exactly what to do"
4,"Aug 29, 2021","they could kill the bugs that were in the kid's container, those are living organisms too"
4,"Jul 26, 2021",DID ANYONE REMEMBER THAT ONE PANEL WHERE A BOY WAS HOLDING A CONTAINER OF INSECTS? ITS A LIVING ORGANISM SO THEY CAN KILL IT RIGHT
4,"Jul 8, 2021",Why not just kill a bug or something 😭😭
4,"Jun 7, 2021",Damnnn!! Sonn!!!...one of the most unique stories I've ever read...it's kinda giving me chills...also.. I thought the creature would be similar to goblins..the heck man?.. it's not even comparable to a goblin...but I've seen this kinda creature somewhere I don't remember. ..well this comic's nailing it!! 
4,"May 4, 2021",They should just kill the bugs the kid had
4,"May 1, 2021","I'm supposedly reading this for the coin raid, but now this story is really something else. Can't wait for the next big things to happen!!! ❤️❤️❤️"
4,"Apr 28, 2021",This reminds me of danganropa 
4,"Apr 27, 2021",I’d rip up a ton of grass. Kill it all! 
4,"Apr 27, 2021",Who is here rereading this story for the coins?? AND STILL ENJOYING IT?!
4,"Apr 27, 2021","white demon bear really said ""🔴 👄 🔴"""
4,"Apr 26, 2021",don't forget to like the episode everyone
4,"Apr 26, 2021",This is giving me such Danganronpa vibes lmaoo
4,"Apr 26, 2021",but like... kill the bugs?
4,"Apr 26, 2021","""Take a deep breath and stop whatever you're doing"" and read Weebtoon"
4,"Apr 21, 2021",if I were in this situation its either I'll be the first one to kill or the first one to die
4,"Apr 1, 2021",Isn't it obvious? Living organism isn't only limited to humans. They can kill bacteria using alcohol damn HHAHAHHAHA
4,"Feb 5, 2021",so what if u kill an ant? do u pass? I mean it is a living organism😂
4,"Feb 3, 2021","its hella interesting but other then that, that thing (forgot its name deokabi or something) is pretty cute."
4,"Jan 28, 2021",Man this just hits different after finishing the novel 😭
4,"Jan 8, 2021",Can someone just rip a leaf or kill a cockroach or something? They said organism 
4,"Dec 16, 2020",just kill a bug
4,"Nov 7, 2020","I looked and i was like wait what, why the heck am i not subscribed!?"
4,"Nov 5, 2020",They certainly love writing about kids getting killed in Korea
4,"Nov 2, 2020","not gonna lie I would kill a bitch too,  if it meant I would survive "
4,"Oct 31, 2020",Aren't Hyeongseong Lee(the army man) and Jihye Lee(the survived of the girls school)siblings? 
4,"Oct 14, 2020",I just started reading this and I'd take a guess that the character he's looking for is actually himself....
4,"Oct 14, 2020","honestly tho is the cabin THAT clean that you can't even find a bug to kill? It says ""living organism..."" "
4,"Oct 14, 2020",Hand sanitizer?
4,"Oct 12, 2020",The people who didn't take his story recommend really fucked up 😂
4,"Sep 18, 2020"," This reminds me of Train To Busan except instead of zombies, a Jiggly Puff is killing people and turning them against each other."
4,"Sep 8, 2020","I thought they were gonna out smart it, because the rules said ""any living organism"" (now this might be because it couldn't be translated, this might've been originally written in Korean and the translation wasn't able to be done perfectly) that means anything that is living, that includes plants, animals and insects and stuff, if they could find and kill flies they could've been safe,also this wont make a good story BUT bacteria are living, so hand sanitizers will also get the job done"
4,"Sep 2, 2020",time to get bug stomping i assume. that kid had a tank of bugs right........
4,"Aug 30, 2020",I bet five bucks that the character he is waiting for is himself!
4,"Aug 29, 2020",Umm why don’t they kill the cockroaches in that kids bin?
4,"Aug 28, 2020",Mr Lieutenant can catch this heart 😔👌🏻
4,"Aug 28, 2020",can't you just kill a bug lmao 
4,"Aug 27, 2020","I said I would start this a week ago a little after midnight. Now, it’s 7:42am and I officially finished binge reading the webnovel of 551 chapters. The pain, the thrill, the euphoria😭"
4,"Aug 27, 2020",So... you need to find the nearest bug.... AND KILL IT!
4,"Aug 26, 2020","When you start reading a comic to earn the free WEBTOON coins, but then you actually start liking it and use your coins immediately😅"
4,"Aug 26, 2020",so I started reading this comic for the free coins but now I will read it even if it has 10000 episodes 
4,"Aug 26, 2020",kill an ant?
4,"Aug 26, 2020",Just kill a plant or a bug
4,"Aug 25, 2020","I just binge read most of the novel, and I can safely say that I’ve never been so addicted to anything like I am to Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint..."
4,"Aug 25, 2020",This is a crazy project that Webtoon has stared .I am like on chapter 125 out of 545 and soooo many stuff have happened and it's not like anything can be edited out or suppressed in my opinion. Like this is going to take 10-15 years and even more to make it into a full-fledged comic.i am excited and I trust Webtoon to take good care of illustrating the novel
4,"Aug 25, 2020","Me: *notices this webcomic* ""oh, this looks interesting.""
Me: *starts reading webcomic* ""hey, this is pretty good!""

Me: *finishes this week's episode* ""Holy bouncing baby blue mother f*cker, gimme some coins so I can read more of this sh*t!!"""
4,"Aug 25, 2020",Would love if the people who have read this already don’t post spoilers — please! Let everyone else discover this for the first time the same way you got to enjoy it :)
4,"Aug 25, 2020","if I were there, I would have just gone ahead and looked for a mosquito or cockroach to kill! 😅 it aught to count right? 😅😅 They didn't specify that the ""living organism"" has to be a human! "
4,"Aug 25, 2020",Tbh I would have been hyped if this happens to me irl like my life is so boring 
4,"Aug 24, 2020","the survival game summons the basic animal instinct in humans. kill the weak, outwit the strong to survive. this webtoon grabbed me by the heart for real."
4,"Aug 24, 2020",What if at the end of this webtoon the apocalypse starts.....
4,"Aug 24, 2020","SPECULATION, NOT SPOILERS: Well, good thing it said to kill 'living beings' and not specifically humans. There was that little boy with cicadas in Chapter 1, so at least SOME of them may survive without having to kill each other (which, I mean, come on Jihye. We're surrounded by bugs and insects. It really wasn't necessary to kill a classmate 🙄). "
4,"Aug 24, 2020",Honestly I'm surprised Dokja remembers stuff from chapters published 10 years ago 🤣
4,"Aug 24, 2020",cam here for the coin thingy but it looks soo interesting!!! Can't wait for an update!!
4,"Aug 24, 2020","I am sorry, I know that this doesn't have anything to do with the comic but.....SOOOOOO Many memes and vines are running through my mind as I read this story. I mean, I'm hooked, and I feel like this is gonna be one of my favorite Webcomics but like, the memes and vines. I cant help it! I'm a early 2000 baby."
4,"Aug 24, 2020",I'm just thinking of how sweet home just ended and came here because this is soo creepy. Like sweet home ended right now and we have a new story like this with monster apocalypse coming true and I can't help but feel scared
4,"Aug 24, 2020",oooh what if this webtoon became.....REALITY 😱😱😱 EVERYONE PAY ATTENTION TO THIS SO WE CAN SURVIVEEEE
4,"Aug 24, 2020",I just got war flash back from the solo leveling. And I just realise the author is has the same art style as solo leveling
4,"Aug 23, 2020","Didn’t that kid have a container of bugs, just kill them "
4,"Aug 23, 2020","Epic Story Man... this is literally not just a common and a same odd story, I like as new authors are coming with unique ideas and stories.... WELL DONE!!!.. "
4,"Aug 23, 2020",Imagine reading over 3000 episodes yet still remembering the details of what happens in the earlier chapters. MC has some eidetic memory haha.
4,"Aug 23, 2020","kill a living organism... doesn’t necessarily mean killing a human, right? you could kill a plant and it would still count. it’s just shows the cruel violence that hides behind civilized minds, i guess."
4,"Aug 22, 2020",I just realised - it says they have to kill a living organism right? What about the box of insects that little kid had? Insects are living organisms just kill one of them.
4,"Aug 22, 2020",I've read the novel and I'm so excited to see how the character designs will be for the characters later on 🥺
4,"Aug 22, 2020",My thoughts: BRUH KILL THE COCKROACHES REMBER THE COCKROACHES THAT KID HAD IN THE FIRST CHAPTER
4,"Aug 22, 2020","The dokkaebi is so disturbing, tho..."
4,"Aug 22, 2020",ok looks like I'm never gonna finish a webtoon again
4,"Aug 22, 2020","What if WE'RE the omniscient readers, and once this webtoon ends, we have to prepare for the apocalypse.."
4,"Aug 22, 2020",bich this is ganna be good.And should I read the web novel?
4,"Aug 22, 2020",i would have already killed someone 👁️👄👁️
4,"Aug 22, 2020",Are you willing to throw away your humanity to survive and become strong. JESUS CHRIST!! This is gonna be a top series.
4,"Aug 21, 2020",I'm already past chapter 18 but I'll still heart chapter 4-18 in here even tho I already read it to help the author.. (: 
4,"Aug 21, 2020",Where did that kid’s cockroaches go?
4,"Aug 21, 2020","Idk if this counts as a spoiler or nah but I saw someone complained about it before so I just wanna say, there might be some misleading scene but dont expect any romance for the mc or you might get dissapointed like that one person 👌🏻"
4,"Aug 20, 2020",I'm expecting at least 3000 episodes of this webtoon... Just saying 😆💛😆
4,"Aug 20, 2020",When the guy touched the invisible wall I thought he had super powers😫
4,"Aug 20, 2020","Umm.. Hello? Kill the grasshoppers maybe? You know, the grasshoppers that the kid had? "
4,"Aug 20, 2020","Girl: Kills person. Me: wait, why didn't she just wash her hands and kill the bacteria?"
4,"Aug 20, 2020","i didnt red the novel nor did i fastpass, this is just a question which is spinning in my head : the quest is ""one living organism"" and in a previous chapter a boy had a box full of living insects, so wont the quest be fullfilled if one person kills one bug? it does not ask to kill another human, only a living beeing...but maybe thats just me checking 4 a loophole..."
4,"Aug 20, 2020",can they make this into an anime like now?! this story line is awesome!
4,"Aug 20, 2020",Just kill a bug lol
4,"Aug 20, 2020",That creature is so cute ahhh I wanna hug it even though that might kill me....
4,"Aug 20, 2020","BTW, it was said to kill a 'living organism', and not to actually kill a real person, so couldn't that girl just search for an ant, or like some insect or fly in that classroom and kill it???"
4,"Aug 19, 2020",I created an account just for this
4,"Aug 19, 2020",After hearing that Home sweet home is ending this is exactly the comic I need to read
4,"Aug 19, 2020",it'd be ironic if this started only getting one view lmao
4,"Aug 19, 2020",I still cannot believe that that innocent looking creature is a monster. 대꼬비 - _ -

4,"Mar 10, 2022",just casually re-reading this to make sure I've liked all the episodes 
4,"Nov 20, 2021",they didn’t say kill humans so couldn’t they kill a bug or something ?
4,"Nov 2, 2021",I bet we're going to see that girl Jihye Lee again
4,"Oct 30, 2021",dokkebi ? more like DOKKABYE CAUSE YALL BOUTA SAY GOODBYE
4,"Oct 15, 2021",They said living organism so why not kill the cockroaches shown last chapter? 🧐
4,"Sep 21, 2021","is the goblin a living organism? he's my first pick to kill lol. also can't we just kill bacteria with a lysol wipe? plus there was the box full of insects, easy targets.... everything in this scenario is designed to suggest killing other people, but the people on the train are not even looking for loopholes or ways to resist..."
4,"Sep 17, 2021",I'm just rereading after some months but damn i think i got goosebumps all over my body even my head lol. This is the effect this manhwa do huh
4,"Aug 12, 2021",DANGNRONPA DANGANRONPA DANGANRONPA
4,"Jul 2, 2021",nice! reminds me of solo levelling
4,"Jul 2, 2021",Imagine you find yourself in a Webtoon but you're lying on the ground with red paint.
4,"Jun 14, 2021",Wasn't there a kid with a container full of crickets on the train? Couldn't some people just kill those? Though...there probably isn't enough bugs in there for everyone 😶
4,"Jun 10, 2021","if it would be me, I would have instantly sanitized my hands to kill all the microbes on my hand to complete the mission."
4,"May 28, 2021",Nooooo Jihye-ah! Imagining the survivor guilt she's feeling right now makes me tear up 😭
4,"May 18, 2021",this somehow reminds me of sweet home..?
4,"May 14, 2021","what about the kid with all the bugs...? Still reading, but its _any_ organism."
4,"May 1, 2021","Does no one have hand sanitizer? Kill millions of bacteria and live, you psychopaths!"
4,"Apr 30, 2021",Hungergames x the purge lol 🤣
4,"Apr 29, 2021",Lick your arm and swallow. Your stomach acid will kill lots of the bacteria that naturally live on your skin. *Boom* killed an organism.
4,"Apr 29, 2021",That detail in Jihye Lee's face.. I just now noticed. This webtoon really is a masterpiece 
4,"Apr 29, 2021",Umm do flies count as a kill? Bc I’m pretty sure I’d be a goner
4,"Apr 28, 2021",I came back here to say that if my life ever depends on remembering the details of a book I read I'm probably going to just accept my death while fangirling. I don't remember squat about diddly. 
4,"Apr 28, 2021",So a white puff ball is forcing murder 
4,"Apr 27, 2021","There was those grasshoppers earlier , they can just kill those "
4,"Apr 26, 2021",haha... i’m not sleeping tonight. 😀
4,"Apr 21, 2021",it said living organisms..not humans..
4,"Apr 11, 2021",I'd start looking for cockroaches or flies or something like that
4,"Mar 30, 2021",Why not just kill a fly or other insect? Those are living organisms as well right?
4,"Mar 26, 2021",KILL THE KID’S COCKROACHES THE THING SAID LIVING ORGANISM IM SO ANNOYED AAAAAAAAAAAAA
4,"Mar 24, 2021",Ngl this gives me a lot of danganronpa vibes 
4,"Mar 23, 2021",Sooo he is in a reverse isekai😂
4,"Mar 21, 2021",he is so amazing lol how could he remember what happened ten years ago in the novel 😌 i couldnt even remember the beginning of a webtoon i read 2 months ago
4,"Mar 2, 2021","I wonder if you could just put on some hand sanitizer and kill the bacteria on your hands or smth? I mean, bacteria are living organisms."
4,"Feb 3, 2021",why am i laughing? what the hell is wrong with me?!! XD
4,"Feb 2, 2021",It's scary to think that this could happen in the real world. If you just convince a focused group of people then there's a good chance that you could get them to kill each other.
4,"Jan 29, 2021",Not me reading this instead of doing school work.
4,"Jan 22, 2021",THE BUGS!!! Kill the bugs!!!
4,"Jan 12, 2021",Shiii she kinda hot tho 😏😏
4,"Dec 21, 2020",kill the insect!! 
4,"Dec 15, 2020",Can they kill the bugs the kid had a couple chapters back? It doesn't have to be necessarily human right? They stated living organism? 
4,"Nov 27, 2020","woah, the world is ending and people are still being selfish and rude, that's people for ya... "
4,"Nov 10, 2020",This reminds me of tower of god
4,"Oct 21, 2020","Kinda dumb aren’t they? It said a life form, that didn’t nessessarily mean it had to be sentient or sapient... just spit on the floor!"
4,"Oct 19, 2020",Kill the motherfucking cockroaches!!! THE LITTLE BOY HAD COCKROACHES OR GRASSHOPPERS IN A BOX!!! USE YOUR BRAINSSS😂 this is giving me anxiety 
4,"Oct 19, 2020",KILL. AN. ANT. ITS A LIVING ORGANISM 
4,"Oct 17, 2020",kill a bug. or use hand sanitizer and kill germs. 
4,"Oct 16, 2020","this is bout to stress me out lol and Dokja ..I'm pretty sure ""he"" is you. Also; it never specified it had to be a person. ""living organism"" is a pretty broad spectrum. if you had some hand sanitizer you could have hundreds of kills in 15 to 30 seconds."
4,"Oct 16, 2020",Shit Just Got NON FICTION 😳
4,"Oct 16, 2020",so he's waiting for the main character to appear. Not knowing that he's the main character. nice 👍
4,"Oct 15, 2020","""living organisms"" kill a bug, a plant, idk, there must be smth"
4,"Oct 14, 2020",Fun fact about me: my friend asked me what i would do in the apocalypse :D (zombie btw) and now we have a plan we’ve been planning for 5 bc we don’t see each other every day 
4,"Oct 14, 2020",wow your drawing skills are way too excellent .😰
4,"Oct 14, 2020",...I think I forgot how to blink
4,"Oct 12, 2020","Seems like a decent story, but I don't care for the endless buildup. It's obvious that the only way to survive is to start killing. Start by killing the bugs in that kids container."
4,"Oct 10, 2020",Okay Author.... I decided to read this webtoon even if it last until 3150 chapters.... who knows 2020 might just be the first phase of the Earth that was heading towards destruction and apocalypse
4,"Sep 21, 2020",Just find a cockroach XD
4,"Sep 21, 2020","Ok ok so why does it have to be humans? It said ""living organisms"". There are living organisms in the air that die every second. It doesn't mean just humans...Now I understand the panic but you shouldn't kill anyone unless there is a valid reason. Why not try and kill the beast itself? It's forcing the wrong doing. It would be stupid but it might catch it off guard."
4,"Sep 17, 2020","yall, the crickets that boy had were living organisms, I know for a fact most people dont mind killing bugs"
4,"Sep 14, 2020",When putting one under the overwhelming pressure of knowing that they can’t be rescued when they’re on the verge of dying is what makes a great story 😌🙌
4,"Sep 11, 2020",This is seriously every readers' dream and nightmare in one big unholy mess. 
4,"Sep 9, 2020",heck this is so--- 👌
4,"Sep 3, 2020",Battla royal......
4,"Sep 1, 2020",Where can we find it completed?
4,"Aug 30, 2020",Just KILL A SPIDER!!! ITS AN EVIL LIVING ORGANISM!!!
4,"Aug 28, 2020","Curse the day I called you cute doiki ,you literally scared the shit out of me "
4,"Aug 28, 2020","So serila killers survive, right?"
4,"Aug 28, 2020",This is so exciting! 
4,"Aug 28, 2020","You know, You know...I hear ""It's Okay. Jihye. Kill me"". Our Maritime War God Lee Jihye is good. I love Pure Steel Lee Hyeonseong, Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon~( ´ ∀ `)ノ～ ♡ Moonlight Empress Yoo Sangah. Ugliest King Kim Dokja. "
4,"Aug 28, 2020",If you just need to kill a living organism why don’t you just get some hand sanitizer kill bacteria on hands
4,"Aug 28, 2020",Does it mean any organism? Like if there was a bug in the compartment you could step on it and you’d be good? 😅
4,"Aug 27, 2020",OMG lol just kill like some insect or sth you dont actually have to kill a person.....
4,"Aug 27, 2020","I would just choose to die.I'm just wondering though, is ""co-killing"" allowed? Or is it just one per individual?"
4,"Aug 27, 2020",I would try to find a bug and killIt
4,"Aug 26, 2020","Where is a flee, fly, mosquito or ant when you need one?"
4,"Aug 26, 2020",This looks so good! I admit I originally came here for the free coins but damn this story is so interesting!!
4,"Aug 26, 2020","I would have just killed a ant or something, like those are living or a plant"
4,"Aug 26, 2020",am i the only one getting danganronpa vibes here?
4,"Aug 26, 2020",THE KID WITH THE BUGS- KILL THE BUGS TO LIVE

4,"Aug 26, 2020",she just murdered her friend like that???
4,"Aug 26, 2020",I'm sensing that this is going to have some serious SAO vibes
4,"Aug 26, 2020",Bro it only said to kill a living organism not a human they could've  just killed some ant or smh xD dAm Webtoon you had to do that to them xD Anyways I enjoyed reading this 
4,"Aug 26, 2020",it said organism not directly humans. they couldve killed a bug to live and crap tf wrong with people 
4,"Aug 25, 2020",bacteria is a living thingget some sanitisers ffs
4,"Aug 25, 2020","OKAY SUPPORT!! ASDFGDHDJFJ I JUST HOPE THIS WEBTOON WILL NOT CONSIST 3,149 EPISODES TOO OR I MIGHT JUST 😐"
4,"Aug 25, 2020",This reminds of Home Sweet Home.
4,"Aug 25, 2020","It said living organism. Quick, somebody find a roach!"
4,"Aug 25, 2020",Wtffffff??????? This is intense but I’m loving it author!!!!
4,"Aug 25, 2020",I’m astonished that it took him 10 years tho 
4,"Aug 25, 2020","Think about this. “Sanga, stay calm. Sanga, you’ve played the game the development team is currently working on, right? You know, the one where only a handful of people survive the apocalypse. ... Think of it this way. We’re part of that game now...”  Hmm 🤔 I think you may need to increase your diplomacy “stay calm” skills a bit."
4,"Aug 25, 2020","Be the change you want to see in the world. You are the protagonist, dumbo"
4,"Aug 25, 2020",bro I hope this has 3000 eps lol

4,"Aug 24, 2020",bro the subway always be having the most bugs i would be  looking in every damn corner to kill them he said ANYYYY living organism!!!! Key Word: ANYYYY
4,"Aug 24, 2020","so cant they kill insects? it said kill living organisms, not humans. also this comic is amazing"
4,"Aug 24, 2020",petition for this to be an anime !!!
4,"Aug 24, 2020",!!! The insects in that kids box in the beginning of the series! And I bet the character he’s waiting to appear is the main guy who must be himself!!
4,"Aug 24, 2020",it says kill an organism. I'm sure they can just kill an insect.
4,"Aug 24, 2020",MC: Asking why the supporting character appeared before the main character. || Me: YOU'RE THE MAIN CHARACTER.
4,"Aug 24, 2020",""" He "" hasn't appeared bcoz that ""He"" is YOU! I guess the author has thanked u by making u the protagonist of this story! "
4,"Aug 24, 2020","Just rub some hand sanitizer, that will kill some bacteria. They count as living organisms right?"
4,"Aug 24, 2020",I'd kill a mosquito 🦟 😒

I loved the cliffhanger on this episode WHICH tempted me to read the novel, and honestly, this is soon gonna get VERY interesting.

4,"Aug 21, 2020","Ok, it’s official. I’m reading the novel."
4,"Aug 21, 2020",Wouldn’t it be really cool if this webtoon had 3000 eps?
4,"Aug 21, 2020",I'm getting hyped up now!! I can say this webtoon is going to be a big hit!!!!! It will blow away everyone's mind. Hungrily waiting for the next episode!!!
4,"Aug 21, 2020",WHY DID I WASTE MY FREE COINS!! I SHOULD HAVE USED THEM FOR THIIISSSSS
4,"Aug 20, 2020","This is NOT a spoiler, as I haven't read the novel yet, but what if the guy that was supposed to come was Dokja?? Like he's the MC of the story he read?? Cause the writer of TWSA said that the story wouldn't happen if it weren't for him. Idk, that theory just crossed my mind when he referred to ""him""."
4,"Aug 20, 2020",I predict him using the bugs that kid had on that container please let me be right 😣😣😣
4,"Aug 20, 2020",the characters are a bit different than i imagined when i read the novel but overall it is really great art .
4,"Aug 20, 2020","As a reader of the web novel, this is seriously HYPE >< It's so awesome to see what the characters look like"
4,"Aug 20, 2020","I started reading the novel recently, (ch. 61) and I’m so hyped for this. ꒰⑅ ॣ•͈૦•͈ ॣ꒱໊꒳ᵒ꒳ᵎᵎᵎ"
4,"Aug 20, 2020",this is going to be huge 
4,"Aug 20, 2020","wouldn't killing bugs/plants, etc, work too ?"
4,"Aug 20, 2020",You know what would be good if there was 3000 episodes of this😁
4,"Aug 20, 2020",If you type this online it’s up to chapter 18 WEBTOON is on 3/4 
4,"Aug 20, 2020",wow it's already a 10 from me
4,"Aug 20, 2020",can anybody explain what everyone talking about in the comment section? I am just so clueless.☹️☹️☹️please can anybody!?
4,"Aug 20, 2020",wait this is a novel adaptation 
4,"Aug 20, 2020",i guess we should be thankfull of webtoon. they dont kill us or make us kill eachother to get us paid content.
4,"Aug 20, 2020",so then... is this comic planning on running for 10 years too?
4,"Aug 20, 2020",Hey we have also hit the paywall... who I have to kill to unlock more chapters? !
4,"Aug 20, 2020",It's an honor to read a manwha that will be ICONIC in the next few years like Tower of God and God of Highschool also NOBLESSE 🥰❤️❤️
4,"Aug 20, 2020",what if the man in long black coat is Dokja himself??...woah!! this webtoon is soooo awesome...thanks a lot!!
4,"Aug 20, 2020","I don't get why everyone jumped to the conclusion of killing each other when it said ""living organism"" and not ""humans"".Like everyone I asked regarding this first thought of ants and insects as well. It's such an easy thing to think of especially in society that's relatively peaceful. I just find that part so bizarre. "
4,"Aug 20, 2020",OMG this is so amazing! I can't wait to see what happens next!!!
4,"Aug 20, 2020",this reminds me of solo leveling 
4,"Aug 20, 2020",For anyone who doesn't know this webtoon is based off a webnovel called Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. Its a great read highly recommended.
4,"Aug 19, 2020","for all you newbies, the art is done by the same guy who did art for SOLO LEVELING."
4,"Aug 19, 2020",solo leveling vibes :)
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Dokja: ....but why hasn't HE appeared yet Me: bcuz its YOU 
4,"Aug 19, 2020",OMHHGGG YESSSS IT FINALLY GOT A WEBTOON PPL WHEN IT GETS AN ANIME U WILL WITNESS THE MOST EPIC MOMENTS OF ANIME HISTORY.

4,"Aug 19, 2020",Gotta wait 7 days for next ep O.o
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Nothing like a end of the world survival WEBTOON during an pandemic.....
4,"Aug 19, 2020",GUESS IMMA BE SPENDING ALL MY FAST PASSES ON THIS
4,"Aug 19, 2020","Now, he is living his own life bish 😎"
4,"Aug 19, 2020",can't you just kill a plant?  technically a living organism 
4,"Aug 19, 2020",... Is he the character that he's waiting for??
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Omg the MC dude is prob gonna be the “he” or the guy who is supposed to appear but hasn’t yet
4,"Aug 19, 2020",When your the protagonist but not the protagonist of the protagonist 
4,"Aug 19, 2020",is this series also going end at episode 3149?? woah
4,"Aug 19, 2020","ugh imagining this as an anime, what a wild one that would be 😣"
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Dokkaebi is reminding me of Monokuma...
4,"Aug 19, 2020","he said organism, doesn’t have to be a human, there might be a bug or smth"
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Does anyone remember the kid with the bugs in a container. Bugs are a living organism and so if you kill a bugs you are good.
4,"Aug 19, 2020",10 years worth of reading...and he is able to remember the first chapter of the webnovel and names like a beast. I can't even remember what I had for lunch yesterday.
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Why not release all the available episodes already? There's already 18 episodes online
4,"Aug 19, 2020","Gosh, this chapter give me chills"
4,"Aug 19, 2020",This gonna be a legend equal to Tower of God
4,"Aug 19, 2020",THIS REALLY REMINDS ME OF DICE
4,"Aug 19, 2020","I remember on the 2nd episode, there is one kid on the train, he carries a jar of bugs...I'd get one of those bugs and kill it to survive.."
4,"Aug 19, 2020","This reminds me of Solo Leveling with its art style, and the story seems really interesting! I can't wait for more!"
4,"Aug 27, 2020",how is it possible to continuously have chills reading this? this is absolutely insane and I can't stop reading
4,"Aug 19, 2020",I'M SO GLAD THAT THE WEB NOVEL IS FINALLY TURNED INTO A WEBTOON. 10/10 BEST READ I'M SO EXCITED!!!
4,"Aug 19, 2020",I have been waiting for this! Let the chaos commence! I will donate 100 coins as the MC’s plot interesting...
4,"Sep 21, 2022","shoot guysas much as i luved princess and princes and red roses, i'm addicted to this
this is just so sick!!"
4,"Jul 24, 2022",I still can't believe it's finally on webtoon. I'll be liking and commenting on each chapter to support the author.
4,"Jul 15, 2022","this is so good, why did I just discover this now. ;-; "
4,"Jun 18, 2022",things are getting so Interesting 🤩
4,"Jun 5, 2022","I wonder how many of those children belonged to someone in the train. I don't think there was anyone in that cabin or someone would have said somthing, but in another one."
4,"Apr 21, 2022",The only thing that is annoying me about this episode is that the main character knows exactly what is going on because he read the story but he till chose to stand there doing nothing but think “oh I can’t believe Twsa is becoming reality”. He has not done anything despite seeing people get killed which could’ve maybe been prevented if he tried.
4,"Apr 20, 2022",better read this webtoon before it becomes a reality
4,"Feb 20, 2022",IM OBSESSED!! AS A NEW READER THE GRAPHICS ARE AMAZING! IF THEY MADE THIS AN ANIME I WOULD BE OBSESSED
4,"Feb 18, 2022",Dont you just hate it when you are reading a novel and it becomes real? So annoying 🙄
4,"Feb 18, 2022",you guys need to find some bugs
4,"Jan 6, 2022",Where’s that kid with the bugs
4,"Dec 4, 2021","""This is not just some joke like terrorism"" So terrorist attack is a........ joke?"
4,"Nov 16, 2021",I want to know what he was given thats supposed to help him survive...
4,"Nov 6, 2021","Living organism is just a multicellular living thing (fungus, plants, animals, germs etc). Couldn't you just pull some hand sanitizer out and kill some bacteria? Plants are also living organisms so couldn't the people that are currently playing this game outside pull out some grass? Why was the first thought in the High School girls head ""Living organism? better kill my classmates"" 😂"
4,"Oct 14, 2021",Is the protagonist of the novel supposed to be our current mc? But last chapter there were two people ahh this is so interesting TuT
4,"Oct 13, 2021",ITS YOU YOU BITCCHHHH *getting ahead of myself because why not* 
4,"Oct 7, 2021",Just kill an insect.
4,"Aug 28, 2021","BRO THIS IS INTENSE. Oh man oh man oh man I THINK ITS HIM THAT NEEDS TO APPEAR! Aghhhh im on the edge of my seat. Jihye is INTENSE, but hinestly, they were all gonna die anyway so 🤷🏼‍♀️."
4,"Aug 27, 2021",i got goosebumps when jihye appeared omg
4,"Aug 26, 2021","But they could kill a fly or a mosquito, right?"
4,"Aug 5, 2021",crickets guys. living orgaaaanismmmm.
4,"Aug 3, 2021",Day 3 voicing all the characters 
4,"Aug 2, 2021",This is so interesting! I'm hooked
4,"Jul 31, 2021","PLOT HOLE: in TWSA, the scene goes: in train cabin 3707, the protagonist (YJH) kills everyone to survive. cz he's the protag,  the writing is ofc centered around him. Dokja is in cabin 3807, a train car behind YJH. as u can see above, Dokja  is remembering quotes from TWSA that are describing his situation in train cabin 3807 perfectly rn. but why do those lines (""a dokkaebi w/antennae"", ""a litter of dead bodies in the subway cabin"", etc) even exist? *continued in reply"
4,"Jul 29, 2021","remember this comment, this novel/webtoon will get movie/series adaptation  at least 3-5 years after (since current ep is stil in ep 50+)"
4,"Jul 28, 2021",Bro what happened to the kid with the crickets? they could just kill a cricket and survive. Simple.
4,"Jul 25, 2021",oh no!
4,"Jul 22, 2021","If the scenario is to just kill an organism, you can technically kill a plant right? "
4,"Jul 22, 2021","How lucky. The MC could still recall what happened on the first chapter of the novel when in fact he has been reading it for 10 years while here I am, already forgotten all the lessons we discussed throughout the year 😭"
4,"Jul 6, 2021",This I can’t stop reading!!! What will he do?!
4,"Jul 5, 2021",AYYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAY
4,"Jun 30, 2021",I have a feeling that the guy on the first ep where dokja is fighting with a man is the main character that dokja questioning why he's not in the first scene. idk but they look alike hehe or maybe dokja is the main character 🤔
4,"Jun 10, 2021",This shit scary at night lol
4,"May 19, 2021",i would kill a lot of people
4,"May 18, 2021",imma assume because this creature is able to teleport and somewhat warp reality that its able to also create a false recording just to get people to act. Kinda like some danganronpa type stuff.
4,"May 12, 2021",just kill ome of thoes insects that kid on the train had earlier than evryone lives simple
4,"May 2, 2021",a Korean danganronpa?
4,"May 1, 2021",guys here is a spoiler this is one of the best comics on webtoon 
4,"May 1, 2021","rereading because of free coins, now I realize who the girl is."
4,"Apr 30, 2021","Is blue house a korean thing?Or is it just a joke on the whiye house?
I DONT UNDERSTAND, I AM AMERICAN!!!"
4,"Apr 29, 2021",There was no need for the girl to kill people. She could have just killed a fly buzzing around a room and if there weren’t any insects around just rip a PLANT from the ground JEEZ
4,"Apr 29, 2021",LET THE HUNGER GAMES BEGIN!
4,"Apr 29, 2021",What in the danganrompa- (I love this story) 
4,"Apr 29, 2021",Make this a SHOW! Omg I would die to watch it I’m so hyped up lol
4,"Apr 27, 2021","I'm sure there's any and cockroaches roaming around in that cart, do they not count as living organisms? Just squash one lmao"
4,"Apr 27, 2021",i think those people resist it for so long. Irl there are people who would kill someone right away when the mission screen pop up
4,"Apr 27, 2021",I'm feeling danganronpa vibe. (눈‸눈)
4,"Apr 27, 2021","The lockdown has made me go 'hand sanitizer, hand sanitizer' when it said at least one living organism - bacteria (unlike viruses) are living, no?"
4,"Apr 27, 2021",yeah um... I'm not really sure the police can solve this issue😐
4,"Apr 27, 2021",Is there a cat or dog or rat on the train? I know it’s a pet but better an animal than a human? Heck why not a plant since it said organism. 
4,"Apr 26, 2021","ok ya this is such a good story, why didn't I read this before"
4,"Apr 26, 2021",some hand sanitizer would be pretty nifty about now
4,"Apr 18, 2021",this is kinda like danganronpa
4,"Apr 15, 2021",I'm reading this again AND I LOVE IT SOOO MUCH  PDJDPSKFPWKRPRK IT'S LITERALLY SO AMAZING 
4,"Apr 15, 2021",they can kill a fly cause that is a living organism it didn't specify what organism
4,"Apr 13, 2021",Bro this story is so captivating for some reason its like im actually there
4,"Apr 13, 2021",If I was in this story it would be so bad cause I literally forget everything I read. Like I’ll love a story but still forget most of it. 
4,"Apr 7, 2021","comments: *talking about how there are obvious solutions the characters aren't doing, plot conveniences, etc. in the story* me: *desperately wanting to say that the future chapters explain things further but not wanting to spoil*"
4,"Mar 25, 2021",Dang it why do i always get to amazing webtoons late 
4,"Mar 16, 2021",my ass would've just asked to die
4,"Mar 15, 2021",wasnt there a kid with insects in a container? some ppl could probably kill those and have it counted towards the scenario
4,"Mar 12, 2021",I wonder when MC will actually start doing something
4,"Feb 26, 2021",Guys. Just. Just find a bug. Guarenteed rhat theres a bug in the subway like if you kill that that will count
4,"Feb 24, 2021",Or you could of killed a bug or something
4,"Feb 4, 2021",I’m all caught up on the series and I’m re-reading it cause it’s so good!!
4,"Jan 28, 2021",Jihye-ya ༼;´༎ຶ ۝ ༎ຶ༽
4,"Jan 27, 2021","this is kinda mix of sweet home and Alice in the borderland, like the game reminded me of aitb and the monster was sweet home, its quite interesting"
4,"Jan 21, 2021",OMG.... I’m starting to think that this story is a clue of how the world is going to end....😮you never know...
4,"Jan 21, 2021"," I would love to see this turned into a K-series like they did with Sweet Home, the story type and genre seems similar and I really loved the Sweet Home series "
4,"Jan 20, 2021",let's not read the comments... let's dive in knowing nothing 😂
4,"Jan 17, 2021",I am so excited and wow...dokja is so hot  and smart LV his character
4,"Jan 12, 2021",...living organism soooo hand sanitizer? germs?
4,"Jan 9, 2021","Well, no one has time to find an insect outside of the train with the reduced time limit, and now knowing that the cabins are sealed. Last chapter someone had a genius idea to use hand sanitizer to kill germs, hence an organism. "
4,"Jan 7, 2021",why does remind me of danganronpa 
4,"Jan 6, 2021",man that's some messed up stuff
4,"Dec 31, 2020",Just grab some hand sanitizer and kill 99.99% of those germs lol
4,"Dec 29, 2020",What happened to the White House did they paint it blue
4,"Dec 25, 2020",Welp ngl but I keep thinking why don't they just kill the boy's cockroaches in the earlier chapter
4,"Dec 24, 2020",what if they kill one of the bugs the kid had. that's a living organism. They didn't say humans in particular.
4,"Dec 23, 2020","Damn, having this kind of setting might be fun..."
4,"Dec 13, 2020",HOPE THIS'LL BECOME AN ANIME
4,"Dec 7, 2020","This is so dumb, they just said to kill a living organism, and bacteria are living organisms. Just wash your fricking hands, no need to get all lunatic about it."
4,"Dec 5, 2020","hey, it says to kill only a living organism..... right? so can't they just kill some insects like those krickets or even our cells are living organinsm if they just cut some cells out like skin doesn't then the mission will be complete?? Right guys 😅😅"
4,"Nov 27, 2020",jiggly puff from pokemon
4,"Nov 11, 2020","oh lol that ""This is not a drill"" meme; Oh wow we got the first survivor, quite brutal; geez just become the main character already bro;"
4,"Nov 7, 2020",can i ask if how many chapter does this novel have?? goshhhh it makes my blood alivee
4,"Nov 2, 2020",Are you telling me no one tried to touch the screen tho?
4,"Oct 30, 2020",I feel like im the dude casually reading a genocide or whatever webcomic and kinda having a small smile and laughing while reading and thinking about if this happened. also I know most people think the little thing might be scary but in both forms I find it either cute or cool. hehe 😅 
4,"Oct 22, 2020",I didn't know Monokuma got a makeover
4,"Oct 18, 2020","anyone else thinking they should start smashing bugs or something? it just says ""living organisms."" doesn't that include bugs and insects? 😅"
4,"Oct 17, 2020","It said organism, so I can't stop thinking that they get to live if they kill an insect or something haha"
4,"Oct 17, 2020",this webtoon the same as Dice
4,"Oct 17, 2020",Pretty sure I saw a roach in episode one. Could someone please step on it already?
4,"Oct 16, 2020","um, humans aren't the only living organisms..."
4,"Oct 15, 2020",Quick go find a fly or something!

tower of god, God of high school, weak Hero , then This

hats off
👌👌"
4,"Aug 25, 2020","I came here for the coins, I remained for the story. I surely didn't expect that I'll be this interested in this story."
4,"Aug 25, 2020",fhooking find an ant or a mosquito and kill it....
4,"Aug 25, 2020",Take my redeemed free coins
4,"Aug 25, 2020",The term organism is very loose...got to look for loopholes
4,"Aug 25, 2020","finished the novel a few days ago, then saw this and started immediatly."
4,"Aug 25, 2020",waiting for the next one with crossed fingers it will be better than or just as good as this one!
4,"Aug 25, 2020","If TWSA was a real comic I'd read it only if it didn't become real 😂 just because there's 3,149 eps. "
4,"Aug 25, 2020",Reminds me of Dangenropa.o.o
4,"Aug 25, 2020",quick question is there anywhere else i can read this? because i really enjoyed the last few.
4,"Aug 25, 2020",Okay literally in love with these. I am so excited about other episodes
4,"Aug 25, 2020",if they have to kill a living organism they don't need to kill other humans. if there are flies or other insects around they can kill them instead.
4,"Aug 25, 2020",I love this comic keep up the good work author I'll be waiting for the next one 😀
4,"Aug 25, 2020",They didn't specify what the living being should be.So wouldn't it be alright to kill the insects that the kid was holding in the train? As long as it was alive.
4,"Aug 25, 2020",Wow I'm already hooked!!! The art and story is super good so far 😍😍
4,"Aug 25, 2020",I’m confused why don’t they just kill a bug or plant 
4,"Aug 25, 2020",Why do I feel like Lieutenant Lee is going to die 😭
4,"Aug 25, 2020",WEBTOON are you setting us up for something👀is there something you would like to share with us👀👀
4,"Aug 25, 2020",since the only requirement is to kill a living organism couldn't he kill one of the kid's bugs?
4,"Aug 25, 2020",because he is you stupid
4,"Aug 24, 2020",cant they just kill a plant or something or do i have my science all wrong
4,"Aug 24, 2020",y’all have to stick with this webtoon. i read to ch18 and i can promise that this will suck u right in. hold onto your wallets lol
4,"Aug 24, 2020",ah yes the REAL battle royle
4,"Aug 24, 2020",just find a bug and kill it! it's a living organisms so i think that counts🤭
4,"Aug 24, 2020",I read this on a website it has 18 chapters  here's the website     mangafast     .net
4,"Aug 24, 2020",I don't mean to come pair this amazing webtoon to anything but doesn't that horned demon thing remind you of a certain black and white bear?
4,"Aug 24, 2020",im already at chapter 17 or 18 but im gonna reread it xD
4,"Aug 24, 2020","This actually isn't really the kind of genre I usually like to read, but it really hooked me"
4,"Aug 24, 2020","This webtoon is to prepare us for the end, keep reading it if you don't want your head to splattered 😂"
4,"Aug 24, 2020",jihye can step on me and ill say thanks
4,"Aug 24, 2020","Dokkei kinda giving me Monokuma vibes, and even the ""You have to kill at least one person to survive"" thing sounds like what Monokuma would and has been saying for the past, how many series of Danganronpa now?, my best is Trigger Happy Havoc, I don't why, I just like the name, it's catchy 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽"

4,"Aug 24, 2020",Victory royale

4,"Aug 24, 2020",This is the literal version of “Novel to film”
4,"Aug 24, 2020",can't they kill the crickets that the little boy has? 
4,"Aug 24, 2020",this is reminding me of a mixture of the anime dangonranpa and the korean drama train to busan 
4,"Aug 24, 2020",Wait it says living organism so can’t they get some hand sanitizer and kill some bacteria...?
4,"Aug 24, 2020","So this is basically danganronpa, but broader and more brutal. Noice."
4,"Aug 24, 2020","I would have looked on the ground for a bug or something because he said a LIVING ORGANISM, not necessarily a person's life."
4,"Aug 24, 2020",i like this series alot already even tho i started reading this i can tell the author(s) put alot of work in this and im gonna read it alot more

4,"Aug 21, 2020",It just says they need to kill any living organism. Wasn't there a kid with some bugs in a container on his lap? Couldn't they kill those? 
4,"Aug 21, 2020",When you get through the first scenario by squashing an insect.
4,"Aug 21, 2020","This is the fourth webtoon that has made me jump in the air while reading it. If this continues, this is going to be one of the best comics ever like GOD OF HIGHSCHOOL and TOWER OF GOD..... And someday this might even turn into an Anime. Man I love this, the concept is just past my imagination. As a writer I wish I could have found this idea first 😂😂😂"
4,"Aug 21, 2020","He said a living organism so kill a bug, right? "
4,"Aug 21, 2020",I want this animated

4,"Aug 20, 2020",they just have to kill any living organism right so why not kill bugs like flys ants they are also living organisms 
4,"Aug 20, 2020",Imagine the inception That this will have 3k episodes. Then when you read it all. Just wait until you go to That subway :) 
4,"Aug 20, 2020","y'all, if you haven't read the webnovel do NOT search images in Google. people do not care about spoiling it, and I've seen spoilers already when I searched and I was just looking at pictures. do not make the same mistake I have cause I haven't read it yet eighther."
4,"Aug 20, 2020",I’m gonna take a guess it’s the hugs he’ll kill to survive; since it didn’t specify humans and I remember the kid with the net and bunch of bugs! I haven’t read it but that’s what I’m predicting owo
4,"Aug 20, 2020",Looks like thissll be on a loong run... Lovin it alredy💜💜
4,"Aug 20, 2020",I like how he points out who's gonna be a character or not.
4,"Aug 20, 2020",I saw the anouncement on reaper scans that webtoon took the rights to translate from them but I never actually though. this sucks tho cuz now I know what's gonna happen
4,"Aug 20, 2020",You know what’s the most surprising thing about this whole event. It’s that he can remember what happened in a story he read from 10 years ago while I can’t even remember what I ate couple days ago
4,"Aug 20, 2020",It's 7pm but those girls still have classes? Damn Korea is brutal

4,"Aug 19, 2020",Where is the kid with the cricket bucket??? 
4,"Aug 19, 2020","The translation seems pretty faithful..also, those who will say its like solo leveling and looks like solo leveling.. the story is quite different actually.. Also, the art looks similar and Dokja looks like Sung Jin woo because it is being drawn by the same people. If you like SL you will definitely enjoy ORV as well 😄. You will not regret it ❤️ so far its a very faithful adaptation~"
4,"Aug 19, 2020",if this was actually on web novel I could read 60 chapters a day and it would only take me 2 months to complete all 3149 episodes thanks to me having 20 Google accounts
4,"Aug 19, 2020","If you are enjoying this please read the original novel's official translation on Webnovel too, so you can support the author singshong even more"
4,"Aug 19, 2020","It says ""living organism"" so does that mean it can be animals, bug etc. ?"

4,"Aug 19, 2020",kim dokja company let's go!!!!!!!!!

4,"Aug 19, 2020","I predict that people will kill the bugs from the previous episode, because that will count as a living organism right?!"
4,"Aug 19, 2020",My wallets going on a diet. I have never been so sure of Anything in my LIFE🤗😃
4,"Aug 19, 2020","Kill an organism, then kill the crickets the little boy caught. Bugs are living organisms."

4,5 days ago,They just need to kill any living organism? Just pass around some hand sanitizer.
4,"Oct 2, 2022",i love weak but overly smart main characters. let's see where this is going....
4,"Oct 2, 2022","as said, kill the crickets."
4,"Sep 22, 2022","Someone find a bug! Quick! Stink bugs are back, and invasive where I am! "
4,"Sep 19, 2022",Let the Squid Games begin.
4,"Sep 3, 2022","in a situation like this I feel like I'll be the only one cheering like ""as she should Queen"" and mink the person next to me"
4,"Sep 1, 2022",Creepy af

4,"Aug 7, 2022",WHen they called terrorism a joke 😬
4,"Aug 6, 2022",Why does this manga remaind me of Danganronpa?
4,"Aug 2, 2022",manhwa is always creative and interesting!!
4,"Aug 2, 2022",bro.. living organism kill an ant or sth

4,"Jul 27, 2022","My sister suggested this Webtoon to me earlier, this is getting really interesting as i read it hehe ^^ "

4,"Jul 17, 2022",anyone have disinfectant  just  kill the  germs
4,"Jul 12, 2022",I don't disobey my own morals just because someone might kill me.
4,"Jul 11, 2022",why the hell is he repeating the same lines ?

4,"Jul 5, 2022",I should have read this sooner...
4,"Jun 24, 2022","WOAH, THE STORY SEEMS INTERESTING"
4,"May 29, 2022","it seems like it's in your best interest to kill someone fast, that way no one should kill you because then the first death would be pointless and less people survive"
4,"May 16, 2022",main character doesn't know he's the main yet 😅
4,"May 4, 2022",Living organism…doesn’t say human so the crickets the boy was holding counts right?
4,"May 3, 2022","If you can kill any living organism then I guess it would work if they killed something like an ant, a plant or maybe cells? Maybe they could just try killing their own cells I don’t know "
4,"May 1, 2022","Third time re-reading and I’ve been telling myself over and over to post this comment and then forgetting, but isn’t there living organisms on your skin. Like just slap your arm and bam 1000000 living organisms killed"
4,"Apr 29, 2022",I feel bad for that girl that had to kill her class mate though...she was smart enough to know what she had to do but it's still sad..imagine you seeing everyone in your class head's explode and you have to kill someone you might be sitting next to 😭😭😭
4,"Apr 24, 2022","I mean, living organism could mean a lot of things, step on a bug and that would count, right? You scratch yourself and kill cells wouldn't that count?"
4,"Apr 16, 2022","He's been looking for the ""main lead"" but he didn't know he is the ""Main Lead""

4,"Mar 8, 2022",Nice plot. Where is the best site to read the novel?
4,"Mar 5, 2022","-requires to kill a living thing-goal does not specify a required level of complexity or even sentience
-in a classroom
-not one of them goes for hand sanitizer to kill 99.9% of germs.

sad."
4,"Mar 3, 2022","I would love to see this get a series, like on netflix"
4,"Feb 28, 2022",Legacy of the Webtoon Fans is shocked with the harsh reality
4,"Feb 24, 2022",So uh is everyone in the subway gonna have a subway PTSD afterwards?
4,"Feb 17, 2022",The art style is so good. Thank you awesome author
4,"Feb 13, 2022",I just finished the novel and I had to come back here to re-read this gem (人 •͈ᴗ•͈)
4,"Feb 5, 2022","Yo it said ""living organism"" right? Not necessarily a human so it can be the insect that the kid was keeping as shown in the past episode?? "
4,"Feb 1, 2022",Darn this is just too good!!!!

4,"Jan 15, 2022",maybe i’m stupid but couldn’t they just kill like.. bacteria?? 💀💀
4,"Jan 14, 2022","Bro just take out some hand sanitizer, and everyone lives "
4,"Jan 6, 2022",I wonder if solo leveling warrior will ever come to WEBTOON lol 
4,"Dec 23, 2021",reminds me of squid game 
4,"Dec 19, 2021",interesting
4,"Dec 19, 2021",wtf is a blue house 😂😂
4,"Dec 16, 2021",honestly i geuss killing someone as the first challenge would count as mercy for what will come
4,"Dec 10, 2021","ohhh, this kinda reminds me of the survivors who got sent into a parallel universe from -The Earth is Online novel-"
4,"Dec 6, 2021","so this is probably Danganronpa irl, but the different is that it's not just a highschool students. "
4,"Dec 6, 2021",It’s getting crazyyyyyy
4,"Nov 22, 2021","We just got to see his shadow, but ""he"" kinda makes me think of Dazai because of his clothes"
4,"Nov 13, 2021",it's feels like I have seen this kind of situation some were else(๑•﹏•)....... I-in in  my dreams😱😱
4,"Nov 10, 2021",I think the reason wht the other character is not appearing is because it is supposed to be him.  
4,"Nov 8, 2021",I wonder what the hell this Dokkebi thing is 
4,"Oct 31, 2021",that dokkadie thingy right there when i first saw him he's like the cutest thing on the earth but nopeeee he's ugly as hell
4,"Oct 26, 2021",Id let Jihye choke me
4,"Oct 19, 2021",Wait... this is just a guess but is Dokja the writer of TWSA?
4,"Oct 13, 2021","It said you have to k!ll 1 or more living organism in order to live,  There's no animals  , So more likely they have to kill each other.. Seems interesting.."
4,"Oct 11, 2021",this is fucked up
4,"Oct 9, 2021",Is this a similar experience to solo leveling? I'm really getting those vibes and I'm honestly really excited. 
4,"Oct 8, 2021",Just saw this now and I'm glad I could now put faces on the characters I've only just read before.
4,"Aug 26, 2021",Dojka/MC looks like Sung Jin Woo from Solo Leveling
4,"Aug 21, 2021",Well here come my anxiety attacks from thinking about situations like these actually happening haha……😅
4,"Aug 17, 2021",If they all just shit themselves they'll win. Humans have bacteria in their guts that die when exposed to air.
4,"Aug 10, 2021",he read the novel 10 years ago a d remembered heyongseyong lee (?) originally.appreared after the first scenario. damn this guy had good memory
4,"Aug 9, 2021","Can't you just wash your hands or kill a mosquito or something?, It says kill one or more living organisms so that's still technically correct no?"
4,"Aug 8, 2021",This is... If I was in this situation I would probably have a hard time staying alive.......
4,"Jul 30, 2021",This is interesting! 
4,"Jul 28, 2021",LOLOL

4,"Apr 30, 2021","Are there like, 2 main characters now? Cuz there was a fighting scene in a previous episode between Dokja and that other dude who is probably the original main character"
4,"Apr 29, 2021","I bet at the end of the world, the only survivors are WEBTOON readers, anime watchers and gamers bc guess what, we have the most experience through reading apocalyptic events 😐"
4,"Apr 29, 2021",When I started reading this webtoon I was like 🤨😑but now I’m in love with it!
4,"Apr 29, 2021",They need to suck it up and kill somebody 🙄
4,"Apr 29, 2021","I don't know about yall but if a floating black eyed goblin demon appeared and told me to kill something or else it'd kill me, after killing a bunch of other people, I'm gonna kill someone lmao"
4,"Apr 28, 2021",this kinda reminds me of W
4,"Apr 27, 2021","This some kind of Hunger Games sh*t or what? Note: Not trying to be rude, I honestly think this is amazing, but it reminds me of the Hunger Games movies 😂"
4,"Apr 27, 2021",So America has the White House and South Korea has the...Blue House?
4,"Apr 27, 2021",This is why you should carry hand sanitizer.
4,"Apr 27, 2021",that lieutenant sure has some big biddies 😫
4,"Apr 27, 2021",The blue house
4,"Apr 27, 2021",it didn't even take me a second and I started simping for the main character. Bruh I am hopeless
4,"Apr 27, 2021",U should not curse on ur remaining minute of life

4,"Apr 26, 2021",I can tell I’m about to read a crazy and exciting story 
4,"Apr 26, 2021",I call BS on the main character. I don't even remember what I had for dinner last night and you're telling me this man remembers chapter 1 scene 1 from a 10 year old manhwa??
4,"Apr 26, 2021","I'm scared,,,"
4,"Apr 26, 2021",THIS IS GIVING ME GOOSEBUMPS PLS BUT THATS NOT GONNA STOP ME FROM READING THIS. DAMN WISH THIS HAPPENS(?) KSKSKSKS
4,"Apr 15, 2021",I feel like he wrote the series 
4,"Apr 12, 2021",well this just got a whole lot more interesting
4,"Apr 11, 2021","""fun right?"""
4,"Apr 9, 2021",Anyone else really want to read three ways to survive the apocalypse 
4,"Apr 6, 2021",I think the soldier appeared at the 'wrong' time because he's not the main character. TWSA was written in the MC's POV so the order of events would be different for other characters. The MC was probably going to see the soldier after the first scenario hence the 'wrong' timing.
4,"Mar 16, 2021",mag papatayan hehehe i like it 
4,"Mar 10, 2021","if this happen in real life, i'll probably die earlier because i can't remember what happened on chapter 1 😭😭😭 i'm too forgetful lmao "
4,"Mar 2, 2021",This is a gem
4,"Mar 1, 2021",woww interesting mhmm i am starting to like this ehehhe😊😁
4,"Feb 25, 2021",Is anyone else getting Danganronpa vibes?
4,"Feb 25, 2021",I'm new to this and all I can think is kill one of those kid's bug he had in jar we saw earlier 😬
4,"Feb 24, 2021",why not use alcohol and clean ur hands 
4,"Feb 24, 2021",bruh step on a bug ._.
4,"Feb 17, 2021",Oh... I just remembered. Weren't there some insects in the kids jar in the previous episode or was it on episode 0? They're counted as living organisms right? I just thought it was odd that it was highlighted before. Maybe we'll find out next episode haha
4,"Feb 12, 2021",Shoulda just rubbed some isopropyl alcohol on their hands
4,"Feb 10, 2021","it said organisms and in the first chapter there was a kid on the subway with a cage of bugs, i reckon they'll kill off the bugs but not without some people dying first."
4,"Jan 14, 2021",I'm getting chills
4,"Jan 14, 2021",bruh i’m so hyped 😭
4,"Jan 14, 2021",Ah this series is getting spicy I'm getting into it the more I read it
4,"Jan 11, 2021",lol they can just kill a lice or an insect as long as its a living being
4,"Jan 10, 2021",good thing i no longer remember to much about the plot.  😂😂
4,"Jan 6, 2021",I LOVE IT ALREADY..LOVE YOU AUTHOR 
4,"Jan 2, 2021",thankyou!
4,"Jan 1, 2021",Yo dis is very familiar. Remember that movie the one with the daruma doll. It's so similar. I love it
4,"Dec 27, 2020",just kill the that insects... 
4,"Dec 26, 2020",just kill the bugs that the boy is holding in the previous eps
4,"Dec 24, 2020",someone told me it is actually a Korean novel!! 
4,"Dec 13, 2020","My god I’m literally shaking in excitement.....and it’s actually first time I hear about this novel, but it already got me shaken by how it started!"
4,"Dec 12, 2020",honestly i'd rather die than kill someone. Is only me who think like that?
4,"Dec 11, 2020",Frick I was trying to prepare myself for that ONE panel of the dokkaebi’s face .... 😱😅I wasn’t as scared as the first time I read at least 😂
4,"Dec 11, 2020",The art was so amazing even from the start. I am going to like this amazing story for sure. And also I can feel their fear while reading it. This is a game of survival. I am scared and quite reluctant to read it at first. But I am going to continue. 
4,"Dec 11, 2020",bruh I can feel their fear my hands are trembling
4,"Dec 10, 2020","That scene reminds me of when in Danganronpa despair arc, Junko was having the student council kill each other. "
4,"Dec 7, 2020",period queen she did that 😜
4,"Dec 5, 2020","you just kill something living, so find an ant! or claim that your antibodies are killing tons of bacteria all the time!"
4,"Dec 4, 2020",just kill an ant
4,"Nov 29, 2020","damn that's twisted, i like it"
4,"Nov 28, 2020",I take back what I said about having a different genre of story- heh
4,"Nov 28, 2020",Either kill or be killed
4,"Nov 27, 2020","Ok, I don't get it. Is there only one winner in each group or is everyone who kills someone in the group survivor? Like, if there's 26 people in a group and one half kills the other half, does that mean half that killed survived? Or do they have to kill each other until there's one left? "
4,"Nov 24, 2020",... they could have just stepped on a roach or something 
4,"Nov 23, 2020",just op...im gonna comm in every episode...its just op
4,"Nov 23, 2020",Gruesome...
4,"Nov 12, 2020",Danganronpa
4,"Nov 11, 2020",you still the best author and artist
4,"Nov 11, 2020",this is so badass it is awesome
4,"Nov 9, 2020","Looks like as if I've been reading again  ""AS THE GOD'S WILL"".. Every level, there is only one survivor.. But the case was all the participants was highschool students of diff. Countries ❤️"
4,"Nov 4, 2020","Oh, this is great!"
4,"Oct 30, 2020",darapora feelins
4,"Oct 29, 2020",Couldn’t they have just gone and washed hands ? It says living organisms and germs are one
4,"Oct 23, 2020",Anyone Getting Belko experiment Vibes from this?
4,"Oct 23, 2020",he doing nothing wtf
4,"Oct 22, 2020",but they don't have to kill each other... they could just go outside and rip shreds of grass and that would count.
4,"Oct 21, 2020",i'm getting goosebumps. 
4,"Oct 21, 2020",if I was in this situation I would find something real quick and Merkel somebody's head of
4,"Oct 20, 2020",ya know you can kill the cockroaches they are living organisms 
4,"Oct 20, 2020",pick me up mom. pick me up.    pick me up mom 
4,"Oct 20, 2020",Can someone educate me? This started as a book or a web comic somewhere else?
4,"Oct 20, 2020",mom pick me up i'm scared
4,"Oct 19, 2020",Monokuma be like:
4,"Oct 18, 2020",wow i am reading this because I wanted to get the badges or whatever it is but actually I think I might read it again after the challenge 😸
4,"Oct 17, 2020",".....my heart just doesnt feel well and I don't feel well like if I was standing I'd need to lean on something to hold myself up. I'm just shocked at what happened and woohoo I was right. The biggest fear is of what humans are capable of to gain what they desire, which in this case is to survive. For example LOOK AT HOW FAST SOMEONE WAS WAS SHOT IN THE OTHER CABIN. Also when Dokja was wondering why Hyeonseong Lee, one of the major supporting characters, has appeared and not someone else."
4,"Oct 17, 2020",I am so scared wth I got me and my friends to start reading it because I thought the main character was cute I am NOT PREPARED
4,"Oct 17, 2020",This should be an anime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Oct 17, 2020",That Lieutenant is a snacc. 🤭
4,"Oct 16, 2020",I bet the guy Dokja is waiting for will turn out to be Dokja himself
4,"Oct 16, 2020",I'm scaredbut I want to read on. 😂😂😭😭😭
4,"Oct 16, 2020",Dude your mail said MAIN character. 
4,"Oct 16, 2020",This is good keep up the good work
4,"Oct 15, 2020",This feels a bit like DICE but everyone's comments sound really promising that the story won't drop in quality.
4,"Oct 15, 2020",He's WAAAY more insane than Monokuma
4,"Oct 15, 2020","Dang man🤣🤣, I keep seeing people post about killing other living things but don't forget guys they are in a train cabin there's not guarantee you'd find a cockroach, an ant, a fly (and that wouldn't mean you'd be able to catch without a fly squatter) or anything else of that nature. And we should also assume that they Dokkaebi has basically teleported or killed anything else in the vicinity to force people to kill each other."
4,"Oct 15, 2020",HIM is probably Dokja or what is his name? I'll go check some previous episodes...
4,"Oct 15, 2020",think people he said kill a living thing it doesn't have to be a person
4,"Oct 15, 2020",Goblin boy never bothered looking up the definition of terrorism.
4,"Oct 15, 2020","the murder has my mom's name, lmao"
4,"Oct 15, 2020",This somewhat reminds me of the hunger games haha 
4,"Oct 15, 2020",This is like if Battle Royale was placed in an intense fantasy world. I am here for it!
4,"Oct 15, 2020", huaaa i feel like in other world 
4,"Oct 15, 2020",BOII YOU'RE THE MC HAHAGA;!

4,"Oct 14, 2020",dam she a bad girl
4,"Oct 14, 2020",that dokkaebi is annoying
4,"Oct 13, 2020",I wonder if using hand sanitizer counts as killing a living organism
4,"Oct 9, 2020","Couldn’t you technically kill a bug? I mean, it IS a living organism xD "
4,"Oct 8, 2020",OK BUT actually HE'S THE HERO LMAO SOMEBODY TELL HIM

4,"Oct 2, 2020",Does Jihye Lee play a role in this story? Like beeing a bad ass love intrest or enemy or something? Just curious ^^ 
4,"Sep 30, 2020",Getting major danganrompa vibes
4,"Sep 30, 2020","I'm honestly so glad I get to read this, it's so interesting omg"
4,"Sep 29, 2020",This is deliriously evil😃
4,"Sep 28, 2020","Im just happy they used 'Hyeonseong' rather than 'Hyunsung'. There was a bit of a drama in  one certain novel site where a change in translators happened near 400th chapter and everyone was mad that they were served with 'Hyeonseong' because they were used to 'Hyunsung'. They were so blinded by the change that they didn't notice how bad the old TL was, they didn't even proofread their work and mistranslated a bunch of stuff which was important because ORV is heavy with Korean history and myths."
4,"Sep 28, 2020",can i just say that the girl at the all girls high school is hot
4,"Sep 27, 2020","it says kill one or more living ORGANISMS that means cells too, because they are alive and organisms, so just get sick basically... in 30 minutes"
4,"Sep 23, 2020",I'm definitely liking this so far
4,"Sep 17, 2020",this kinda like a Darwins game 🤔
4,"Sep 15, 2020","So then, realistically, he knows when each character will die, as well. Although it seems events can be slightly tweaked..."
4,"Sep 13, 2020",is this translated to English? I want to read the novel
4,"Sep 12, 2020","Alright everyone calm down, yeah right only the strongest live "
4,"Sep 8, 2020","the real question is the web novel in this webtoon [sonds weird but u get it right? the web novel that came to life]  is actually really good.it should get a lot of views, how the f is it so underrated"
4,"Sep 4, 2020",just fricking kill an ant 😖😖😖
4,"Sep 4, 2020",“any living organism” couldn’t you just kill a bug and survive?
4,"Sep 4, 2020",Okay but Lieutenant Hyeongseong Lee do be looking mighty fine 😗👌
4,"Sep 2, 2020",The art is so good 😍
4,"Sep 2, 2020","oh! if you look back in the prolouge Dokja is a badass and he's fighting ""him"""
4,"Sep 2, 2020",The characters look so cool.
4,"Aug 30, 2020","Bruh this dude has been playing the ""Deja Vu I have be in the place before!"" for forever now. He said earlier that he wouldnt let bad stuff go down and yet he has done nothing this entire time."
4,"Aug 29, 2020",I think he's the main character? Probably? 
4,"Aug 29, 2020",I'm getting some Dangaronpa vibes from this shit
4,"Aug 29, 2020",bruh
4,"Aug 29, 2020",something doesn't feel right about the soldier.
4,"Aug 29, 2020",why does he remind me of Monokuma
4,"Aug 29, 2020","Wow my respects to the author for such great illustrations, this seems like an anime! 🤩🤩🤩🤩 This is amaizing! "
4,"Aug 29, 2020","That panel with the full face frontal of the creature really sent chills down my spine. Wonderful art and story, it really took a hold of me. Especially that scene with the high school girls, I felt like I was in that moment hesitating to kill one of my classmates. The concept itself is so bizarre but you need to adapt to new situations when it comes to your survival and the survival of the group by sacrificing one. It's tough and I seriously gasped when the time limit was decreased too!"
4,"Aug 29, 2020","nobody:
my brain: twasa"
4,"Aug 29, 2020",Love the art!!

4,"Aug 27, 2020","honestly if i were in an apocaypse i probably wouldn't bother to try and live, im not the main character"

4,"Aug 26, 2020",why do they repost here and make people pay for it ??
4,"Aug 26, 2020",I just wanted to ask if the violent scenes get more explicit later because I'm a sensitive person but this webtoon has caught my attention :( 
4,"Aug 26, 2020","A friend of mine introduced me to DiCE, which has the ""do quest for reward"" idea, but it kinda grew stale after a while. This series seems interesting, with the stakes being high right off the bat, and I think I'll spend my Free 5 Coins I got from the ""Quest"". I read the Boxer series for the quest, and it while it was interesting, I've always liked Fantasy stuff more."
4,"Aug 26, 2020",the little fingers so cute but so deadly 
4,"Aug 26, 2020","Came here for the coins, now I'm here for the story. This is actually awesome! But that lil creature looked so cute at first, who would have thought it would be a 2-faced murder who blows people's heads up 💥"

4,"Aug 22, 2020",2) the exact same
4,"Aug 22, 2020","1) So that’s why the guy asks him “who the hell are you” because Dokja isn’t supposed to be the main character but the other guy with the long black coat, THAT’S why things aren’t going exactly as the comic originally showed it because Dokja is a variable/character that wasn’t taken into account before and he has a huge influence in the story because he’s supposed to be a main character not just a mere side character. The comic he read will give clues as to what will happen next but it won’t be "

4,"Aug 21, 2020",finally this is on here!!!
4,"Aug 21, 2020","Okay I’m calling it, instead of killing a human being he’s gonna kill the bugs that the little boy had. It only specifies that u need to kill a living organism, it doesn’t have to be human. "

4,"Aug 20, 2020",👁👄👁 well that's another novel to add to the list of what I'm reading next 
4,"Aug 20, 2020","i haven't read the novel or the manhwa or anything, maybe they're gonna kill the kid's bugs? The weird horned thingy didn't specify killing humans right. I guess."

4,"Aug 20, 2020",I look forward to this WEBTOON
4,"Aug 20, 2020","I mean they were focusing in on the cicadas, which must mean their important, and the kill a living organism doesn't specify that you have to kill a human. I also have one critique that they should try making the cicada thing if it's true a little more suttle."
4,"Aug 20, 2020","I'm a first time reader, so please don't get mad if I'm right but, my guess is that the main character kills one of the cicadas the little boy had or was that a part of a past memory?"

4,"Aug 20, 2020",That's when anti-bacterial comes in handy. Bacteria are living organisms too. 
4,"Aug 20, 2020","Ngl, it took him 10 years, it would probably take us only like a week😂"

4,"Aug 19, 2020",How does Dokja recall what he read in the span of 10 years ago?
4,"Aug 19, 2020","I don’t like how people who have read the scanlations before webtoon’s have to wait months in order for webtoon to catch up with the other scanlations, why not just use another teams GOOD scan and then scan late your own"
4,"Aug 19, 2020",I was contemplating leaving webtoons behind for a while but I think that can wait for 10 years because I got this now.
4,"Aug 19, 2020","even though you are on chapter 17, i bet you are still reading this"

4,"Jul 1, 2022","Maybe he didn't appear yet (whoever you're pertaining to) because you're now a protagonist of the story, Dokja. And also, that's why the story changed? Just guessing. "

4,"Mar 12, 2022",Is this really reminding me of danganronpa but the start the killing immediately. The creature looking thing is monokuma. Please tell me am I right or wrong. If you haven't seen danganronpa you should see it. It is good and that there are 4 versions of it and games and manga and a show for version 1 and you can find it on hulu. But those who do know danganronpa you would already know what I am talking about.

4,"Aug 19, 2021",Actually it was very simple to solve. There’s a child in the cabin with a box of bugs. They should have thought about it since bugs are literally living organisms. It’s really like a puzzle game. People see the matter on the wrong side. 
4,"Aug 19, 2021",intense.
4,"Aug 12, 2021","out of context but if i were there, you know as hell i would have already killed some mosquito to live"
4,"Aug 8, 2021",yall remember the kid with the cockroaches right? well the assignment is to kill a living organism (doesn't have to be a human) so why won't the guy kill a cockroach lol.

4,"Jul 25, 2021",id kill one of those asking what's going on still. they clearly ain't gonna last long if they cant fallow a simple explanation. also i feel this particular scenario wouldn't be so bad if people thought logically instead of emotionally. we got any old or sick around? sorry not sorry. only lines I wouldn't cross when killing is a child. they havnt even been given a proper chance yet. (theoretically  of corse lol)

4,"Aug 29, 2020",Why are they hesitating survival rate is zero if they do nothing 
4,"Aug 29, 2020",A very good webtoon novel

4,"Aug 26, 2020",Is this survival mode?
4,"Aug 26, 2020",see this is the perfect example of why solo leveling and the beginning after the end should've went to webtoon! the web novel was insane and bringing it to webtoon brought the all the people to it and gave it the love it deserves.

"
4,"Aug 25, 2020",Amazing. Battle royal time
4,"Aug 25, 2020","this is like those Japanese movies, where you have to play for your life like as the God's will etc."
4,"Aug 25, 2020",Its like a hunger game version 
4,"Aug 25, 2020",Will plot do something in the next 2 episodes?

4,"Aug 24, 2020","I felt it in my heart that that little rabied infected fake a furby meant they needed to murder people in the train car in order to survive. I was hoping it would be like little summon monsters, but I knew...yep I knew. Survival of the fullest, it's a test to see who is most fit to survive and navigate this horrific new terrain. Let's be honest in the apocalypse its not the creatures you need to fear, it's other human beings. "
4,"Aug 24, 2020",OMG LET'S GO
4,"Aug 24, 2020",I'm afraid for the end of this story now.

4,"Aug 24, 2020","The novel is already completed for anyone that wants to read the novel. You can just search the title ""Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint"" and all the novel sites that have it will show. But still, pls support this on the Webnovel app it is also there. That is what i do.

4,"Aug 23, 2020",...
4,"Aug 23, 2020",It seems legit but one question; is it really a prize; I mean he could die at any time but it’s phrased as a “gift”?
4,"Aug 23, 2020",this story is so smart and gooood 
4,"Aug 23, 2020",need more!! :))
4,"Aug 23, 2020",I can’t be the only one who would also kill it I needed to right ?
4,"Aug 23, 2020",is this an actual book? I wouldn't mind buying it if it meant I could read ahead.
4,"Aug 23, 2020","Me, a smartass: Just squish the blood on the floor, cells are living organisms."

4,"Aug 23, 2020",For a sec it was kinda cute... but then stuff happened.

4,"Aug 23, 2020",I am intrigued 
4,"Aug 23, 2020",I know who the main topic in the next episode and how he solves the problem but he still hasn't realized it .
4,"Aug 23, 2020",I wonder if anyone will figure out the loophole to the rules (the line about organisms)
4,"Aug 23, 2020",ooh i like that girl. i like her better than the other popular girl from work
4,"Aug 22, 2020",man I love the length of these chapters

4,"Aug 22, 2020",it's good to see this into webtoon ... but the translation kind of different and not to detail like other website that publish this series ... but love to have this series coz will update regularly once a week 😁
4,"Aug 22, 2020",I have a feeling that the evil entity is somehow related bye blood family or smt with the dude
4,"Aug 22, 2020",Anybody know where I can read solo leveling? 
4,"Aug 22, 2020",Kinda reminds me of Danganronpa. Maybe goblin thing and Monokuma are cousins :7
4,"Aug 22, 2020",AHHHHHHHH I'M SCREAMING MY EYES THE SUSPENSE AHHHH
4,"Aug 22, 2020",Dang. It became a Webtoon. Doesn't this mean like Your Throne/If Only I Could Be You For A Day it'll stop being translated elsewhere? Because that would be one hell of a wait for new chapters.

4,"Aug 21, 2020",yo no spoilers pls
4,"Aug 21, 2020",looks very similar to Reincarnator ranobe imo. like it very much.
4,"Aug 21, 2020","For everyone who doesn’t know this is currently out and translated with 18 chapters, my guess is they just recently partnered with webtoon."
4,"Aug 21, 2020",15 more weeks for chapter 18
4,"Aug 20, 2020",why can't this upload faster :(
4,"Aug 20, 2020",Also excuse if I'm wrong but I feel like I'm reading 2 of my favorite anime Assassination Classroom and SAO together. I don't know why... but the series is hella good and the plot is the literally to die for even in the start of the series. I'm living in heaven but them not so much.
4,"Aug 20, 2020","I love how everyone here is like soo happy that one of their favorite webnovels has come to webtoons....meanwhile im here shaking and feeling the emotions and having sinking heart feelings , being in the situation..its nuts "
4,"Aug 20, 2020",something to look forward to every week! 🥺
4,"Aug 20, 2020",Who read the novel already this should sound familiar 'Monarch of the Small Fries' ;)
4,"Aug 20, 2020",HEHEHEHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHSHEHSHHEhhaahehheheehehHEHWHHAHHEHEWHAHEHHEEHEHEHHE
4,"Aug 20, 2020",It's good 
4,"Aug 20, 2020",I'm pretty sure the 'he' Dokja mentioned is the main caracter and is also Dokja himself
4,"Aug 20, 2020",I'd find that kid who had grasshoppers with him and probably ki!! one of those since they're living organisms??? I'm really looking forward for next episodes!!
4,"Aug 20, 2020",I’m assuming Dokja is like the “main protagonist” from the story he was reading 
4,"Aug 20, 2020",Reminds me of as god the goods will
4,"Aug 20, 2020",this is giving me some danganronpa vibes
4,"Aug 20, 2020",I didn't know this was a webtoon 😂
4,"Aug 20, 2020",U bet ur ass

4,"Aug 20, 2020",This story has Battle Royale vibes
4,"Aug 20, 2020",Dokkaebi reminds me of Kyubey from madoka Magica. Cute but sadistically evil. This the whole thing going to be battle royale where people have to kill others to survive?
4,"Aug 20, 2020","well if i was him, i was going to do exactly they did in the novel. thats the only way i could predict whats gonna happen."

4,"Aug 20, 2020","I like this build up, feels like its gonna be an awesome one"

4,"Aug 19, 2020","The cockroaches. There was a kid with a box with some insects last chapter or the one before. They count as living organisms. There are not enough for the whole cabin, but it does fill the condition right? "
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Chap 18 now
4,"Aug 19, 2020",I'm so happy that it's finally here. I had already read the scanlations a few days ago but I'm still signing up here to support the artist!!
4,"Aug 19, 2020",i hope the old people and most especially the praying granny and the youngsters are fine😭
4,"Aug 19, 2020","For everyone wondering where to read more chapters, i find mine on mangakakalot"
4,"Aug 19, 2020",i like  this bc i can watch it during online class 
4,"Aug 19, 2020",the art stlye just put all the arts i've drawn into shame and the story so far is better than any scenario's i do in my head ... so good
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Now that we have omniscient reader we only miss overgeared and then we'll have the best LN  adaptation on webtoon.
4,"Aug 19, 2020",READ IT ON MANGAGO.ME ITS ALREADY ON CHAPTER 18
4,"Aug 19, 2020",",am i really hope this is 3000+"

4,"Aug 19, 2020",now i found another novel to read ty :D
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Has anyone noticed in the Prologue or chapter 1 that when dijka (what’s his name) was battling a different guy with swords?? That guy REALLY looked like the protagonist of Solo Levelling... IM SO CONFUSED EEEEE
4,"Aug 19, 2020",other source chapter 18 is out
4,"Aug 19, 2020",ho ho ho just found another gem to binge 😃 .... like this is so good my mouth is watering 🤭..
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Me if I was in the situation and actually able to commit murder:ANYONE GOT A KNIFE I COULD BORROW????? ILL SPARE YA!!
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Sounds like we need to come through with a 200 IQ play 
4,"Aug 19, 2020","sanga... hyeonseong.... lmao at this point i think scanlation did a better job at translatin this. Because they use the honorific ""-ssi"" to show that Dokja and Sanga is using formal language and respecting each other because they're not that close to the point they remove the honorific to address each other.But at least im happy that we got an official translations."
4,"Aug 19, 2020","Wow! These past few chapters have been an entertaining read, will definitely be keeping my eye on this one."
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Kinda like battle royale. Too bad i thought they could insects or plants(if those count) 
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Okay but like... Just kill insects or something that might be in the subway. it's not like the subway suddenly is super hygenic or something. 
4,"Aug 19, 2020",so far so good 👍 👌 
4,"Aug 19, 2020",i need nore this too good
4,"Aug 19, 2020","wow that's terrible! maybe the ""he"" is our dokja? "
4,"Aug 19, 2020",omg its so good
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Ahhhh this so gwwwwd!!! >w<
4,"Aug 19, 2020","me after finish all 5 episodes of this series: ""Oh wow interesting..."""
4,"Aug 19, 2020",All those heads exploding like that really reminds me of the belko experiment 
4,"Aug 19, 2020",on webtoon xyz theres alrdy 15 ep of this
4,"Aug 19, 2020",but could it be. that they also could kill a bug to survive? edit: DaWra sucks
4,"Aug 19, 2020","Idrk if the character designer is the same of Solo Leveling, but Jesus Christ this WebToon's designs actually compete with that Manhwa's😳"
4,"Aug 19, 2020","Sleepy-C, Dokja is the 'He', that he has been talking about!!🙆‍♀️🤧😲Thank you!"
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Is this the same author as solo leveling?
4,"Aug 19, 2020",who else going to the novel since they can't wait?
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Omg this look good. can we read the novel for free or we need to buy? 
4,"Aug 19, 2020","sign me up baby, the table are about to turn!!"
4,"Aug 19, 2020","Wait... Any living organism! What about bugs? There  is always something, like fly, right?"
4,"Aug 19, 2020",It starts so good so i can't wait to see next chapters
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Now this is intense! I love it! 🙂
4,"Aug 19, 2020","This story is getting interesting, I might stay around and watch"
4,"Aug 19, 2020",AHHHHHHHHHHH I CANT WAIT TO MEET SOOYOUNG🤧
4,"Aug 19, 2020",I wonder if that army character was introduced early so that ppl can kill him off. If he’s a big supporting character in TWSA then maybe he’s a threat to the apocalypse & they want to eliminate him. I think whoever wrote TWSA did it to warn ppl of what was coming so they could prepare and mess up the planned events of the apocalypse 
4,"Aug 19, 2020",this is soooo hellaaaa coool.....!!!! 
4,"Aug 19, 2020",this plot is genius
4,"Aug 19, 2020",sooooo i have never been hooked so fast to a manhwa i fell as if this is going to be one top 10 best on webtoon
4,"Aug 19, 2020",hype
4,"Aug 19, 2020",I absolutely love this art
4,"Aug 19, 2020","have same art as solo leveling and its amazing 👌 and instead of game like ability, he follows the story of a novel 😍 Im glad that this manhwa is in webtoon now and maybe the author gains new supporters because of this 😍"
4,"Aug 19, 2020","I see, so this is like ""your trone"". It was already online! But i must say this is way more interesting."
4,"Aug 19, 2020",BRO THEY FINALLY FREAKING POSTED THIS ON WEBTOON HELL YEAH BUT WHY ARE THEY POSTING SO SLOW ON WEBTOON BRO 💀💀
4,"Aug 19, 2020",cool art and fun action
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Couldn't you just crush some insects or lick some bacteria from your hand and kill them by digestion or something?
4,"Aug 19, 2020",It's so exciting to see the characters from the novel show up!!!!!
4,"Aug 19, 2020",Still can't get over the amazing art *_*

4,"Sep 24, 2022","Why is this MC acting like a retard. He first says he doesn't remember how things went and then says why hasn't someone showed up. You either do remember or you don't especially if you know which character is supposed to show up (very specific detail). Also, if the story started like that you sure as hell would remember what you had to do to end it instead of waiting there like an idiot. it said living organism so it can be anything living but most will go for someone instead."

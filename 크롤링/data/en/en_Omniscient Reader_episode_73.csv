Episode,Date,Review
73,"Oct 6, 2021",She fell for the oldest trick in the Dokja book
73,"Oct 6, 2021",Dokja is just a troll [+5 coins]
73,"Oct 6, 2021","Gotta say, it just feels wholesome seeing him unleash an ass-kicking of a lifetime with such a happy smile."
73,"Oct 6, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" have come up in a conclusion that not all trash are worth disposing.] [5 coins have been sponsored. ]"
73,"Oct 6, 2021","Oh man, I'm so excited for future emotional arcs! This must've been cathartic for Dokja. His exasperated & endeared smile while he was laughing about Joonghyuk. He was like, ""Damn, my hero growing up has some murderous tendencies, huh?"" That was probably his most genuine smile/laugh in a long time ü•∫ That imagery of younger Dokja ""watching"" from the back, then disappearing afterwards w/ a lil smile üò≠ "
73,"Oct 7, 2021","If you‚Äôre wondering why the Monkey King is laughing when Dokja ask why ‚Äúself-justification‚Äù is any good
In the korean version ‚Äúself-justification‚Äù is written in chinese charater and Dokja ask what so special about it to deserve to be written in chinese characters"
73,"Oct 6, 2021",Nice to know he still can con people to do stupid things üòÇ
73,"Oct 6, 2021","any other situation where someone smiles while beating the living shit out of someone would be considered psycho worthy, but.. this just feels good."
73,"Oct 6, 2021","Dokja overcoming his trauma and understanding how much he's grown just means a lot, character development is 10/10."
73,"Oct 6, 2021","People should learn already that if Dokja doesn't want it, nobody should want it"
73,"Oct 6, 2021","Kim Dokja:""What would Yu Junghyeok do?Meanwhile Yu Jung-Hyeok to other characters: You BETRAY ME, NOW YOU WILL DIE.
Kim Dokja:üôÇ *Sigh*"
73,"Oct 6, 2021","I wonder who the next victim of the ""sure go ahead"" is"
73,"Oct 6, 2021",Art is pretty and dokja getting prettier 
73,"Oct 6, 2021",The cheekiest shrug ever by Dokja at the end üòÇ
73,"Oct 6, 2021","Honestly This is by far my favorite chapter of a WEBTOON. Seeing dokja being confronted by his trauma and dealing with it really resonated with me even whenhe clearly had the upper hand with the TWSA knowage and coin buffs he still was shaking up by his bully , I could be reading to much into it but it made he seem so relatable and the fact that he won and the wholesome stigma he got after it was Icing on the cake. EXCELLENT chapter for me"
73,"Oct 6, 2021","I love him, look at him misleading people by shrugging, making everyone mad, a legend "
73,"Oct 7, 2021",Dokja: My childhood role model is a murderous bastard... that explains a few thing about my own personality.
73,"Oct 6, 2021","I honestly feel kinda bad for Dokja. Yes we all have our trauma, but having to face it head on during the apocalypse when your old world is essentially erased? And the potential to die if you don't?"
73,"Oct 6, 2021","Dokja looks so.. *sigh* he's quite well built but so lean at the same time, and huggable, and cunning, and - - - "
73,"Oct 6, 2021",Lmao this reminds me when that demon baby momma Myeongon Han took the final kill of dokjas ‚Äúwarden of the dark‚Äù in episode 22 üòÇ and the demon king ‚Äúgod of wrath and love‚Äù focused on him as well‚Ä¶. Smh someone should teach them about taking other peoples kills
73,"Oct 6, 2021","Maybe should have realized by now, if Dokja thinks it's a bad idea, it's probably a bad idea xD"
73,"Oct 13, 2021",this show again how much Junghyeok was a confort character for him and how TWTSA help him when things were hard for him. omg I love Dokja
73,"Oct 7, 2021","Oh shit, Suyeong's got a Discord moderator out looking for her, she better watch her back."
73,"Oct 6, 2021",alright who said he was ugly? I need to have a word with you 
73,"Oct 6, 2021",passive skill activated! [oh sh*t here we go again] you have subconsciously spent 5 coins.
73,"Oct 6, 2021",Can we take a moment and appreciate how happy Dokja was in this chapter? Like wow good for him
73,"Oct 6, 2021","Did she really not use her ""Lie detection"" skill there and then? Plagiarist! Come on! Such a clich√© move...."
73,"Nov 10, 2021",I mean‚Ä¶ he did warn her‚Ä¶
73,"Nov 10, 2021",I love it when Dokja smiles üòÇ 
73,"Oct 6, 2021","I gave up waiting for updates because I'm impatient and have been reading the novel, and honestly... I don't read often, but I strongly recommend it to anyone who sees this comment!!!"
73,"Nov 4, 2021",Something about him laughing genuinely after thinking about what Yoo Jonghyuk would do makes me feel all soft and mushy for some reason. 
73,"Oct 16, 2021",ah I can't get enough of Kim Dokja smile (‚ï•Ôπè‚ï•) his genuine smile and laugh was so precious
73,"Nov 10, 2021","If I had a nickel for every time Dokja let his teammates steal his kills and become enemies with thousand year old demons. I'd have two nickels, it isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice."
73,"Nov 10, 2021","That moment when he started shaking again, mid blows after he had an eye contact with minu adds so much more to the story. Its not just pow pow die, I'm so much more stronger now. But it shows how deep rooted his trauma is and no amount of progress he has made in that ""game"" could easily remove something like that. Something that haunted his youth. To anyone getting bullied, I hope you know that you're good, that you're going to be OK. It's only words ig, but I genuinely wish you well. Hugs. "
73,"Oct 6, 2021","Dokja's unhinged smile is giving me LIFE. Him thinking about Joonghyuk and thinking, ""It's okay to be a psycho, actually"" & beating the shit out of this guy was peak "
73,"Nov 10, 2021","That‚Äôs true tho, bullies can genuinely say ‚Äúwe were just kids, I didn‚Äôt know better, it‚Äôs all in the past yeah?‚Äù and they can move on, but the victim stays having scars and nightmares that can impact their self esteem and mental wellbeing for years. Being a kid doesn‚Äôt equal or excuse being a dumbass, if that were the case, all the kids in Dokja‚Äôs school including Dokja himself would‚Äôve been bullies"
73,"Nov 11, 2021","When he said ""I'm not the one you should be apologizing for,"" that's so powerful. He realizes his past was the one who hurt and his present self understand the reason better, but still that sad memory linger. It's true for whatever trauma we've experienced (bullying, social problem, near death, abuse) there's this feeling that make us tremble everytime we're faced/confronted by the similar or same cond. It's trully frightening. But once we overcome & deal with it we come up stronger than before."
73,"Oct 6, 2021","KIM DOKJA‚ÄôS SMILE THAT ISN‚ÄôT HIM BEING SINISTER IS KILLING ME, BREATHING ME BACK TO LIFE, MURDERING ME AGAIN, AND TRANSCENDING ME TO HEAVEN. "
73,"Nov 10, 2021","jung heewon: if it weren't for the laws of this land, i would've killed 
you //
yoo jonghyuk: i do not care for the 
laws of this land, i will kill you"
73,"Nov 10, 2021","""what would he have done?"" *murder murder murder* ""understandable, have a nice day"""
73,"Nov 10, 2021",Someone: *breaths* //Jonghyuk: So you have chosen death.
73,"Nov 10, 2021",happy dokja is best dokja
73,"Nov 10, 2021","I really like how Junghyeok deals with his problems: ""You betrayed me. Die"", "" You ate my cupcake, now die"", ""you shat on my toilet. Die"", ""You changed the channel while I was watching, die"", "" You moved my chair. DIE"""
73,"Nov 10, 2021",THE PANEL W YOUNGER KDJ STANDING BEHIND CURRENT KDJ WHILE HE SAYS HE ISNT THE ONE HE SHLD BE APOLOGISING TO üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
73,"Nov 11, 2021","the scene where the 17 year-old dokja appeared and the current dokja looked at him just hit me right in the feels, man üò≠ and dokja probably don't know this but he's scarier than junghyeok. like dude, he beats the light out of people while smiling. i love him sm wtf"
73,"Nov 17, 2021","When he said ""I'm not the one you should be apologizing for,"" that's so powerful.

73,"Nov 10, 2021","i saw a twitter thread that the fourth wall skill hides dokja's facial features a bit lmao i really refuse to believe that characters think dokja looks plain because ive fallen in love with him for the 80th time this chapter, he was definitely nerfed by the skill"
73,"Nov 10, 2021","Dokja: ""Even though I've finally confronted my trauma, I still haven't and might never fully overcome it-""Constellation: ""here's an 'immune-to-trauma' ability lol"""
73,"Nov 10, 2021",‚ÄúI still read fantasy novels.‚Äù kind of a badass one liner that can only make sense in this context
73,"Nov 10, 2021","YJH: ""Hey, I know you were the guy that put my fries in the fridge. You gotta die, man. And YOU! Don't act like I didn't see you stealing 1 of my socks earlier, you monster, üó°Ô∏è. Oh, and you? You didn't really do anything, but you can die, too, I guess."""
73,"Oct 6, 2021",Why did he say that stigma was a joke? He is impervious to trauma? It may not give him any more super powers but it plays perfectly with everything else and bruh I would probably kill to be impervious to my trauma‚Ä¶
73,"Nov 10, 2021",I bet the secretive plotter is giggling
73,"Nov 10, 2021",his facial expressions this chapter are top tier
73,"Nov 10, 2021",his shiny little smile right before he punches him across the stratosphere üíÄ

73,"Nov 10, 2021",he really did the same thing twice XD
73,"Nov 10, 2021","It's so nice to see Dokja laugh, especially when he remembered Joonghyuk just killing everyone lol"
73,"Nov 10, 2021",ahhhh his smile looks so tired already and this is only the beginning. Our poor Kim Dokjaüò≠üò≠
73,"Oct 6, 2021","I miss huiwon and the others, I hope they‚Äôre reunited soon"
73,"Nov 10, 2021",is... is that the constellations idea of therapy?
73,"Nov 10, 2021","Dojka, I can‚Äôt decide if that was an evil move there since Suyeong is an ally, but I bet all my coins that The Secretive Plotter must‚Äôve loved that! EDIT: I just remembered all the shit Suyeong has done and caused earlier in the story, so I‚Äôd say this was fair"
73,"Nov 10, 2021",what‚Äôs wrong with reading fantasy novels you bitchüò§
73,"Nov 10, 2021","""Guess I've got some more growing up to do. I still read fantasy novels :D"" I feel called out"
73,"Nov 11, 2021",I saw no light in dokja‚Äôs eyes and for a moment I was scared‚Ä¶ but damn that felt good.
73,"Nov 10, 2021",I'm glad his backstory came into the picture. He's not just a nebulous reader now; we can actually begin to understand him. 
73,"Nov 10, 2021","I have a question for Dokja's childhood bully, what's so wrong with reading novels? I love anime, and manga, and especially manhwa so what's wrong with enjoying something you love and letting the fact show"
73,"Nov 17, 2021",I mean he did warn you 
73,"Nov 12, 2021","i hope the writers of this comic see this comment bc it truly makes me so happy as a trauma and bullying victim who's now an adult to read how Dokja's character arc was executed here, i was worried it would end poorly and make Dokja ""be the bigger person"" but watching him play out his power fantasy of beating up Minu rly hit home for me, and the nuance put into this portrayal of healing from trauma was very realistic for a video game scenario, well done!!"
73,"Nov 11, 2021",let's just appreciate dokja kim smile when said that he still reads fantasy novels cuz that's some smile to watch
73,"Nov 10, 2021",His character is developing step by step. üëèüëè
73,"Nov 10, 2021",I‚Äôm sure everyone of us here would have smile on our face when beat the shit out of the bully who caused us trauma

73,"Dec 21, 2021",This episode totally remind me of my traumatic experince with my bully. Also how I confronted him and shut him out in front of everyone after years of facing my trauma. I am truly proud of Me and DOKJAüíì. Thank you so much for such an emotional and well done episodeüò©.
73,"Nov 15, 2021","it always that smile with a beautiful background when the main character going to beat their enemy, like that one scene of gojo ""hahahaah i'll murder you"""
73,"Nov 14, 2021","uh I've just found it kinda symbolic at how it was her who killed kdj's bully (even though she is also kinda 'tricked' in this), the art also  captures their subtle emotions in that scene. the parallels and foreshadows in this story is as juicy as ever"
73,"Nov 12, 2021","Is ""The One who overcame the trials a little too late"" Herakles? I dunno, it just feels like it..."

73,"Nov 11, 2021",they really look like siblings
73,"Nov 11, 2021",Loved this chapter seeing Dokja facing his past was so relatable! The art and the story is so dope üî•

73,"Nov 10, 2021",I just love that by now he has practically hijacked this story and has become the main character

73,"Oct 6, 2021","When someone says, ""Sure, go ahead..."", you never just sure go ahead. Has she never seen any movies ever?"
73,"Nov 10, 2021",I just realized with this chapter that Suyeong Han has had such pronounced canines the last few chapters and it makes me wonder if she is still fully human.
73,"Nov 13, 2021","""What would Yoo Jonghyuk do?"" is probably the most dangerous question to ask, because often it ends up with someone getting k√≠lled "
73,"Nov 12, 2021",man. i love dokja so much üò≠ just finished binge reading this whole webtoon and mannnn i‚Äôm hooked üò≠
73,"Nov 11, 2021",Welp... He DID warn her tho~~ SMH

73,"Nov 10, 2021","Thinking about early in the series, when dokja was fighting those ghosts, it was implied that he had some more significant trauma with something around his mom I think‚Ä¶ I wonder if that‚Äôs how his new new stigma is going to have an effect"
73,"Nov 10, 2021",That is The second person to get on an evil gods watch list in this series. I Wonder how the first one we saw is doing right now? 
73,"Nov 10, 2021",Now that Dokja mentioned them... I miss Bihyeong. He was such a good dokkaebi(Sorry I am not good with spellings). Atleast better than the current one üôÑ

73,"Nov 10, 2021","okokokokok no hate to whoevers shiping sooyoung and dokja! i like that ship a lot too as a novel reader but i wanna talk about joongdok in this comment. the laugh and small smile he made after thinking of yjh really showed his love for yjh (imo). and in the novel, his smiles were often described as fake laughs iirc so tbh his small smile to himself seemed more genuine to me compared to when he smiled/laughed at hsy. ofc this is just my take though and although i do love joongdok more, i quite +"

73,"Dec 16, 2021","I've personally been bullied so this triggered my trauma , I'm so happy for Dokja that he overcome his own trauma and took revenge wish I can beat my bullies as well. I'm also so glad to see the author raising awareness over bullying and desmontrating how much it can affect someone, if you are a victim of bullying pls take care of yourself, let's do our best to live a good life. And if you know someone who was bullied pls be there for them and don't leave them alone. "
73,"Nov 29, 2021","This ""Dokja Overcoming His Trauma"" chapter is so wholesome."
73,"Nov 26, 2021",I‚Äôm absolutely in love with DokjaüòÇ
73,"Nov 15, 2021","man, this episode hits hard. as someone who has been bullied watching Dokja overcome his trauma really hits home. what people don't really understand is that when someone is bullied it doesn't go away it stays with you, so while you might feel fine but seeing the people who bullied you can bring back those bad memories."

73,"Nov 10, 2021",I have to admit I wouldn't mind giving some old bully some good beating myself. I get what he meant but it must have felt pretty good to give him a little  pay back.

73,"Nov 13, 2021","overcoming your trauma to get a stigma that makes you immune to trauma is like acing a math test and getting a scientific calculator

73,"Dec 16, 2021",this chapter is just gold! made me tear up a little. I really love how they handle the topic of trauma and bullying. It really is not as simple as just killing the bully or becoming stronger and better than him. When it's true the bully just doesn't know better the damage they do will last for a life time for the people reviving it. At the end there is no one to revenge for the trauma that is your life. Love to see Dokja grow past it and laughing at how rediculous everything is.
73,"Dec 15, 2021","Dokja's like Satoru Gojo ""I'll murder youüòä""... you know, that part? "

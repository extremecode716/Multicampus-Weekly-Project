Episode,Date,Review
84,"Dec 22, 2021",Woah he understood he needed support so he came in clutch like a true bestie😭🖤The way they just know each other and support each other even if they aren't necessarily friends is so awesome
84,"Dec 22, 2021",yes! the ultimate team up!! FINALLY!!!
84,"Dec 22, 2021",Welcome Back Everyone!!!!! Happy Holidays & Merry Christmas to those who celebrate it!!! 😊🎄 What and Gift to see this power couple finally team up 🎁😆
84,"Dec 22, 2021",MC keeps forgetting he isn't the real MC
84,"Dec 22, 2021",Dokja forgetting his skill is like me forgetting I have a calculator halfway through a math test.
84,"Dec 22, 2021",whoa that last pannel of Junghyeok standing over the disaster would do great for a wallpaper. Too bad we can't take screenshots TT edit: ya'll guess who got the coolest wallpaper 
84,"Dec 22, 2021",[Head] [Head] [Head] [Head] [Head] *Thwackkk*
84,"Dec 23, 2021","Dokja: I need more time, damnit. Junghyeok: I'm about to do what's called a pro-gamer move"
84,"Dec 22, 2021","Dokja and Junghyeok already have that tacit understanding! I love how Dokja had an epiphany bc of Junghyeok's words, and I'm sure Dokja has some insight he can offer to Junghyeok as well. Can't wait for more of their teamwork in the future!"
84,"Dec 22, 2021",I'm loving the conversations between dokja and Junghyeok :)
84,"Dec 22, 2021","You forget, Dokja. Nothing can stop a fan who has read the whole series.   📚"
84,"Dec 22, 2021","Yup.. even after reading 200+ pages and I think 20+ chapters, I've completely forgotten about that damn skill.. its so good and stupid.. like yea he may not have talent but he suffers through the pain to ""understand"" the skill, thus understanding the the character, all those time he couldn't do it. he wasn't wasting time lol "
84,"Dec 22, 2021",Took him long enough to remember how OP his skills are. Bookmark is straight up busted now and later. 
84,"Dec 22, 2021",He finally realizes that he doesn't learn the way others do. He doesn't learn someone's skill: He learns THEM and then TAKES what he wants from them.
84,"Dec 22, 2021",this has got to be the longest day of Dokja's life 😂😂😂😂
84,"Dec 23, 2021","""Someone needs to buy me some time"" Junghyeok - Say no more."
84,"Dec 23, 2021",no one is talking about how his skill is fucking PRO GAMER??
84,"Dec 22, 2021","Yay! We’ll get to see Yu Jungyeok in action again, and fighting “with” Dokja instead of against him. Let’s do this!"
84,"Dec 22, 2021",I wish Junghyuk could step on me like that 
84,"Dec 22, 2021",Now THAT is how you make an entrance!😁 THE TIME IS NOW AS DOKJA AND JUNGHYEOK WORK TOGETHER AND FIGHT THE CATASTROPHE THAT THREATENS ALL OF KOREA!! Who would be victorious? Will enemies become frenemies ? Will ships sail?! Who knows as the journey continues….
84,"Dec 22, 2021",let's be honest he is only helping him because nobody is allowed to kill Dokja but him. Trolled him to the point he will protect him only so he can kill him 🤭🤣
84,"Dec 22, 2021","Dokja and Junghyeok always know what the other needs, and it's just akdjdjd SOULMATES!! SUPER EXCITED FOR THE NEXT UPDATE!"
84,"Dec 22, 2021",I wish my reading skill could help me this much in life 
84,"Dec 23, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" sighs with the late enlightenment of the incarnation ""kdj"".] [5 coins have been sponsored. ] //Edit: Merry Christmas guys 🎅"
84,"Jan 6, 2022","It's funny how Dokja and Joonghyeok are the only ones who can get through to each other at clutch moments when the rest of their conversations are literally just glaring, smirking, death threats and slapping"
84,"Dec 22, 2021",He remembered what he's naturally good at! #lesson
84,"Dec 22, 2021","[The constellation ""The Red King"" is fired up at the portrayal of reading and comprehending as a skill. 3000 coins have been sponsored. ]"
84,"Jan 26, 2022",Who needs to learn when they can just copy? 😂
84,"Dec 22, 2021",Why do I ship these two now?
84,"Dec 22, 2021",Dokja I've been yelling for the bookmark skill to be used. We're both stupid but we're readers. we always find a solution.
84,"Dec 22, 2021","I've been screaming at the MC to use his bookmarks, cause why else does he have them?🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️"
84,"Jan 26, 2022",glad that Dokja realized he was little bit arrogant .. 
84,"Dec 22, 2021",What an assist!!
84,"Jan 26, 2022","go bestie, defeat them with the 🌈power of friendship 🌈"
84,"Jan 26, 2022",THAT is a dramatic entrance 5/5
84,"Jan 26, 2022",Having read the actual novel almost makes this more immersive
84,"Jan 26, 2022",ah yes..a supportive boyfriend 😌
84,"Jan 26, 2022","gonna be honest, I probably ship them way too hard."
84,"Jan 26, 2022",i love how some people are just like “YJH STEP ON ME” like guys…have u seen how he stepped on tarzan returnee? r u sure u want him to step on you? 
84,"Jan 26, 2022",those are some long ass seven days
84,"Jan 26, 2022",tbh i also forgot that dokja had an ability to take other people's abilities by knowing them personally. it just goes to show that dokja isnt a perfect person and he always trys his best in most situations
84,"Jan 26, 2022",FINALLY THEY'RE NOT KILLING EACH OTHER
84,"Jan 26, 2022","I finished the novel, and thought the bromance was pretty real, but it wasn’t like its gonna be canon confirmed. Been a couple of months since I finished it. When something crashed into the catastrophe I thought it was gonna be Sangah, strong sexy female lead coming to save the day... nope. The bromance is real. "
84,"Jan 26, 2022",This means Junghyeok trusts Dokja so much that hes willing to fight a hopeless battle to stall for time
84,"Jan 26, 2022",Junghyuk understood the assignment 😱😱😱
84,"Dec 22, 2021","""What I'm good at?... Reading."" Yeah, me too Dokja 😂😂📖📖. Also Merry Christmas to everyone 🎄🎄(if you celebrate it) "
84,"Jan 26, 2022",I love how Junghyeok knew exactly what needed to be done. The bro bond is real.
84,"Jan 27, 2022",You know it’s love when he falls from the sky to stomp on your enemy’s head
84,"Jan 26, 2022",Now THAT is what i call a pro-gamer move 😏
84,"Dec 24, 2021",Can't believe I'm enjoying Junghyuk and Dokja together instead of Sangha and Dokja😭🖐️ THE BEST TEAM UP REALLY!!!
84,"Jan 26, 2022",I love both of them. They tried to kill each other but also support each other ❤️
84,"Jan 26, 2022","I liked the other translation of junhyeok saying, “I’ll hold him down.” Not, “I’ll stop him.” I think it hits better and describes it better."
84,"Jan 26, 2022","This is the most badass webcomic I have ever read. There are plenty of great comics on this site, but I feel like this one is seriously on its own level"
84,"Jan 26, 2022",junghyeok is so sexy and supportive in his own way . nothing but respect for MY (and twsa's) protagonist <3
84,"Jan 26, 2022",HE UNDERSTOOD THE ASSIGNMENT 
84,"Dec 22, 2021",Merry Christmas to those who celebrate it!!❤️
84,"Jan 26, 2022","""huh? did something fall from the sky?"" i mean, yea"
84,"Jan 26, 2022",Demonlike Judge of Fire is grinning with Kawaii eyes!

84,"Jan 26, 2022",🔨 Dokja 🔨 Junghyeok 🔨 ship 🔨
84,"Jan 26, 2022",Who called it that he’d need to bookmark lycaon to learn way of the wind
84,"Jan 26, 2022",It's cool that they showed that Dokja was acting pretty arrogant..I'm glad he realized it now than later. And wow Junghyeok's so cool tho this is probably the most he's been in a chapter
84,"Jan 27, 2022",Step on me too please
84,"Jan 26, 2022",LET'S F**KIN GOOOOOOOOOO 
84,"Jan 26, 2022",Eh i ship it. Edge lord looking out for his book worm
84,"Jan 26, 2022",We're getting the essence of the comic back! This episode feels like the early chapters of the Webtoon cuz he remembered that he's a reader 👌🏽👌🏽
84,"Dec 23, 2021",Dokja and Jungyeok team ups are always my favorite. PS Happy Holidays!!
84,"Jan 26, 2022",he can step on me…
84,"Jan 27, 2022","I love the the way all of these moments have been built up! How Dokja (and even me) forgot about using his reader skills and relied on other powers, how Junghyeok helps Dokja out to buy time. I loved it!"
84,"Jan 26, 2022","At first I thought ""man, Dokja is so stupid for forgeting about his skills"" but then I realized ""wait, I forgot about it too"". Now I'm the stupid one. "
84,"Jan 26, 2022",can't stop smiling 
84,"Jan 26, 2022",I love how this webtoon makes readers feel so powerful- including those who are reading the comic.
84,"Dec 22, 2021",finally the some main characters action lol

84,"Jan 26, 2022",oh to be stepped on by junghyeok
84,"Jan 26, 2022",he really is a main character look at that grand entrance
84,"Jan 26, 2022",I’m a little scared cause he hasn’t eaten or slept for quite some time….what happens if he fails the world quest?
84,"Jan 26, 2022",i wish yjh would step on me and look down on me like I'm piece of shit
84,"Jan 26, 2022","""I can fulfill what you lack""-"
84,"Jan 26, 2022",Is it just me or is that guy’s decency cloth slowly slipping down?
84,"Jan 26, 2022",YESS WERE FINALLY SEEING THEM TEAM UP BESIDES FIGHTINGG😭😭 btw i forgot he had the bookmark skill omg🚪🚶‍♀️
84,"Dec 22, 2021",Taking anything as a answer to one’s questions for power up is kind of cheap.  
84,"Jan 27, 2022",Damn I wish junghyeok would step on me too
84,"Dec 22, 2021",He understood that his mysterious boo needed him at that exact moment. The only thing he doesn't understand? His feelings for Dokja.
84,"Jan 27, 2022",Junghyeok cocky bitch look kinda good ಠ益ಠ 👀
84,"Jan 26, 2022",JOONGDOK TEAM FIGHT JOONGDOK TEAM FIGHT JOONGDOK TEAM FIGHT
84,"Jan 26, 2022",wait that was hot 
84,"Jan 26, 2022","YESSSS this is the moment i was waiting, when Dokja finally starts fighting using his skills, from now on theres little to no situations in wich i have to think ""this MC is an idiot for not doing this"" and I LOVE that, thats why i was so hype about something as little as him using bookmark, because its amazing and now he is gonna actively use it in every situation as he should"
84,"Jan 27, 2022","The first scenario where the ""Life and Death Companions"" fight alongside each other"
84,"Jan 26, 2022",This is going to be known as one of the greatest WEBTOONs when all is said and done (coming from a novel reader)

84,"Jan 26, 2022",oh they are a terrifying pair. 
84,"Jan 26, 2022",Been a while since we saw that skill.
84,"Jan 26, 2022",About time he started using his abilities properly.
84,"Jan 26, 2022",This chap is full of realizations..we are gonna step into sth new now folks 
84,"Jan 26, 2022","THESE TWO REALLY JUST HAD A POWER COUPLE MOMENT (you can choose if it’s platonic or romantic <3) AND HONESTLY?? GOOD FOR THEM ✨ Also, the artist/s (?) draw shoes so well???

84,"Dec 22, 2021","FINALLY- it always confused me as why exactly he didn't use any of this beforehand, he could have single handedly fuckjng destroyed pildu with reader man"

84,"Jan 27, 2022",why is this series SO GOOD
84,"Jan 27, 2022","I just notice, why Junghyeok's outfit looks like a priest outfit? Was he a priest in his first life?"
84,"Jan 27, 2022",That one constellation that ships them must be so excited
84,"Jan 27, 2022","If I want to pick up the novel from here, what chapter should I start at?"
84,"Jan 26, 2022",🎼 … he came in like a wrecking ball 🎶 🎵 
84,"Jan 26, 2022","i think its so powerful that dokja is making mistakes rn, he's been so big brain for most of the novel that its really gripping to see him be human too"

84,"Jan 27, 2022",mom and dad are back together after fighting 🥺🥺LMFAOO I GET WAY TOO ENTERTAINED BY PRETENDING JUNGHYEOK AND DOKJA ARE A COUPLE
84,"Jan 27, 2022",The fact they do not like each other all that much yet make the perfect team is great.
84,"Jan 27, 2022","Kinda late, but no one really points out the ""Midday Rendezvous"" which was translated as ""Midday Tryst"" on the novel, but close enough. It's just canon reading this chapter again."
84,"Jan 26, 2022","ey... I ship Dokja and Jungyeok, nobody can stop me."
84,"Jan 26, 2022","Dokja's real skill is the willingness to act.Even if he could use skills from those he understand, if he didnt have the determination to act then nothing would have changed. 
As a reader myself, i've seen and read of many life lessons in plenty of stories, but i cannot say that i actually did anything to change my life even after understanding the experiences of characters....... T-T 
It's never too late to change though, I hope this year, I can finally make a change in my life like Dokja did."

84,"Jan 27, 2022",It is just like Junghyeok to wait until Dokja proves he can use way of the wind before he tries to help.
84,"Jan 27, 2022",Is anyone else annoyed that Lycaon wasn't actually #4 in the list the first time it was shown? Because I was looking for him and he wasn't there.

84,"Jan 26, 2022","the first time I read the novel, I also forgot he has bookmark lol and honestly in this kind of situation I can hear ""it"" saying something like *ding* [k im d ok j ai s a n id i ot] *ding* [s tu p id ki m do kj a] etc etc"
84,"Jan 26, 2022",Jesus you MC's just have to make those dramatic entrances don't you?
84,"Jan 26, 2022",It's been a long time since Dokja has used the Viewpoint skill in fighting.
84,"Jan 26, 2022",THIS IS IT! I've been waiting for this three (imma include HSY since she's there too) to work together since I keep on seeing that they are an amazing trio.

This is my newer favorites from webtoon, and my second overall favorite probably after solo leveling. Who knows though I don't really like ranking them per se, each has something to offer to us readers"
84,"Dec 22, 2021","To whom it may concern sorry, my Bad. Saw someone mentioned taking a screen shot for wallpaper and I did just to see what the warning was .. loving the artwork for this. As a novel reader I’ve been super happy seeing the artistic interpretation. Thank you.  "

Dokja [in the shower] : Why are you here so early?! And how did you unlock the door?! //

Sooyoung: Eh? Dokja? Wait, then who is-? //

Yoo Jonghyuk: Say your prayers, bitch."
84,"Jan 27, 2022","Sooyoung told Dokja that anger can be separated into 3 categories and she can prove it. She called Jonghyuk’s number in a high-pitched voice, “Hello, is this Kim Dokja I’m speaking to?” //Jonghyuk replied over the phone, “Sorry, you called the wrong number.” He ended the call. //
Sooyoung said, “This is the first level of anger; surprise and curiosity.” //
Sooyoung redialed, “Hello, is this Kim Dokja I’m speaking to?”"
84,"Jan 27, 2022","How does the title of that one BL novel go again... ""The hero and the reader must be in love with each other""? 🤣🤣🤣"

Han Sooyoung: Too much salt."
84,"Jan 27, 2022",The shawty is back.
84,"Jan 27, 2022","Wait, does this mean Junghyeok knows about who he is now? Or are his words being so helpful and him being there right when Dokja thought to himself he needed a distraction all a coincidence?"
84,"Jan 27, 2022",Ya know I don’t think anyone has been eating three meals a day much less sleeping
84,"Jan 26, 2022",this is the bromance I'm here for 👀

84,"Jan 4, 2022","omg finally, a dream team!🤩"
84,"Jan 1, 2022","anyway, is there a way to tell webtoon when they mistranslated the webtoon? It irks me so much with how much mistranslation they did since it will ruin the explanation of the later chapters. Like even in the beginning Dokja always said that Junghyeok is the ONLY regressor, which mean the others are not, and Myung Ilsang is a returnees"
84,"Dec 29, 2021",Dokja be like a thief tho like a book thief who'd secretly pack all the books at the library and go home without anyone noticing
84,"Dec 27, 2021",every chapter never disappoints 
84,"Dec 24, 2021",It is refreshing to see Dokja not having all the answers and struggling for once. He can't always be at the top of his game. Character development also for Junghyeok.
84,"Dec 23, 2021","Junghyeok looked badass in that panel. And oh my gawd, they way they portrayed Way of the Wind"
84,"Dec 23, 2021",Totally did not let out a squeal at work when junghyeok popped up. I totally didn’t 
84,"Dec 23, 2021","I'll say it again, Junghyeok is HOT"
84,"Dec 23, 2021",Well Junghyeok can step on me anytime 😇
84,"Dec 22, 2021",Still 7 days!! Ooooooooooohweeeeee so good man! 
84,"Dec 22, 2021","This picture goes hard, feel free to screenshot- The illustrator drawing that scene of Junghyeok"
84,"Dec 22, 2021","I wonder just how many characters he can currently choose from? How many bookmarks he can have at one time? If he knows the characters well enough, then he could potentially have unlimited skills to use!"
84,"Dec 22, 2021",So Reading makes things That Seem to be gibberish into things That actually make Sense - sounds about right.
84,"Dec 22, 2021","""Do you think your a Constalation or something"" no but I created one !"
84,"Jan 27, 2022",I love how this is an action series but we’re all still shipping Dokja and Junghyeok
84,"Aug 6, 2022",Dokja: did something fall out of the sky?- Jungheok: I'm something 
84,"Aug 4, 2022",Junghyeok can step on me😇😇

84,"Jul 10, 2022",WHERE DID JUNGHYEOK COME FROM?
84,"Jul 8, 2022",(°_°) oh he's back... i thought he'd be out for two days did i got that wrong? ( ಠ◡ಠ ) finally working together eh?
84,"Jul 7, 2022",I'm getting a nosebleed-
84,"Jul 6, 2022",Yasss Dokja own that skill! And gosh Junghyeok! Can you chill? You're too hot 👉👈
84,"Jul 5, 2022","did he really forgot he has bookmark? that is how he beat the first guy, the vile white haired one lmao"
84,"Jul 5, 2022",he been thinking about new skills about what he should do but not about what he could do
84,"Jun 30, 2022",how could he forget his own skill? 😭😭
84,"Jun 26, 2022",NOO HIS FLUFFY LOOKING HAIR JUNGHYEOK GET OFF OF HIM HIS HAIRRRRRRRRRR
84,"Jun 23, 2022",Yesss Dokja!! Actually remembering what your skills are and how you need to fight like a reader!
84,"Jun 20, 2022","ok, how is it that when he asks for someone's name, he takes ""what?"" as an answer?"
84,"Jun 16, 2022",I think I’m crazy to think that junghyeok can step on me like that and I wouldn’t even complain one bit😭😭😭
84,"Jun 16, 2022",It's crazy how these to connect one is a character from a story and the other is a person who just read the story but yet they act like they are rivals and brother at arms
84,"Jun 14, 2022",got goosebumps😭
84,"Jun 12, 2022","Omg junghyeok is like ""Oh, so you know the future? Go fight the catastrofes while I look for the perfect moment to do an epic entrance"" "
84,"Jun 11, 2022",OOOOOO ITS HIM🫣
84,"Jun 11, 2022",Someone came to help his wifey once again we love it
84,"Jun 6, 2022",Did someone else remember that one comment before? lol they're literally 5 steps ahead of Dokja 
84,"Jun 5, 2022",I'm so glad he remeber'd that skill
84,"Jun 4, 2022",YAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYA NOW KISS

84,"May 17, 2022",Truly goosebump moment. A reader is good at reading. It’s so amazing and creative the way the author builds dokja.
84,"May 17, 2022",That was so cool
84,"May 16, 2022",boy might just step on me as well
84,"May 13, 2022",His timing is just- perfect 
84,"May 11, 2022",OMG THAT MOMENT WHEN YJH APPEARED THAT WAS SO COOL

84,"Apr 22, 2022",Best couple
84,"Apr 17, 2022",GO JUNGHYEOK HELP UR WIFE
84,"Apr 17, 2022",I get the feeling that the author knew our Reader and based the protagonist on who he thought the reader could be. I know it's a bit far fetched with given info but the author did say that our Reader was the reason why the author kept going and finished the story.
84,"Apr 16, 2022",Step on me too Junghyeok Yu 🧎‍♀️
84,"Apr 13, 2022",Go Preacher Man!!
84,"Apr 13, 2022",What so what happened to the wolf guy tho why isn’t he helping??
84,"Apr 12, 2022",Dokja forgetting his own freaking skill has the same energy as Deku not realising he can kick. Like damn for someone so smart you're very dumb lol
84,"Apr 12, 2022",I WANT TO BE IN THE PLACE OF THE GUY
84,"Apr 8, 2022",That guy Ilsang is such a creep. Happy to see his face get punched in. Hell yeah! I'm excited to see the skills that made Dokja so interesting and strong in the for was t place. It's not just his knowledge of the world but his ability to read his opponents and steal a character's skill. It's amazing seeing a loop hole into his lack of natural talent. He was never meant to have it because his own personal attribute would make up for it. Omniscient Viewpoint for the win!
84,"Apr 6, 2022",wow bestie really came in clutch.

84,"Feb 27, 2022","Well I guess that tells us the three ways to survive the apocalypse, you have to be one of the three, a regressor who is born again, a returnee who travels to other dimensions, or a reader who gains knowledge from the future. (I assume the author is someone who has gone back in time and who knows things about the future that no one else does. Though now that I think about it, who’s to say that Dokja isn’t the author himself who went back in time and wrote TWSA for himself?"

I keep forgetting that Dokja is the main character of this story but he's not THE main character of the story- that doesn't make sense but it also does because y'all have context yes. but my point is they reminded us about that here and there, but Dokja talking to Junghyeok there and him actually realising that he'd been arogant is so- phew. it hits you.

13,"Sep 2, 2020","They translated it as Returnee? Isn't he a Regressor?! It's fixed now! Thank you, translation team~"

13,"Sep 2, 2020",Well that was a short series
13,"Sep 2, 2020","I’ve seen a couple of people in the past comments that want Dokja to be this ruthless badass (probably thanks to comics like Solo-Leveling etc). Ironically, the protagonist these people seem to want is the “real protagonist” of TWSA, Yu Junghyeok. Ruthless. Badass. Good-looking. OP. Even a pro-gamer lol. Don’t expect Dokja to be like this, you guys."
13,"Sep 2, 2020",Bastard?! I want my “son of a bitch.”
13,"Oct 15, 2020","Everyone, be prepared for these two being such chaotic idiots/jerks to each other and still care so much. It’s gonna be great!"
13,"Sep 2, 2020",YJH!!!!!!! true love is dangling over a bridge in the sunset
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Thoze zombies just standing around while they're having a nice little chat 
13,"Sep 2, 2020",This would make an amazing anime
13,"Sep 4, 2020",And this dear readers is how the ship started
13,"Sep 3, 2020",Yoo Junghyuk is handsome like the Novel says... I’m happyAlthough our Dokja isn’t bad looking either 👌🏻
13,"Sep 2, 2020",Dang it... start a new series... get sucked in for the awesome art and story so far... then he gets eaten.... already loading up on coins cause imma be spending a lot on this just like The Gamer 
13,"Sep 2, 2020","was kinda hoping to see the last part translated to ""son of a bitch"" but its no big deal haha"
13,"Oct 15, 2020",*you have failed successfully*
13,"Oct 15, 2020","the constellation ""holy shit"" is surprised with this turn of events"
13,"Oct 15, 2020",bruh people that haven't read the novel are gonna have a real good time
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Everyone gangsta till the protagonist drops the protagonist.
13,"Oct 15, 2020",I love the love/hate relationship between them. Dokja’s always like I’m the one who knows you best so ofc I know you’re a complete psychopathic bastard!
13,"Sep 2, 2020","Wow, the translation team really work fast!  They’ve already changed it from returnee to regressor. Thank you so much 🤗"
13,"Oct 15, 2020","Not only are we getting a new chapter each day, BUT WE GET PAID FOR IT."
13,"Oct 15, 2020",idk why I smiled when dokja was falling.
13,"Oct 15, 2020",there was an article on naver that circulated on twitter yesterday. they're going to make this webtoon an animation w hundreds of episodes 😭😭 I'm so excited 
13,"Oct 15, 2020",he should've said sayonara mothafucka while falling
13,"Sep 2, 2020","ah dokja, the face you made when jonghyuk acknowledged you is just 👌 "

[Constellation ""Leiru"" is glad that Webtoon  listened to the fans and fixed the *Returnee* to Regressor]
❤️  ALSO!~ that was the longest chocking scene😂😂😂 (imagination going wild 😏🐸)"
13,"Oct 15, 2020","WAITTTT in the first chapter didnt Dokja say that there were more readers of TWSA, but only he completed till the end. SO THOSE OTHER READERS MAY BE PRESENT HERE. THEY DONT KNOW THE WHOLE THING BUT THEY SURELY KNOW THE BEGINNING..!! "
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Fast passers be so mad right now lol 
13,"Oct 15, 2020","I kinda like dokja bc he seems like not too much of a person with amazing abilities or redeeming qualities. He's legit just like any other person who happened to be the only one to read the novel. But at the same time he's sensible, rational, and quick-witted. That's why he's probs gonna find ways to manipulate everyone lmao"
13,"Sep 3, 2020",HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO ME!? What an amazing cliff hanger 😂😭 I'm absolutely in love with this story! 
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Oh...i love this ship so much that i often forget that it all started with murder attempt
13,"Oct 15, 2020",And they were companions. OMG! They were companions!
13,"Oct 16, 2020","Dokja: I knew that was going to happen, but still, f*ck you."

13,"Oct 15, 2020",When you choose the wrong dialogue and get the bad ending
13,"Jan 5, 2021","According to the novel, that is YJH's happy smile "
13,"Oct 15, 2020","thank god the new episode is coming out tomorrow, I would not be able handle this cliffhanger for a week🙏😂"
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Am I the only one that thinks the Regressor is REALLY REALLY COOL AND REEEEEEEALLY HOT?!
13,"Oct 15, 2020",zombies on the background while he was holding him like👁👄👁
13,"Oct 15, 2020",both men are friggin gorgeous in that close up eye panel
13,"Sep 7, 2020","Alrighty Translators. First of all, I love this web-novel. I read all 551 chapters of it in a week. I laughed, I cried and was torn apart by all the things that happened. 
But you need to fix the “Returnee” label and change it to “Regressor”. Those are two very different things and will confuse Webtoon only readers. But otherwise, solid job. This is some great art. "
13,"Dec 1, 2020",BRO THAT FACE YOO JOONGHYUK MADE BEFORE THROWING HIM IN IM- :0
13,"Oct 28, 2020",THE STORY OF ' COMPANIONS IN LIFE AND DEATH ' HAS STARTED 
13,"Oct 16, 2020",am i the only one that ships
13,"Oct 15, 2020","Man what an insane chapter! In my opinion, the most exciting so far. Dokja and Junghyeok and both such interesting characters!"
13,"Oct 15, 2020",I finished the novel before the webtoon came out and seeing the main cast and constellations makes me CRY 
13,"Oct 16, 2020","I'm a Korean.I want to share this news, so I can't speak English well, but I use a translator to post it.Even if it's strange, I hope you understand.It is said that this webtoon is preparing to produce about hundreds of animations scheduled to be produced in the 5th season of the drama series.Please click below for articles. It is only Korean.  https://www.donga.com/news/article/all/20201013/103375743/1"
13,"Sep 7, 2020",after reading the comments I kinda felt like we're similar to the  constellations
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Dokja? Die? hah in your dreams 
13,"Oct 19, 2020",The best way to start a good friendship sure is throwing your companion in a monster's mouth.
13,"Dec 13, 2020","YJH is such an asshole...but god I wanna make out with him, he's really hot"
13,"Dec 18, 2020",this guy had the audacity to smile while watching someone fall into sea serpent's mouth
13,"Oct 17, 2020",The Constellations are dissapointed u didn't give him the middle finger .l..
13,"Nov 8, 2021",Lol I like this Junghyeok dude
13,"Sep 2, 2021",fck the main character... not the main character but the main character you feel me
13,"Oct 19, 2020",Reading this after reading the novel is funny. 
13,"Oct 15, 2020",I guess they made the ‘update every day’ rule because the fan translation is more advanced so they are losing readers and need to catch up...
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Personal Skill [Plot Armor] Activated. You can now survive any cliffhanger.
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Did he just- die? Welp great series! See ya next year.
13,"Sep 2, 2020",I really am digging this. I enjoy the world building so far and like they reasoning behind his knowledge of events taking place. it feels unique but with similar aspects of series I truly adore.
13,"Sep 2, 2020",Please… YJH is a regressor not a returnee this is a very important distinction to make because of future plot points!!!
13,"Feb 13, 2021",yjh smiling? what a rare occurence... *screenshots*
13,"Oct 18, 2020",I am the worst reader... I am ashamed of myself... my damn fuyoshi ass... curse me cuz I'm shipping those 2 AND I DONT KNOW HOW TO STOP IT 😫 just ignore me y'all 😔

13,"Oct 15, 2020","They're giving 5 coins for reading this for 5 days, and I PREDICT that I will end up spending that on this webtoon xD "
13,"Oct 15, 2020","I'm a new reader and not a Korean and have never heard about this novel before.I wanted to read it and rediscover it for myself.But with the way the fans behave in the comment section, it has been difficult.Spoilers are dropped in like bombs.And the thing that bothers me more is how overexcited people are.Let people read for themselves and judge things,when you scream that it's sooo good,it makes people think it's overrated.Give the new readers time and head space,it'll be appreciated with time"
13,"Apr 8, 2021",lmao the zombies be like: 👁️👄👁️

13,"Oct 15, 2020",No one: 🦗🦗🦗 Me: *waiting for Dokja to acknowledge that the future won't be exactly the same if he's in the story so his view of the future could also be limited and lowkey getting anxiety because of it* 😳
13,"Oct 15, 2020",t-two updates???? *faints*
13,"Oct 15, 2020","To the people who love the story, it only gets better from here. I don't know how long the webtoon will be, but I imagine that it will double the amount of chapters in the webnovel because this episode would be chapter 6."
13,"Sep 24, 2021",this is still one of my favourite chapters. i have called my favourite characters bastards so often. and they are. i really love to see that relationship reflected with them

13,"Dec 31, 2020","Remember, the punishment for failure was ??? not death"
13,"Dec 12, 2020","Alright, so based on my understanding from these comments, Regressors are basically like, ""Ah shit I'm gonna die......welp, time to load my save file from the start before I die."" But instead its automatically regress before death. Basically like Return By Death from Re Zero minus the death part. Am I right? Please correct me if anyone reads this."

13,"Apr 9, 2021",gah dayum they both so fineee 🛐
13,"Apr 7, 2021","*sighs dreamily* this chapter is so great because you get so much info on both the situations and the personalities of the characters so naturally. Junghyeok seems to easily accept Dokja as his companion only to pull shit like this, asking him if he would drop him or not to test the validity of his claims. then Dokja brilliantly and begrudgingly says the answer he's so sure of—with some sass of course! then Junghyeok smiles as he, the crazy bastard, acknowledges Dokja and watches him fall."
13,"Mar 26, 2021",WHYS BOTH THE MCS SO HOT
13,"Mar 19, 2021","he could've made a creepy smile and told him something like ""i'll come back for u at night"" or ""ur face looks like cow shit"" but he just screamed all the way down lmao"

13,"Oct 15, 2020","clever lad. there was no way Junghyeok would save him without being convinced he's a prophet, BUT he knows that if Junghyeok is convinced he'll just regress and keep him from dying this time."
13,"Oct 15, 2020","i started reading the webnovel as i couldnt wait, and its great!"

13,"Oct 15, 2020","I hope the next episode he says ""I survived bitch"""
13,"Oct 15, 2020",My guess is that Junghyeok will repeat the scenario using his ability as a regressor and it will go smoothly because he has the information he needs about Dokja
13,"Oct 15, 2020",ha anyone would have known he would drop him no need to know the future
13,"Oct 15, 2020","I be here, complaining about the slightly different translation from what I'm used to. Like when Yoo Joonghyuk lets go of our dear main character, it sounded way cooler in the fan translation I read"

So like, there's this tiktok vid and the topic is currently being fussed about in orv twt. And like as a novel reader, I NEVER really questioned WHY yjh was ""smiling brightly"" when he first met kdj when he's supposed to be this cold, aloof guy with a nasty attitude. It all makes sense now because subconsciously, he finally met kdj after 1864 regressions when he made that decision back in the 0th turn😭😭🥺."

13,"Nov 13, 2020",Yoo Junghyuk kinda looks like a priest from those catholic churches.

13,"Oct 22, 2020",that was just wrong.. he got some nerve 😕 but.. why do I find that regressor cute though 🤔

13,"Oct 16, 2020",Isnt Regressor similar to Suburu’s (Re:Zero) Return to Death. They can repeat the past or something similar.i just want to know if Junghyeok went through any trauma because of his power.

13,"Oct 15, 2020","So i haven’t read this story so pls don’t spoil it for myself or other new readers but this is my theory. Main character knew the bridge would collapse if only one person crossed. Junghyuk CANT get across the bridge without Dokja!! And NOW he believes he’s a prophet. He’s gonna regress and keep him alive this time imo (again pls don’t spoil, just a theory. Thank you to the team working on this!!!)"

Or if he will return to the reality before all this happened. Could he still be alive in there with some skill to escape? Anyway, that guy just dumped the best asset imaginable in their universe into the jaws of a monster. More than being a psychopath, he’s his own worst enemy."

13,"Oct 16, 2020","okay so I havent fast passed and just read this all today but? imo it looks like the constellation he ignored completely saying it wasnt in the story n sounded weak is probably the author of it? like their idea for what would happen went through cuz they were able to keep a constant reader which marked theirs as the most likely one to hold participation or something, and they were like ""ah, my reader is using their powers right, nice"" and offer sponsorship to help? guess Ill find out "

Can't wait to see how they'll draw THAT chapter. 😭❤️"

13,"Sep 30, 2020",Lovin it! Haven't been this emotionally (or financially) invested in a Webtoon since The Gamer. Can't wait to see where it goes.
13,"Sep 27, 2020",damn outa coins  wtf I have to wait a whole  month  for the next episode  yeah that's not happening  imma buy some coins 
13,"Sep 23, 2020",To those future readers who are going to reread after the future chapters: You will be amazed why he tossed him down :')
13,"Sep 16, 2020",I only have 10 coins left in webtoon english from doing various events. ... I ended up using it all just so i can see yoo joonghyuk's face faster. 🤷🏻

13,"Sep 7, 2020",can’t believe i skipped all the other eps just so i can buy the chapter with yjh in it BLESS

13,"Sep 3, 2020","Why am I spending coins, because I feel guilty because i read the scanlations"
13,"Sep 2, 2020",Why are people saying they are using returned? I read regressor? But anyway I knew he was dangerous. 
13,"Sep 2, 2020",So now i either continue to use coins when the next chapter comes out or wait what roughly 2 months to read this for free..... oh whyy did i do this to myself
13,"Sep 2, 2020","Imagine being murdered by the protagonist of your favorite story. Like if I got merked by Harry Potter 5 minutes after I met him, I’d be a hot mess"
13,"Sep 2, 2020",Also in a way...we are all kind of like constellations/sponsors 😳
13,"Sep 2, 2020",Thank you for changing the term returnee to regressor! 
13,"Sep 2, 2020","webtoon: 5 fast passes is enough, right?
omniscient: ""more""

webtoon: ""but-""

omniscient:  "" I. SAID. MORE."""
13,"Sep 2, 2020","Whelp, looks like I'll be reading the story while waiting for more chapters here to be published. Haven't been this hooked in a long time 😍"
13,"Sep 2, 2020",No way that was a great cliff hanger ;)
13,"Sep 2, 2020","Junghyeok is a regressor, NOT a returnee. And this isn't just a mere translation error, since the two are completely different concepts that will affect the story greatly. Distinctions should be made between them for future plot points to make sense..."
13,"Sep 2, 2020",My boy really spent the whole episode being choked by a dude😏
13,"Sep 2, 2020",Dokja is going full Jonah I see.
13,"Sep 2, 2020","God I read the original text before and now to actually have faces to the characters make it fantastic. It’s exactly how I imagined it. This is a story I would be willing to pay money for, I’m giving you my coins every week until the end! "

13,"Oct 15, 2020",Everyone: Welp this was fun while it lasted rip Dokja / Me: But didn't one of them have the ability to reverse time to the beginning of the scenario or something like that?
13,"Oct 15, 2020","Bruhwtf, dude better rip apart this grade 7 snake and save my dude. Imagine Sun WuKong looking at Dokja and just facepalming himself."

13,"Oct 15, 2020",Looks like our protag will be saving him on his next playthrough. 😆
13,"Oct 15, 2020","What would be funny is if that Bastard ever in the future finds out the MC is not a prophet and the MC is like ""You expected I was a prophet? NO IT WAS I, DIO!""  "
13,"Oct 15, 2020",yo its so weird seeing him with emotions bruh this is better than the novel
13,"Oct 15, 2020",I would've yelled something epic or something that'll make him regret letting go while falling

13,"Oct 15, 2020",OMG PLEASE REVIVE HIM I WANT THE BADASSERY TO CONTINUEEEEE
13,"Oct 15, 2020",[The constellation 'Queen of Rabbits' has her jaw dropping and is silently cursing]
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Will he spend the next scenario in the stomach of the ichthyosaur sea serpent? 🤔
13,"Oct 15, 2020","well, shit"
13,"Oct 15, 2020",WWWWWHHHAAAATTT!!!!!
13,"Oct 15, 2020",from what I have seen from the comments there's a story before this one so if someone can tell me where to read that I would greatly appreciate it 
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Bippity boppity fucc you and this property
13,"Oct 15, 2020",For those who are still confused on what a regressor is. It means when he dies he can go back in time to the start of the apocalypse. He also will still have his stats and skills so you can bet he would be a beast if he keep regressing. 
13,"Oct 15, 2020",He’s kinda FINE tho 🤭 and he’s also a bastard holy crap. 
13,"Oct 15, 2020","But his knowledge changes too just like a Regressor, as things change his information on the future also no longer applies, so no he's not a prophet at all. xD He's basically like a Regressor but who was omniscient and reading through his past life before this one."
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Companion GET! 
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Just like that Kim Dokja knew he was ✨fxcked✨
13,"Oct 15, 2020","Well, that was certainly shorter than the in-world version of this comic. Let's head home, everyone!"
13,"Oct 15, 2020",I'm assuming he survives 
13,"Oct 15, 2020",lol his bridge is gonna collapse 😌
13,"Oct 15, 2020",......the end?
13,"Oct 15, 2020",thank you so much for updating TWO episodes this week!!!!! You are officially my new favorite auther :)
13,"Oct 15, 2020",lmaooo what? 
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Can’t wait for this to become a series in Netflix 
13,"Oct 15, 2020",yjh u bastard ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
13,"Oct 15, 2020",well you can do an Eren or Naruto or any anime who got eaten by a monster 
13,"Oct 15, 2020",😳 
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Well it was a wild and short run this one 
13,"Oct 15, 2020","If weren't for the coin i won't mind reading omniscient in here in the webtoon, bucz it's so behind, this manhwa series existed few months ago before release in the webtoon.. the latest chapter in manga sites is chapter 26 ..And btw this series is the same studio of other manhwa/webtoons like Solo Leveling, Tomb raider King and great mage returns after 4000 years,""Redice studio"" "
13,"Oct 15, 2020","See, now there's a proper explanation for the original Protagonist. All of you in the last chapter kept spoiling things under the pretense that it was ""already explained"" it wasn't. They only labeled him as Regressor.
Anyways, I'm curious as to where everyone else will go now without dokja... I don't know how willingly helpful junghyuk might be with them 😢"
13,"Oct 15, 2020","Anyone else get some serious Purple Hyacinth vibes from this?-long coat

13,"Oct 15, 2020",ok this was a good webtoon while it lasted nice knowing u guys
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Oof
13,"Oct 15, 2020",YJH...I love him already. Gave Dokja a nice opportunity to show off his skills and he didn't even know it.
13,"Oct 15, 2020",im broke I have to wait 23 hours I'm so sad its so good TT3TT
13,"Oct 15, 2020",OMG WAAAAAAAAAT..... I'm completely freaking dumbfounded.
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Soooo I’m guessing this is where the bookmark comes in?
13,"Oct 15, 2020",I'm a prophet. I read it in korean which has way more released 🤗🤗 but I'm much better at English (I understand 97% of what I read in Korean but that 3% 😭) so I'll reread to make sure I understood everything correctly.

13,"Oct 15, 2020",ＩＣＯＮＩＣ。(人 ´∀｀)
13,"Oct 15, 2020",I wonder if being a regressor makes him psychopathic because why bother to care about people if you are just going to game the system.

13,"Jan 22, 2022","I'm confuse, if he's just a normal dude(the protagonist) how he knows everything, he's not regular dude who lived in this world, right, he only existed because of the novel, he never been born in this universe, he's just a fictional character here. wait a minute, so you are saying that only his memory is from future, i mean he have memories of his future self delivered to him by himself in future or something like that, so now you're saying he's living in a loop, hhhhh"
13,"Jan 22, 2022",Idk but tht scene reminded me of the one from balance unlimited when Daisuke watched Haru drop from the bridge while smiling 😂😂
13,"Jan 20, 2022",Then technically I’m also a prophet because I can skip to later episodes

13,"Jan 1, 2022",They didn’t reveal what punishment were attributed to the people who failed so he’s prolly not going to die (even more because he’s the main character. I’m just saying the cost from losing this scenario isn’t death)

13,"Oct 15, 2020","Damn it, he should have given him the middle finger 😂😂😂"
13,"Oct 15, 2020",huh? 😀
13,"Oct 16, 2020",I 👏SHIP👏 IT👏
13,"Oct 15, 2020",don't they look similiar 
13,"May 21, 2022",heyy im a prophet too yk! my future is that im gonna be Joonghyuk 's future wife!
13,"Oct 29, 2021","he could tell the protagonist (idk their names yet, too lazy to go back and see -edit- it's junghyeok -edit end- ) that he used to be a constellation and that's why he knows, or something like that. him being a reader is kinda the same thing as being a constellation (excluding the abilities and gifts or whatever the constellations give to the players they sponsor - if that was what it was called) [i am halfway through this chapter]"
13,"Oct 17, 2020","That is why I always like the supporting characters more. zoro>>luffy, khun>bam, yami>asta, vegeta>goku, bakugo>midoriya, jiraya>naruto, ESCANOR>meliodas and so on. Most of the MCs are insane assholes Or just unbearably stupid like this guy(the supposed actual MC of TWSA).Glad that the other guy is the real MC for us."
13,"Oct 16, 2020",bitsh the anxiety this episode gave me
13,"Oct 16, 2020",DID DOKJA JUST DIE
13,"Oct 16, 2020",That Yunghyeuk (or however u spell it) is exactly like me
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Subaru Natsuki is here 
13,"Oct 15, 2020",so he'll turn back time to bring him back.that must've hurt though
13,"Oct 15, 2020",imagine this guy yoo jonghyuk having an arguement with sung jin-woo from solo leveling and kim dokja caught in the middle of them lol
13,"Oct 15, 2020",He's dead???
13,"Oct 15, 2020",I'm excited!!!!!
13,"Oct 19, 2020",I don't like this protagonist
13,"Sep 2, 2020",everyone complaining about the translation: shush
13,"Jan 24, 2022",WHOA I KNEW THEY WERE GONNA ACT SUS AS THEIR RELATIONSHIP PROGRESSES BUT I NEVER THOUGHT THAT THE FRUITY TENSION WOULD COME THIS EARLY LMFAOOO
13,"Oct 16, 2020",is this the last episode ? i am confused
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Why do I ship it...? *sweats* And why is the mean bean so handsome? ÚwÙ 
13,"Apr 7, 2022","this protagonist guy is insufferable, so fucking annoying"
13,"Jun 8, 2021",The protagonist of TWSA really reminds me of Wilbur Soot for some reason.
13,"Oct 15, 2020",??????????!!!!!!!!You call this a cliffhanger????!!!!!!!!!!!! p.s it's bad writing to kill off the main in the beginning of the series or any other part except the end-forgive me if my original comment was misread but I meant that authors usually don't do that so the mc can't die just yet
13,"Oct 16, 2020",1st of all why are there so many people correcting the text? You're just being jerks you know what's happening so it doesn't matter. 2nd of all YALL JUST GONNA IGNORE THE FACT THAT DOJKA PROBABLY JUST DIED LIKE U H H H H
13,"Sep 2, 2020",anyone else getting solo leveling vibes from this episode ? 
13,"Aug 3, 2021",I never hated an MC so much this week
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Ewww Webtoon is trying to catch up with Scanlation websites which has 30 chapters translated already... Don't buy fast pass guys before webtoon team catch up with scanlation 
13,"Oct 20, 2020",This is some AOT stuff just replace the Titans with a gyrados lol eating the main character like that
13,"Oct 16, 2020","My brain: please don't say it, don't you dare to say it, don't, STOP!Me:... I ship them now"
13,"Apr 28, 2021",Scum. I hope he dies and dokja takes his place.
13,"Oct 15, 2020",Just a heads up this WEBTOON is free and on further chapters on manga sites
13,"Mar 2, 2022",dislike both mc and protagonist(dont do a batman when you are not as cool asshole);.  if this goes on in the next few chapters am gonna stop reading.
13,"Oct 16, 2020",Anyone can explain the ending of the webnovel? I finished read it now. I kinda didn't understand it.It truly is a never ending story
13,"Oct 19, 2020","Well, I sure know who I'm going to HATE....😠"
13,"Oct 15, 2020",✨editing this so no one will know why this was disliked✨ (aNoThEr EdIt SiNcE my prediction was right lol but anyways no one will read the unedited version again ehehe this comment was so old-)
13,"Oct 16, 2020",This is Chinese manga so no copy right ! Don’t spend and read here :) 
13,"Oct 15, 2020",guys this is serious read thhis webtoon here https://toonily.com/webtoon/omniscient-readers-viewpoint/it is the same thing except its far 13 chapters ahed and it updates daily

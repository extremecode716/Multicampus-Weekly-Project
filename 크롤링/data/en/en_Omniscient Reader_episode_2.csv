Episode,Date,Review
2,"Aug 19, 2020",Cue final boss music 
2,"Aug 19, 2020",This is a great webtoon with great art and plot with a lot of panels that leaves it fans satisfied but always craving for more... Webtoon really had outdone itself this time finding a webtoon as good as this!!!
2,"Aug 19, 2020",Webtoon the platform for all the best webtoons thx so much webtoon!!!
2,"Aug 19, 2020","""Your free trial of living has ended"""
2,"Aug 19, 2020",accurate description of  2020 ending
2,"Aug 19, 2020",So basically he’s us readers rn but more op
2,"Aug 19, 2020","I have a question, Will this webtoon have 3146 episodes?"
2,"Aug 19, 2020",The fact that the dude kept writing with only one reader should serve as inspiration to all artists 😂😂
2,"Aug 19, 2020","Dokja seems really likable. He follows a series for 10 years and is personally contacted by the author and the dude’s just like, “I hope it’s a $50 gift card!”"
2,"Aug 19, 2020",At least he gets top comment everytime
2,"Aug 19, 2020","If this turned into an anime adaptation, it would be a banger 👌"
2,"Aug 19, 2020",GUYS FOR THOSE WHO HAVENT READ THIS... YOU BETTER DO IT IS SO GOOD!!! Also pls no spoilers
2,"Aug 19, 2020",Imagine this webtoon does the exact same thing0_0
2,"Aug 19, 2020","The parallels from the novel no longer being free and their world ending their “free trial” period, mwah *chefs kiss*"
2,"Aug 19, 2020",It's interesting way to look at life. We all live in nonfiction yet many of us long to see the other genres presented in our lives. So we deisgn or build or imagine and create our own universes through art forms to bring those other genres to life. Definetly a very cool perspective. 
2,"Aug 20, 2020","""I want to support the author by donating... but I'm struggling to make ends meet, so i'll just leave a comment instead.""thank you author-nim! I'm broke too so i'm just leaving this comment here~ 😭😭"
2,"Aug 19, 2020",Did they just say free planetary service has ended?😩😩😩 they should have called this 2020
2,"Aug 20, 2020",Dokja: If this was a fantasy comic then I would be the protagonist. Me: (checks genre and sees that it’s action) well I guess you’re not the protagonist 🤷‍♀️
2,"Aug 20, 2020","The mc's lucky he said he didn't want the app name, Duolingo would have another victim"
2,"Aug 19, 2020",The story really pulls you in doesn't it?
2,"Aug 19, 2020","Every time I read something in Spanish, It sets me off hahahaha, it just catches me off guard and because I'm a native speaker, I still don't get used to see Spanish in an English cómic/Webtoon"
2,"Aug 20, 2020","This i soooo good!! Now I understand the value of the gift that the author of TWSA gave to Dokja. As he is the only one who read till the end of the story, he is the only one who knows what will happen from now on. But, as now the story is pay content, for the people to survive they must pay for the info. Dokja has a clear advantage over all of them, thats why the last episode said that ""if you reached till the end you WILL survive"""
2,"Aug 19, 2020",There is 17 episodes out and there is a light novel with over 500 chapters
2,"Aug 19, 2020",is anyone else full on simping for mc over here
2,"Aug 19, 2020",I'm guessing the author of the webnovel was writing a story of how things would go after the free trial period of earth is over? and whoever got one reader to read the whole story wins and his/her novel becomes reality. OR MAYBE I'M OVERTHINKING LOL
2,"Aug 21, 2020",this is probably one of the best series i i’ve ever read. i’m reading the light novel rn and let me tell you it’s so godly. like the character development and everything is amazing. i won’t say anything else so i won’t spoil it for people but you also need a big brain to understand everything from chapter 200 so make sure you understand :)
2,"Aug 19, 2020","""Your free trial of life has ended"""
2,"Aug 19, 2020","Looks like their free living trials ended, they’ll have to make separate accounts to survive now"
2,"Aug 28, 2020","Here, Dokja says I have to live my own life. In the novel, he says Dokja should live a Dokja's life. Dokja is both his name and also means reader. So basically he believes he should just be a passive observer like a reader instead of solving problems and moving forward as the protagonist would. It's an interesting dialogue that shows Dokja's state of mind. I wish the translators kept the wordplay."
2,"Aug 24, 2020","Can you imagine reading a series for ten years, and the last episode is just, “Whelp, good luck out there! Bye!.”"
2,"Aug 22, 2020","The part where he was talking about how long he's been following the series for, and the moments in his life where it was important. I can really relate to that. I've been reading webtoons since 2016. Since I started a new school. When I went through the death of my best friend. When I finished school.. I became a qualified Florist this year.  Webtoons has been a big part of my life since then. Even other series that are not on the webtoon platform. They have all been a big part of my life."
2,"Aug 19, 2020","paid content... does that mean...
BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD
BLOOD is needed for you to read the next chapter. please insert blood into the bottom of your device."
2,"Aug 24, 2020",Your free trial of living has ended
2,"Aug 29, 2020","In the Novel, didn't Dokja say "" I'll have to live my own dokja (Reader) life,"" and then Sangah said, "" Then I'll live my own Sangah(Ivory) life!""  right???  "
2,"Aug 26, 2020","Man, just me who thinks that Dokja is hot??? 😆👉👈"
2,"Aug 25, 2020","""3 ways to survive 2020""1. stay at home
2. wear face mask
3. vote wisely
 (‘◉⌓◉’)"
2,"Aug 25, 2020",I don’t why but I got so emotional when the author said “Thank You” to Dokja. It’s like.. he’s his only hope and inspiration to making a story that no one else could appreciate.
2,"Aug 20, 2020","when you don't go to isekai, the isekai comes to you"
2,"Sep 3, 2020","whenever he was talking about just being a reader, it kinda felt like he was taking shots at me. now I kinda feel degradedalso I can tell this will be my favorite, cause you don't know how many times I have wished I was in a webtoon scenario"
2,"Aug 20, 2020","Dokja would've been the cool popular guy in a romance webtoon or even the kind childhood friend of the heroine, based on physical appearance alone hahahaha I don't know why he thinks he ain't a cute snacc"
2,"Jan 10, 2021",Moving his phone out of her line of sight is what really connects me to this dude
2,"Aug 19, 2020",this is the best  beginningI ever read
2,"Jan 28, 2021","They really just got ""Your Free Trial Of Living Has Just Expired"" huh"
2,"Aug 24, 2020","Great, we forgot to pay rent for Earth."
2,"Aug 22, 2020","If this had 3,000 episodes, which I know probably won't happen cause most webtoons have 200-500 episodes. And it would take me 10 years to read, I would read every single episode. Like honestly I would. I'm already addicted to this lol"
2,"Aug 20, 2020",sO u SeE tHe ApP i UsE iS cAlLeD dUoLiNgO
2,"Jun 26, 2021","""everyone is a protagonist in their own life"" [Wrong] . ""everyone can be a protagonist if they become the one and only reader of a 3000 chap novel"" [Correct] ✓"
2,"Apr 26, 2021","""I read web novels while Sangah studied"" this is truly calling me out but I'mma keep reading this haha"
2,"Aug 25, 2020",I bet the app she’s using is Duolingo
2,"Sep 12, 2021","Spoiler (Seriously don't read unless you've read like 10 chapters up at the very least): So I was rereading the series and I just realied that the contest/award TWSA won could've been something made by the constelations or someone else and that decided what would happen to the world. So maybe there's a society that decided ""Hey let's turn the earth into a death novel"" and basically they needed a plot so TWSA was put into the contest and it ended up winning."
2,"Apr 26, 2021","SO WEBTOON, ARE U SAYING THAT U GONNA PAY ME COINS FOR READING MY FAVORITE WEBTOON OF ALL TIMES? WELL U DONT HAVE TO SAY IT TWICEEE, HERE I GO"
2,"Aug 30, 2020","I just realized that the other story he was reading was written by Singshong, the author of this lol"
2,"Aug 29, 2020","""Your free trial of breathing is over"" in a nutshell"
2,"Aug 28, 2020",there's nothing wrong with going to a third-rate college guys 😭
2,"Aug 25, 2020",when you want to read the webtoon inside a webtoon to find out where this webtoon goes...

2,"Apr 26, 2021",First time reading this. It’s already so good.Lol
2,"Jan 6, 2021","New readers, this shit is better than unOrdinary, I can't stress enough how awsome of a story you'll miss if you skip this."
2,"Aug 22, 2020",Moral of the story: Never agree on paid content.
2,"Aug 19, 2020",This webtoon DEFINITELY has potential to surpass the popularity of Solo Levelling 💯 
2,"Aug 19, 2020",your present is to die!!! rattatattaa
2,"Apr 20, 2022","Fun fact: the novel dokja has on his phone when sangah asks him what he’s reading is “The World After the Fall”, which now has a manhwa available to read on webtoon! :)"
2,"Mar 25, 2022",“It was a story written for me and only me.” Bro…you have no idea 😭
2,"Oct 7, 2021","Dear Humanity, Earth has now become paid content."
2,"Apr 26, 2021","see, now I'm afraid to reach the ending of this webtoon"
2,"Jan 25, 2021",Everybody gangsta until the Epilogue says the protagonist dies 
2,"Aug 30, 2020",so their life was just a spotify free trail?
2,"Aug 24, 2020",Came here for coins. Dont care about them anymore cuz this is such a great webtoon lol.

2,"Apr 26, 2021",I came for the coins. Staying for the plot. This seems pretty interesting ngl 
2,"Mar 16, 2021",I could also tell you the name of the app she uses... it's 'Duolingo'.
2,"Jan 14, 2021",All these people speculating about the story but I’m trying to figure out how the same dude got all three top comments?!?
2,"Jan 6, 2021",no one's talking about the art tho— its a pure masterpiece itself haha
2,"Oct 16, 2020",Your free subscription of living has come to an end. Have a nice day :)
2,"Oct 15, 2020",“I read web novels while Sanga studied Spanish” you gotta call out your readers like that? 😭
2,"Sep 23, 2020","ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the f*cking show"
2,"Sep 19, 2020",How 2020s gonna end 
2,"Sep 6, 2020","You won't be single anymore, hot dude named dokja"
2,"Aug 27, 2020",he wish he got that 50$ gift card instead lol
2,"Aug 26, 2020",A bit of math. 3149 episodes would mean that the author posted a new chapter every day except on Sunday's for 10 years. Well I know what I will be reading for the next 10 years lol
2,"Aug 24, 2020","Yo, nobody gonna talk about the guy in the orange hoodie? As soon as Sanga show up, my man in the orange hoodie got up and left his seat that was right next to Dokja. Orange hoodie guy is low key best stranger wing man. Now jokes aside, this is looking to be a really good webtoon"
2,"Aug 14, 2021",Let’s hope this doesn’t just get one view. 😅
2,"May 1, 2021","I only started reading this because it looked cool, but I am just thinking in my head, “HOW DID I NEVER START READING THIS BEFORE!?!?” This should be made into a tv show!"
2,"Apr 30, 2021",💀💀💀 Imagine earth forgetting to pay for the subscription. loollllllll.
2,"Apr 28, 2021",If I'm being honost I started this to get free coins but I'm literally falling in love with this comic. 
2,"Apr 27, 2021",I feel like several episodes later we're gonna be like: WE NEED AN ANIME FOR THIS
2,"Apr 26, 2021",not to like ... restate one of ORV's main themes but I love rereading . reading a story again and finding new things to love is so incredible . 
2,"Apr 26, 2021",Your free trial off life is expired please stand by
2,"Nov 11, 2020",Your free version of life has just expired. Please buy the full version or die.
2,"Sep 10, 2020",Dokja looks similar to that Solo leveling MC (I forgot his name xD).. anyway I'm so looking forward for this webtoon. and probably gonna check the webnovel as well. Thank u author
2,"Sep 1, 2020",I feel solo leveling vibe in here ^_^
2,"Aug 29, 2020",They really said “your free trial of life has ended smh”
2,"Aug 19, 2020",She be using duolingo 
2,"Aug 19, 2020",Holy crap this art is amazing!!!
2,"Apr 23, 2022",Who else is re-reading? probaly my third to fifth time.
2,"Dec 6, 2021","The author really went “Fuck everyone else, Dokja gets to survive”"
2,"Sep 22, 2021","oh dang, so life on earth is free content?? love that concept"
2,"Aug 7, 2021","hate him or Love him, Dokja is no simp. "
2,"Jun 12, 2021",I'm currently reading the novel version and dang it's a pure MASTERPIECE
2,"May 4, 2021","People  of  Earth,  your  attention  please.This  is  Prostetnic  Vogon  Jeltz  of  the  Galactic  Hyperspace  Planning   Council.As  you  will  no  doubt  be  aware,the   plans  for  development  of  the  outlying  regions  of  the  Galaxy  require   the  building  of  a  hyperspatial  express  route  through  your  star  system,and  regrettably  your  planet  is  one  of  those  scheduled  for  demolition.   The  process  will take slightly less  that  two  of  your  Earth  minutes. Thank you."
2,"Apr 29, 2021","So, if he hadnt read it, everyone would be fine 😂😂"
2,"Apr 27, 2021",and I wasn't supposed to become addicted to this yet I am.... and its only the first proper episode 😓
2,"Apr 27, 2021",My new goal as a webtoon reader is being like Dokja and leave a comment in every episode of a webtoon that I really enjoy so the authors would feel supported.
2,"Apr 26, 2021","I actually understand him. There was a web comic that I had been reading and people kept complaining about how slow it was. After I posted a comment that people should just keep reading because it was building up, they stopped complaining and kept reading, I think. Basically, even if a story seems slow, if you stick with it, it might turn out better than you originally thought."
2,"Apr 26, 2021",rereading this masterpiece again <3
2,"Apr 26, 2021",I think the author jus called me out right there lol I’ve decided to read this instead of studying......And Would I do it again? Bettt😂
2,"Apr 26, 2021","Man, I feel like I'm being called out by the author. You know, with my life style of reading webtoons. ; - ; We're all being called out. Except we really are just Readers. I wonder if he's saying, create your own story! Live life how you want to live it."
2,"Apr 26, 2021",I too read webtoons when i should be studying with others
2,"Mar 3, 2021",IT IS LITERALLY YOUR FREE TRIAL OF LIFE HAS ENDED
2,"Jan 16, 2021",Why do i see the same kind of art style from solo leveling?Is the illustrator of this the same from the illustrator of the solo leveling mahnwa? 
2,"Jan 6, 2021",bro made me sad. instead of studying I'm reading this. xD
2,"Nov 23, 2020",Anyone notice how all three of the top comments are by bruce1234567 lol
2,"Sep 3, 2020",I like how the mc doesn't be simping like the mc of Dice 
2,"Sep 3, 2020",This dude really hit em with the “your free trial of life has now been expired”
2,"Aug 29, 2020",TWSA sounds like one piece with its sheer volume of chapters and never ending story
2,"Aug 29, 2020","I can relate to this guy kind of. I just turned 25 and I'm still reading webtoon and manga. I'm also serving in the military, and I have this fear or more like embarrassment of people finding out I'm reading webtoon haha "
2,"Aug 29, 2020","Woah I even read webtoons when I failed my test, during lunch, at home, while studying and also when no one tlks to me (: "
2,"Aug 28, 2020",*train gets derailed*Dokja: Don’t worry. It’s probably nothing.
2,"Aug 27, 2020",i have a strong feeling that : tls = The Last Survivor  and he wrote to the past to try and warn ppl  
2,"Aug 20, 2020","""Dokja can mean the only child, reader or an individualist"", such symbolism, I really like the explanation to the meaning of his name. I'm sure he will be one strong and reliable protagonist. Now the mysterious author of the novel uses the username TLS123, I wonder if that actually mean anything at all? TLS... The Laughing Stock? True Love Shines? The Last Survivor? Thy Lord and Savior? Lol, I'm probably reading a bit too hard into this xP"
2,"Aug 15, 2022","Rereading this again for the funnies, I love this webtoon and novel sm <3 "
2,"Dec 27, 2021","I remember reading this episode at first and being so confused with the amount of information, specially with all these cuts mid-sentence, I had a hard time keeping up lol. Cool to come back here and realize it's not that overwhelming as I thought it was now that I have more context. I missed on so many things back then, no wonder I kept mixing up the characters later on 🤡"
2,"Dec 26, 2021",I wish I found this sooner.
2,"Nov 1, 2021","Dam it really is a ""Your free trial of life has expired"" scenario"
2,"Sep 1, 2021","""i'm no protagonist"" haha you thought.. (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
2,"Aug 14, 2021",I love this comic . Thank you author
2,"Jul 25, 2021",Bruh I read the novel; I didnt expect for there to be a webtoon. Cool!
2,"Jul 25, 2021",this is a cool webtoon! :O
2,"Jul 5, 2021",Holy shit. Just started reading this webtoon and it’s really amazing. Was hooked in by chapter 0
2,"Jul 2, 2021","Well, I bet he gets top comment every week"
2,"Jun 25, 2021",y'all think this could also happen to our world?
2,"Jun 23, 2021",don't you just hate it when a disembodied voice tell you your free trial in live have come to an end? a whole planet non the less
2,"Jun 10, 2021","glad this has a lot of views, and has not been going on for 10 years"
2,"May 19, 2021","All I could think of was "" Your free trial to life has expired """
2,"May 19, 2021",Who names their kid “only child” 😭😭
2,"May 4, 2021",The app crashed while I was reading this chapter. This is very concerning
2,"Apr 27, 2021",I feel like this would be so dope as an anime
2,"Apr 26, 2021",re-reading because of the event.. dokja was so soft and cute back then 🤗 now he's just a real badass 😱😁
2,"Apr 26, 2021","I was reading this on the train it feels so self aware lol, because it's just me on the train reading a webtoon about a guy reading a webnovel on the train "
2,"Apr 26, 2021",I'm always so excited when its an adult protagonist! Teen series are fine but it's great being able to relate to a character again
2,"Apr 26, 2021",One piece readers right now must be upset their genre didn’t change
2,"Apr 2, 2021",“Your free trial of living has expired”
2,"Mar 24, 2021","The thing that hurt me the most was that ""I read webnovels while Sangha studied"""
2,"Mar 4, 2021",The psychological plot way the author used to make the mc the center of focus is phenomenal...
2,"Mar 3, 2021",Does anyone else think he looks like sung jin woo???
2,"Feb 24, 2021",BRUHHH THIISSS IS SOOO COOL... the art style = REALLYY GOODconcept planetary subscription: funny buttt THE BEST HAHAHAAHAHAH
2,"Feb 3, 2021","it has the same art style as the ""Solo Leveling"" its good"
2,"Jan 11, 2021","if there are 3149 chapters after 10 years, does that mean the author updated almost everyday?"
2,"Dec 21, 2020",basically if God was EA
2,"Oct 20, 2020",1st episode and it already pulled my full interest! What’s gonna happen? 😱
2,"Oct 15, 2020",imagine if you were reading attack on titan even if you were an adult and suddenly it becomes your lifestory
2,"Sep 24, 2020",did he actually text this mf and let him know 5 minutes ahead of time that his free trial of living was over
2,"Sep 24, 2020",Good Thing You Didn’t Learn Spanish 
2,"Sep 1, 2020",this art style is so similar to solo leveling and i love it
2,"Aug 29, 2020",Lmfao they really said ur whole planets free trial has come to an end 🤣
2,"Aug 26, 2020",i bet the girl is studying spanish using duolingo haha
2,"Aug 25, 2020","hahaha this author wants the readers to read this particular webtoon. Implying that ""this is a great webtoon! If you don't read my greatness, this particular scenario might happen to YOU!!!"" --- please. Whatever happens, I'm just an NPC. And I'll be the merchant type saying, ""OHHH NOOOO! NOT MY CABBAGES!!!"" hahahahahaha"
2,"Aug 25, 2020",Hearing Spanish makes me think about duo lingo. That owl will be the death of me...
2,"Aug 23, 2020","literal ""You're free life trial has ended now"""
2,"Aug 22, 2020","To the people reading this amazing webtoon, this is made by the same studio as Solo Leveling!! "
2,"Aug 22, 2020",just a question will there be 3000+ chapters/episodes of this webtoon?
2,"Aug 21, 2020",We finally know what the first paragraph of Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World.
2,"Aug 21, 2020",Wait this man has all top 3 comments!? ...well obviously this man is the protagonist of this genre.
2,"Aug 20, 2020","w-what if after we read this entire webtoon, it happens😳 omg "
2,"Aug 20, 2020",That reminds me that Duolingo keeps notifying me to do my lessons *sigh*^_*
2,"Aug 20, 2020",SHE USES DUOLINGO B E T
2,"Aug 20, 2020","Damn Dokja shouldn't have declined that language app, now the Duolingo owl is going to destroy the world 😔"
2,"Aug 20, 2020",uhhhhhh did you guys notice how the top three comments are the same person which is clearly favoring webtoon....almost like promoting it..or am i just crazy?
2,"Aug 20, 2020","What Dokja brought up was interesting though. He was considered an unsuccessful 'nobody' in a normal world, but then does a 180 and completely thrives in this fantasy (action?) world. "
2,"Aug 20, 2020",".... I feel personally and deeply attacked by this chapter ē.ē As a person who has daily read fanfictions for the last decade, I stand for you Dokja ! There is nothing wrong to like reading them (or web novels in your case). Some stories are just a better place than reality and it's always a pleasure to support authors. (/ °^°)/"
2,"Aug 20, 2020","""But this story in particular is very special to me."" ~ Me, everytime one of my favorite Webtoons end."
2,"Aug 19, 2020",I’m definitely in for this ride. 👍🏻 
2,"Aug 19, 2020",“i have to live my own life” ???? did they rly have to butcher the translation like that😭😭
2,"Aug 19, 2020","I ALREADY LOVE THIS SO MUCH! I'm almost scared to read this, because what if I finish it and the same thing happens? JK, thank you to the author!"
2,"Jul 20, 2021","""most people wouldn't understand why I'm making such a big fuss out of it"" oh trust me, I understand. finishing a novel after a week of full immersion usually leaves quite an empty space. 10 years of commitment?? oof"
2,"Jul 25, 2022","now with the rereading, its sad they didnt include or mention when he say ""I will live my own life"" (Dokja will live a reader/lonely child(also pronounced as dokja, which is the double meaning of his name) life), but SangAh misunderstood and thought he merely repeated his own name. it serves a nice meaning and somewhat hint about what kind of person he is."
2,"Jun 19, 2022",the panel where dokja said that the story was written for him and only him hits hard when you have read the novel
2,"Jun 18, 2022","“I was able to publish my story thanks to you.” everything makes sense after you read the novel, it hits so different "
2,"Jun 7, 2022","Wait...when Dokja was in his phone, there was a novel or webtoon or whatever that said ""The World After the Apocalypse."" Could this be a hint to the author also creating ""The World After Fall"" webtoon?"
2,"Aug 20, 2020",That reminds me that Duolingo keeps notifying me to do my lessons *sigh*^_*
2,"Aug 20, 2020",SHE USES DUOLINGO B E T

2,"Aug 19, 2020",“i have to live my own life” ???? did they rly have to butcher the translation like that😭😭
2,"Aug 19, 2020","I ALREADY LOVE THIS SO MUCH! I'm almost scared to read this, because what if I finish it and the same thing happens? JK, thank you to the author!"
2,"Jul 20, 2021","""most people wouldn't understand why I'm making such a big fuss out of it"" oh trust me, I understand. finishing a novel after a week of full immersion usually leaves quite an empty space. 10 years of commitment?? oof"
2,"Jul 25, 2022","now with the rereading, its sad they didnt include or mention when he say ""I will live my own life"" (Dokja will live a reader/lonely child(also pronounced as dokja, which is the double meaning of his name) life), but SangAh misunderstood and thought he merely repeated his own name. it serves a nice meaning and somewhat hint about what kind of person he is."
2,"Jun 19, 2022",the panel where dokja said that the story was written for him and only him hits hard when you have read the novel
2,"Jun 18, 2022","“I was able to publish my story thanks to you.” everything makes sense after you read the novel, it hits so different "
2,"Jun 7, 2022","Wait...when Dokja was in his phone, there was a novel or webtoon or whatever that said ""The World After the Apocalypse."" Could this be a hint to the author also creating ""The World After Fall"" webtoon?"
2,"Oct 17, 2021","whoever is reading this for the first time, get ready for a real legend"
2,"Oct 13, 2021",Dokja: WHY DO I HEAR BOSS MUSIC!??
2,"Sep 10, 2021","this series better go to 3,000 episodes"
2,"Sep 8, 2021","""Your free trial of living has ended"" Thats what I heard."
2,"Sep 1, 2021",daily life of a one piece fan 
2,"Aug 11, 2021","Reading the line ""It was a story written for me and only me."" REALLY HITS DIFFERENTLY WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NOVEL T_T T_T T_T"
2,"Jun 10, 2021",He really just said “your free trial of life has ended.”
2,"Jun 9, 2021",i may be late too the party but i cant wait to binge this webtoon all night
2,"Jun 8, 2021",it was at this moment that the train knew.....he fcked up
2,"Jun 6, 2021","I love the novel for this story, really happy it’s got a manwa now"
2,"May 28, 2021","When you know who tls123 is, that last episode hits different 😢😖"
2,"May 26, 2021","As a person who finished the web novel, Dokja’s flustered look when talking to Sangah is really funny to me... "
2,"May 15, 2021",This webtoon better have at least 3149 chapters... I'm just saying. =D
2,"May 1, 2021","I'm rereading this because of the coin raid event, and I realized something... How different is the grading system in Korea? When I think of the 8th grade, I think of 12-13 year olds, but Dokja is 28, so if he's been reading it for 10 years, that means he started when he was 18... Right? "
2,"May 1, 2021",“The most popular girl at work” we still have that through adulthood? quq
2,"Apr 29, 2021","so it was like, the author won the contest of which apocalypse story would be selected to be implemented in the real world"
2,"Apr 29, 2021",when you cancel your subscription but already bought a lifetime warranty
2,"Apr 29, 2021",it was at that moment he new he f#cked up 🤣🤣🤣
2,"Apr 28, 2021","It would be a real twist if Dokja was the reason the ""apocalypse"" happened. Since he helped the story become ""paid content."""
2,"Apr 28, 2021","guys can I ask ,who's here for coins?????"
2,"Apr 27, 2021",i just realized something... in TLS123 (the author’s name) the tls stands for the last survivor
2,"Apr 27, 2021","the monster has a big round head, with white fur and horns....is it Appa?"
2,"Apr 26, 2021","Woah, I'm honestly in love. webtoon recommended me this to get 5 coins, and now I don't think I'm gonna stop reading"

2,"Aug 29, 2020",Your free trial of living has ended
2,"Aug 28, 2020","The part when he said “I read it when I was bullied at school” hits pretty hard. If you ever been bullied, I think you’d understand "

2,"Aug 28, 2020","this is literally ""Your free trial of life has expired"""

2,"Aug 26, 2020","Is it just me or the art resemble Solo leveling, not to compare or anything but the art is just amazing and the only series with that beautiful art, that I can think up is Solo leveling."
2,"Aug 25, 2020","Started reading this for the contest, but now I might stick with it"
2,"Aug 25, 2020",Literally what just happened is “Your Free Trial of Living has ended”
2,"Aug 25, 2020","Gaahhhh, his meaning of what TWSA meant for him, and his 10yr long dedication to see it through the end, is like what Noblesse meant for me... my first manhwa. Over a 10yr course for completion, seeing it come to an end was beautifully sad, and I don't regret it one bit. I have a feeling this one will be great as well~"
2,"Aug 25, 2020","Okay, just a thought here. What if the writer is him in the future somehow...?? Maybe, I dont know but what if ahah."
2,"Aug 25, 2020",came here for the coins stayed for the story

2,"Aug 24, 2020","""if you're reading this you will survive"" but as he's the only one reading, will he be the only survivor??"
2,"Aug 24, 2020","If you read Solo Leveling and wonder why is it so similarly drawn, it's because it's from the same studio and apparently drawn by the same hand 😉 Don't forget to like the episode if you enjoyed it! "
2,"Aug 24, 2020",Is anyone else re-reading this to get coins 😂
2,"Aug 24, 2020",from now on I have to start reading underrated webtoon  only God knows if there is a real webtoon like that
2,"Aug 24, 2020",This is getting infesting af tbh I would’ve found this way later probably 50 episodes but I’m not complaining I get free coins by reading this intresting story all I hope if that it doesn’t become drawn out like Dice does
2,"Aug 24, 2020",please tell me this will actual be 3149 episodes let it be true
2,"Aug 22, 2020",from the same studios that brought you solo leveling brings you the omniscient readers viewpoint!!!! 🥳🥳

2,"Aug 21, 2020",just dont tell me there gonna be 3000 ep
2,"Aug 21, 2020","What a fascinating first chapter. This Earth is now paid content? What does that mean? Ah, I love this. I think it has a lot of potential"
2,"Aug 20, 2020","I'm afraid to finish this webtoon, who knows that might happen to me in the subway"
2,"Aug 20, 2020","they really did say ""your free trial of life has ended"" didn't they"
2,"Aug 20, 2020","I kinda relate to the protag. Fiction is always much more interesting than actual life, and I often find myself daydreaming while reading or watching fiction, placing myself into some overpowered side-character role. Hoping to enjoy this the whole way through. "
2,"Aug 20, 2020",Sanga is actually not annoying and I’m excited for the rest of the story. 
2,"Aug 20, 2020",Lmao the world quite literally just said “your free subscription to life is now over”
2,"Aug 20, 2020","Ugh, I hate people who interrupts me while reading webtoons like this 😤"
2,"Aug 20, 2020",this the part where we see 10 or so health bars fill up and the music gets all somber with opera vocals everywhere. Webtoon MC reads about a Webtoon MC surviving the apocalypse must now survive the apocalypse. Player 1 Press Start
2,"Aug 19, 2020","Train: Stops.                          Passengers: ""Why do I hear boss music?"""
2,"Aug 19, 2020",Anybody else catch some “I know that feel” vibes when he was talking about TWSA coming to an end after so many years? I felt that after Naruto and Bleach ended and I know I’ll feel it after One Piece ends in 200 years. Lol
2,"Aug 19, 2020",Can we have solo leveling here too next? :D
2,"Aug 19, 2020","""I read web novels while she studies Spanish."" That hit me"
2,"Aug 19, 2020","Everyone else: ""I'm the protagonist"" Dokja: ""I'm a reader-"""
2,"Aug 19, 2020","Kyah, this is it. Huhuhu. Just looking forward for the partnership of Dokja and...🤭 I feel like I'm a certain constellation now, ehem. Excited to see the action scenes drawn as well, yeahhhhhhh.... 💪"
2,"Aug 19, 2020",I like how my man was still looking at his phone for his present 
2,"Aug 19, 2020",dokja has to live a dokja life 
2,"Dec 23, 2020",I bet the apps Duolingo
2,"Sep 29, 2022",Ooooo this is very cleaver! I like how the author uses words that have multiple meanings. And I love the way the themes were woven together. I wish I understood Korean so I could read it in its original script!
2,"Sep 29, 2022",ooooh this is so exciting!!! 
2,"Sep 17, 2022",I’m at the edge of my seat right now ddhehehe this is so interesting and the plot seems very promising
2,"Aug 17, 2022",I'm excited but I hope is not 3000+ chapters like Dokja's novel.😅
2,"Aug 4, 2022","I decided to reread it, it’s an amazing story! Though I wonder, since the author said that it was thanks to Dokja that they were able to complete it and it became paid-content….if he had stopped reading at some point would the apocalypse not have started?"
2,"Jun 21, 2022",THIS IS SO GOOD… I’m in AWE
2,"Jun 16, 2022",This is an amazing webtoon! I love all of it so far! please keep this going 🙏 ❤❤❤
2,"Jun 9, 2022",Reading this again after a year Really excited I am after reading Trash of count's family I remembered about this Manhwa and I have a feeling Dokja is gonna be one of my fav protagonist of course 1st being Cale 
2,"Jun 8, 2022",I just noticed that the novel above twsa is a reference to the authors other novel “the world after the fall” very cool
2,"May 17, 2022",I AM OFFICIALLY RE-READING WITH ANOTHER ACC 😭😭😭😭
2,"May 16, 2022","ahahaha, the world after the fall. i really came back just to check if that was really there lol"
2,"May 13, 2022",Well he got what he wanted he is now the main protagonist I really like the parallel they are making. 
2,"May 2, 2022","""It was a story written for me and only me"" Youre right dokja youre right"
2,"Apr 28, 2022",dude my friend force-fed me details about this webtoon so i had to read it and now i'm not so bugged about it. this is actually really nice <3
2,"Apr 23, 2022",it's cool that the episode is long and entertaining. 
2,"Apr 21, 2022",Now I’m afraid the webtoon will be 3149 episodes and I have to read it to survive.
2,"Apr 19, 2022","""is it a terrorist attack"""
2,"Apr 12, 2022",funfact he was in 8th grade when he started to read is story and so am I... i-is he my future

Idk anymore, anywayyy Since then I stopped reading and was waiting for chapter and now I decided to rereading it again and daaaaaamn I am just hyped for this story "

2,"Jan 1, 2022",tls / the last survivor ???
2,"Dec 31, 2021","I don't like that they removed honorifics in this translation. They can be confusing for some people, but they express how characters feel about each other. Also, it is pretty annoying to read without them when you get used to them."

Just first names being used and I'm assuming right now all honorifics being removed. *sigh* Another instance of eastern naming conventions being erased for the sake of westerners.

2,"Apr 28, 2021",It's kinda weird looking back at a Dokja before everything. He seems so much less mature and more simple minded. 
2,"Apr 28, 2021","mans shouldn't be single, he's totally my type. a guy who reads web novels 🤧👌"
2,"Apr 28, 2021","Because I was on the bus on my way home from work reading this webtoon, when the most beautiful girl appeared and talked to him, I was also expecting some handsome man to talked to me too... but when I lift my head up there was only an old granny on the seat in front of mine... "
2,"Apr 28, 2021",The world was like your free trial of peaceful life has expired and the next few years have been paid for with no chance of a refund. 
2,"Apr 27, 2021",not me re-reading OVP for coins 😭
2,"Apr 27, 2021",rereading this since i ready finished the novel WAYYY back and wow it hurts so much to see them again LOL
2,"Apr 27, 2021","I am rereading it while waiting for the next chapter... And I can tell you, this webtoon won't ever, EVER, let you down 🥖"
2,"Apr 27, 2021","This is such a creative and interesting story idea. Keep it up author, you're the best! ❤️👌🏻"
2,"Apr 26, 2021","I guess I need to read more romance webtoon,  just incase I get placed into one 🙂🙃"
2,"Apr 26, 2021",after this chapter I'm gonna study instead of binging webtoon episodes because my life won't become a fantasy from nonfiction.
2,"Apr 26, 2021","who wouldn't read a novel with that many chapters?? I mean, at least I wouldn't have to worry for a while if there is continuation or a movie coming... "
2,"Apr 26, 2021","""i get why all the guys are head over heels for her. but none of that concerns me"" you only have eyes for a certain someone, we get it"
2,"Apr 26, 2021",god rereading after you finished the story really just hits different
2,"Apr 26, 2021",They legit just went your free subscription to life has just ended
2,"Apr 26, 2021","thank you,coin contest,for letting me find this comic I am now I love with "
2,"Apr 26, 2021","Dokja really called me out, we're one and the same"
2,"Apr 26, 2021",People got mad at him for a RECOMMENDATION poor guy
2,"Apr 26, 2021",Omg it has the best graphics i've ever seen
2,"Apr 25, 2021",It’s paid content bro😂
2,"Apr 24, 2021","""Your free trial of existence has expired""""please pay your life to extend the warranty"""
2,"Apr 22, 2021","sooo.... the novel told Dokja that because he read it he WILL survive. It said ""one thing is certain. If you're reading this, you will survive"" We dont know why yet, but the writer seems fairly certain of his survival "
2,"Apr 7, 2021","For those wondering if you should read this, YOU SHOULD! This WEBTOON has a really unique plot, the MC isn't OP for no reason, he uses his brain and knowledge well but still encounters challenges. The world is also very well built, and people behave realistically. The pacing is also really great, it never spends too long on one thing but it still gives a detailed explanation. Overall it's a unique story with a good world and likeable characters."
2,"Mar 19, 2021","I'm hooked already, the art style is sooooo good!"
2,"Mar 15, 2021",I don't know why he'd be ashamed of reading web novels...
2,"Mar 13, 2021",your living licenses just expired
2,"Mar 12, 2021",SROP TJATS KINDA FUNNY THE FREE TRIAL FOR THEIR WORLD IS UP???

2,"Mar 1, 2021",who tf is that author?
2,"Feb 28, 2021","omg this looks fantastic, the art the concept! im in love. cant wait to see where this goes! 🤯"
2,"Feb 25, 2021",Wait i forgot that i wasnt the dude in story cuz i tought to my self why isnt anyone reading this webtoon
2,"Feb 25, 2021",THEORY TIME: TLS123 stands for “The Last Survivor”
2,"Feb 19, 2021",remember to comment and like every episode so that the artist will help you survive the apocalypse. Thank you for this episode! I look forward to finishing the series.
2,"Feb 15, 2021","No shit I’m loving this rn. I can’t believe I abandoned this story months ago at the prologue and only picked it back up again now, THIS IS SUCH A MASTERPIECE!"
2,"Feb 12, 2021",Omg I wish this was an anime already😭😭A weeb’s dream life 
2,"Feb 12, 2021","if dokja reading the story make it the winner of a contest, then would that contest be something like writing a really long story then if theres someone still reading to the last episode it'll become reality ? that'll make the author a villain. but optimistically, there might be a creature that's about to destroy the world but author and somepeople managed to negotiate so they can come up with better things than what's supposed to happen ? idk."
2,"Feb 4, 2021","Now, that's what I'm talking about. 😂😂😂"
2,"Feb 2, 2021",I felt like I just read 4 episodes in 1
2,"Jan 29, 2021",When your free trial for life expires.
2,"Jan 27, 2021","BTW apparently one of the other stories kdj was reading, ""The World After The Apocalypse"" or ""The World After The Fall"" is another webnovel written by the author of the novel Omniscient Reader is based on"
2,"Jan 22, 2021","I like how Dokja just considered almost a nerd/weird by most but he looks average/cute here and I bet if there was a drama/live action movie, Dokja would be acted by a handsome/pretty guy 😂 In other words, he would've at least gotten 1 love confession in his life.."
2,"Jan 19, 2021",when the monster has straighter teeth than u
2,"Jan 18, 2021","Oh........... I'm still wondering, how did the same person get to be the 3 'top comments'??!!"
2,"Jan 15, 2021","imagine the plot of this webtoon is real, and what's going to happen in this will happen in real life"
2,"Jan 6, 2021",I never study i just read novels mate!
2,"Jan 6, 2021",the monster has a greater teeth than me 😬
2,"Jan 3, 2021",the art and story of this webtoon is so epic! i’m so glad I found this!
2,"Dec 31, 2020",why did i get chills 
2,"Dec 31, 2020",hey we read webtoons that means we will be unsuccessful . what does that mean 
2,"Dec 29, 2020",Sooo he was 18yrs old at 8th grade??
2,"Dec 7, 2020","Is it me, or does the art look like Solo Leveling? Or are they the same artist... im so confused but the story line and art is amazing so far! Keep it up! 😊👌"
2,"Dec 5, 2020",idk why I keep thinking man maybe if you didnt read it to the end the author would never finish and the world would be fine 🤣
2,"Nov 13, 2020",If this is going to be 3146 episodes. I'll keep reading it just to be safe 
2,"Nov 11, 2020","Rereading this, I just realized something. Can it be that the contest is which story will be selected by the Dokkaebi to make it happen irl? And by paid, I guess part of the profits of it will be given to tls123?? So tls123 is alive?? I wonder if we get to see him."
2,"Nov 4, 2020",i wanna read TWSA too 😔🤲🏼let's go dokjaaa 🤩🤩
2,"Nov 1, 2020",Sucks when your entire life’s genre is non-fiction
2,"Oct 28, 2020",End of 2020 gonna be like
2,"Oct 25, 2020","Wait!? Is this not the joke of ""Your free trial oy life has ended"""
2,"Oct 17, 2020",THE CREATIVITY!!!! I CANT!!! ARGHAAAAAAAA!!!! *flips tables and breathes deeply with a crazed look in my eye* SO GOOD!
2,"Oct 16, 2020",I had so much fun reading it....thank you author🙂
2,"Oct 16, 2020","It was at that moment he knew, the world fcked up JK"
2,"Oct 15, 2020",When it's only episode 1 but it's already EPIC. 
2,"Oct 15, 2020","So apparently the author of the story won a contest which they thanked Dokja for since bc of him the author was able to win. He gave Dokja a prize as a thank you gift for helping them win, which in the email the author said ""Starting at 7 pm today, TWSA will become paid content. This will help you. I wish you all the best."" I feel like the author made Dokja the hero of the story as the gift."
2,"Oct 12, 2020",so the main character is basically half the people on webtoon rn.
2,"Oct 9, 2020",If this were a show I would binge that shit like I binge Attack on Titan omagod 
2,"Oct 8, 2020",lowkey looks like early song jin-woo
2,"Oct 8, 2020",Actually becoming paid content makes a lot of sense. After all how much would you pay for a manga that can tell the future?
2,"Oct 8, 2020","I get the feeling that whatever is to come is only happening because he read every episode of that story. Maybe some aliens or demons or something had a bet like “If at least one human reads the entire story, we get to invade earth” or something lol"
2,"Sep 30, 2020","“If my life was any other genre than non-fiction, I’d probably be a protagonist.” If that ain’t the truth for all readers😭"
2,"Sep 26, 2020",I would so read twsa every last episode 
2,"Sep 25, 2020",solo leveling vibes
2,"Sep 24, 2020",My boy Dokja still looking at the time for that paid content. Such devotion.
2,"Sep 22, 2020",it looks like it's made by the same people who made solo leveling I'm already into it
2,"Sep 21, 2020",The universe really just said “your free trial of living is over”
2,"Sep 15, 2020","""Your free trial of living has expired"""
2,"Sep 15, 2020",i wonder if this webtoon also have a 3000+ episodes
2,"Sep 6, 2020",I'M GONNA SURVIVE 2020 
2,"Sep 5, 2020",holdup this dude just described what I may be in years to come
2,"Sep 3, 2020","Tls123's mind. ""Know hat would be a good idea SAO in reality!"" ... Reader ""... I'm f**ked"""
2,"Sep 3, 2020",My man is the LITERAL embodiment of “I’m the protagonist in my own world”
2,"Sep 3, 2020",Oh no... their seven day free trial has ended...
2,"Sep 3, 2020",im excited asf
2,"Aug 31, 2020",kinda wish the genre of my life would change too... (kinda) 
2,"Aug 31, 2020",Your free trial of living has expired 
2,"Aug 30, 2020",Thats crazy I know we make memes of 2020 being the year Earths free trial has expired but this is actually what happened rn
2,"Aug 30, 2020","similar to our MC, Webtoon has been my safe haven throughout my life for the past 5 years, I'm extremely grateful, the stories have kept me alive. :)"
2,"Aug 29, 2020","me laughing because i already know that its about to go down because he finished reading the series and unleashed the ""apocalypse"" on the world: HHAHAHAHAHHAHA commeners."
2,"Aug 29, 2020","""¿Me puedes prestar dinero?"" I legit thought for a sec that I was reading the history translated in Spanish and I was like 'Finally something on my first language' lol"
2,"Aug 29, 2020","wait, it took him ten years to read 3139 ep. I read like 300 EPs a day when I try 😅"
2,"Aug 28, 2020","this is my story bro. I published a creation in an app but I'm the one who views it. But one day, a miracle happened and I got a viewer....duh...
Aaannndddd!!! I love this webtoon!!! You had to go through intense bad lucks😢 "
2,"Aug 28, 2020",I really hope the mc isin't a naive goody two shoes degenerate. Please be a badass antihero. I BEG YOU
2,"Aug 27, 2020",10 years for 3k chapters? i could do that in 10 weeks heck maybe even 10 days
2,"Aug 27, 2020",I was like is this a hint that the webtoon is going full paid subscription thing 🤡🤡 NooOOoOoo
2,"Aug 27, 2020",I can relate myself with the main but unlike his life my genre wont change 
2,"Aug 27, 2020",2020 
2,"Aug 26, 2020","Okokok I’m guessing the reason why the story is becoming paid content because everyone will be scrambling for answers. The phrase “this will be helpful to you” probably means that since Dokja read all the chap, he’ll understand everything while everyone else has to pay for answers. "
2,"Aug 26, 2020",i came here for free coins but this webtoon amazed me
2,"Aug 26, 2020",so... 2020 happened?
2,"Aug 26, 2020","""I've been lonely and single all my life."" Me: …but he's so cute?!"
2,"Aug 26, 2020","Bro I keep saying, if there ever is really an apocalypse, the ppl who read manga and webcomics like these are gonna be the saviors.🙃"
2,"Aug 25, 2020",I AM HOOKED!!! I AM INSTANTLY HOOKED!! 
2,"Aug 25, 2020",screw the COINS this stuffs good
2,"Aug 25, 2020","Not gonna lie, came for free coins and got invested in the story instead"
2,"Aug 25, 2020",me a hispanic reading the spanish part without realising it was spanish at first 👁️👄👁️
2,"Aug 25, 2020",I just came to get coins but now I'm in love I don't want to stop reading 
2,"Aug 25, 2020",Think someone ran that comic for 2020...
2,"Aug 25, 2020",Okay don’t judge me...but imagine if after I finish reading this the same thing happens to me...
2,"Aug 25, 2020","Omg I came here for the free coins but will absolutely be staying for the story. It's so cool so far, I'll be looking forward for it. "
2,"Aug 25, 2020",It seems like the trial period of your life has ended. Please die now!

2,"Aug 24, 2020",DAMN. it's going to be a very interesting ride.
2,"Aug 24, 2020",And that's why you should read web novels.
2,"Aug 24, 2020",Is this what will happen at the end of 2020?
2,"Aug 24, 2020",Anybody else getting solo leveling vibes from this? Not even sure if people around here know about Solo leveling but the art is pretty similar...
2,"Aug 24, 2020","My theory is that dokja is actually just a made up character in the author’s world. And so, he was thanking dokja because he was the one who inspired him to write that novel. "
2,"Aug 24, 2020",why do i hear boss music
2,"Aug 24, 2020",earths free trial of life has ended 
2,"Aug 24, 2020",think i might have an additional character to my husband collection 
2,"Aug 23, 2020","Lol, this is essentially 2020. Your tutorial has ended. Prepare for the real game."
2,"Aug 23, 2020",Dude was really living on free trial mode
2,"Aug 23, 2020",I like Dokja already 😂. I feel like all ya web comic readers will relate lol

2,"Aug 22, 2020","""If you read this, you'll survive the apocalypse."" Well, I do wanna survive 2020. 🤔"
2,"Aug 22, 2020",I read the novel of this Masterpi~ Manhwa its safe to say that this is way better than Solo Leveling. Just imagine Lelouch Vi Brittania and Light Yagami in one person
2,"Aug 22, 2020",OK.IM HOOKED
2,"Aug 21, 2020","Kim Dokja is sooooo cute. So in love with his design, I can't 😭👌 I just can't wait for more arcs to be drawn soon ❤️"
2,"Aug 21, 2020",So maybe after this novel comes to a end we will face the same situation 
2,"Aug 21, 2020",I wonder how long will it take for this title to have an anime adoptation?I'm gonna show y'll a picture of my ass when that time comes.
2,"Aug 20, 2020",Dude please have a patreon really wanna donate this is awesome

2,"Aug 20, 2020",I’m reading this bc I’m convinced this is what’s going to happen at the end of 2020
2,"Aug 20, 2020","here before this gets 99,999+ likes well time for a new webtoon to be top 5"
2,"Aug 20, 2020","My mind is BLOWN. This concept, its so cool! I think his backstory was to build empathy with the readers, since most of us are in a similar situation. I have to finish this webtoon.  1 Subscriber!"
2,"Aug 20, 2020",Your free trial of life has expired 
2,"Aug 20, 2020",lmao the only thing i can think right now is just ‘your free trial of living has exprired.’
2,"Aug 20, 2020",THANK YOU WEBTOON FOR FEATURING THIS AMAZING STORY AND THANK YOU AUTHOR !!!
2,"Aug 20, 2020",2020 in a nutshell
2,"Aug 19, 2020",this was more amazing than I thought..I really like reading isekai genre..but this is..well not that genre(isekai) but it's so AMAZING!!!! it sooo CRAZY. prologue caught my attention so I read turns out it's good!!
2,"Aug 19, 2020",The free trial of your planet has ended. Please purchase the paid version of Earth or return to the void.
2,"Aug 19, 2020","I just started to read this and the plot and storyline so far is wonderful, but I just can't get over the fact that he looks just like the main character from (Solo) from the face to the blue shirt to the black pants, but hopefully, I can get over it because right now it looks like a rip off....not a cheap one though"
2,"Aug 19, 2020",So can we expect when this series ends the world will end too? 🤔
2,"Aug 19, 2020",I'm also a reader. a webtoon reader.
2,"Aug 19, 2020",probably took the guy years cause he probably fuckıng had to use daily pass LUL
2,"Aug 19, 2020",I got it. HE wrote the WEBTOON. This is his Future Diary.
2,"Aug 19, 2020","just saying some parents name what they want their children to be like (kpop member) bambam's brother is named ""Bank"" because they wanted him to he wealthy lol so I think this mc has a normal name 🤓"
2,"Aug 19, 2020",why does this look like the same style as solo leveling
2,"Aug 19, 2020","So, if I got it right. If he didn't read the novel til the end and the novel didn't win that prize, the 'scenario' wouldn't have happened in the first place? "
2,"Aug 19, 2020",Am I the only one who thinks the arts look like Solo Leveling ?
2,"Aug 19, 2020",Tbh I want this comic to last 10 years now!
2,"Aug 19, 2020","Thank you for popping up with that ad Webtoons! I'm one satisfied ad clicker. *continues to read this with giant eyes. 👁👁 ""bring on the chaos!"""
2,"Aug 19, 2020","woah woah woah, so... Earth... up until like, whatever is present day in this webtoon, let's say today, was all a ""Free Trial Period""?! and the real thing, the ""paid content"" is the destruction of it?!!!??!? "
2,"Jul 20, 2021",is this webtoon gonna be over 3000 chapters
2,3 days ago,he basically ended the word by finishing the novel? or I'm I wrong?
2,5 days ago,How come I’m just finding about this webtoon now? I’ve had webtoon since 2020! Can’t wait to binge read this! Thank you author 💕
2,"Oct 5, 2022","this serie is soo coolll, i read it for the 3 time"
2,"Oct 5, 2022",This is genuinely the coolest beginning for a webtoon I've read. I just came back to reminisce haha
2,"Sep 30, 2022",The art is so stunning and the scripts so well written that the story flows smoothly.
2,"Sep 29, 2022",The art is stunning and the story is interesting. I’m hooked already.

2,"Aug 28, 2022",I will start to read this! hahahah who knows what will happen in the future 
2,"Aug 15, 2022",the way dokja pulled his phone away when she looked at it is totally relatable. I do it all the time and people think I'm doing something wrong. it's a force of habit
2,"Aug 7, 2022",rereading this again after rereading the novel last 2 weeks
2,"Jul 29, 2022","So THAT'S what the author meant by ""paid content"" (""The free service of the 8612th planetary system has come to an end."") Meaning- the webnovel IS the 8612th planetary system?"
2,"Jul 27, 2022","omll y am I so late,THIS IS SO GUD "
2,"Jul 27, 2022",This webtoon already has me hooked! I’m glad to be the 5000th comment also
2,"Jul 27, 2022",We came to contact you about your planets extended warranty.
2,"Jul 20, 2022",GUYSSSS I HAVE A THEORY!! SO YOU GUYS KNOW THE CONSTELLATION NAMED SECRETIVE PLOTTER RIGHT? WHAT IF THAT IS ACTUALLY THE AUTHORRR SINCE HE WASNT IN THE NOVEL AND MC DOESNT SEEM RO KNOW ABOUT IT!!!!!
2,"Jul 18, 2022","I'm rereading this for the at least 5th time and honestly I never got to say this, but I'm really thankful for whoever the artist is, for not showing me my Dokja with a buzzcut. I've even lost interest in my hallway crush when he got a buzzcut cause personally I can't stand it, I cannot imagine how I would've reacted if I saw my poor husband with a haircut I dislike... Thus, I send my entire heart to the artist."
2,"Jul 18, 2022",Why is Nobody talking about how he said that he been reading it for ten years and he started reading it in grade 8 and he's 28 years old. That would he would've had to be 18 in grade 8...
2,"Jul 11, 2022",have....I finally found a web comic that actually has long chapters and each week is worth the wait?!?
2,"Jul 7, 2022","to new readers, i hope you enjoy reading~^^"
2,"Jul 6, 2022",Goosebumps 😬🥶! The same feeling when i first read solo leveling. New Fav🥰
2,"Jul 6, 2022",The author of TWSA is the cause of this. So what and who is he? I'm loving this already.

2,"Jun 29, 2022",Re-reading what about y'all?
2,"Jun 28, 2022",99% sure the one who wrote the webnovel is the MC’s future self
2,"Jun 27, 2022",Who else is here rereading the entire thing every time a new chapter comes out just to make sure
2,"Jun 23, 2022",well now im reading this over and over until 10 years I've been reading for a month now
2,"Jun 20, 2022",imagine if the web novel is actually out there and if you get to the ending this would happen
2,"Jun 19, 2022",Man really said your free trial of living has ended
2,"Jun 19, 2022","I know I’m late to read this but I feel like I’m gonna finish this today or tomorrow it’s is really interesting already, as a book fanatic that likes any genes this has to be one of the most interesting start of a story I have seen so far, I am really gonna enjoy this story.

2,"May 19, 2022","The fact there are so many foreshadowing in this episode. Gosh rereading while waiting for updates. This is my second action shounen manwha with one if the most unique plot and the art just gets better in every chapter. Also waiting for ""The world after the fall"" the author is very creative."
2,"May 14, 2022","I remember reading this when my social media friends keep on posting some of ORV pics and etc. So because of my curiosity i read it, but dude, I'm currently rereading it while waiting for the episodes to be many but, thinking about the spoilers that KDJ have been coma at the earlier end of the story in the novel makes me hesitate to finish it. my hearts not ready to be broken and my tissues not yet prepared T.T  "
2,"May 13, 2022","am i the only one who is curious who the novel author is like i would read a 3K chapter novel or manga its a dream come true

2,"Apr 8, 2022",I'm on a bus reading this 😳😦
2,"Mar 25, 2022","Omg 😂 I just realized the original Omniscient Reader authors, SingShong, had a cameo here. The novel Dokja switched to to hide from Sangah, “The World After the Apocalypse,” was the previously released work of the Omniscient Reader authors. 😂"
2,"Mar 16, 2022",Thank you for all your hard work and effort. - Mass Production Maker
2,"Mar 16, 2022","plot twist: the ml is actually the author of the book. Like some kind of time distortion stuffs or counterpart bhahaha. Don't be alarmed, am just guessing"

2,"Oct 13, 2021",Wow... I'm happy i found this story.. Very interesting content .. Reading here from 🇵🇭
2,"Oct 13, 2021",lets goo
2,"Oct 11, 2021",such a nice change of pace to read a webtoon about adults instead of over sexualized and old looking high schoolers. I'm 25 damnit.
2,"Oct 8, 2021",I finally have the time to read this and AAAAAA IM GETTING CHILLS !!!
2,"Oct 4, 2021",okay so like if he is 28 rn and started to read the novel 10 ys ago then he would have been 18 right so why is it saying that he started the novel in 8th grade. I might just be confused or something😭😭😭
2,"Sep 29, 2021",Ahhh i want to change my genre too 😭
2,"Sep 28, 2021",psshh 3100 in 10 years? i could do that in a few months
2,"Sep 27, 2021",Alright I’m already loving this
2,"Sep 24, 2021",I read this out loud to myself and it feels so real!! First episode and I'm already so hyped!!! 🥳😲
2,"Sep 23, 2021","SO IS THE AUTHOR SOME KIND OF GOD??? I FEEL LIKE THAT CONTEST WAS TO DETERMINE WHAT ""INTERESTING"" THING WOULD BE INFLICTED UPON EARTH"

2,"Aug 28, 2021",I want y life to change genres 😭 ✋🏻 
2,"Aug 28, 2021",Why do i relate to his inner monologue (while on the bus talking to Sangah) sm? Honestly this story helps me feel like i can be important too
2,"Aug 27, 2021",theory the novel was made by future him or by someone else from the future to prepare them for the apocalypse and save humanity 
2,"Aug 26, 2021",i relate to the mc a lil too much…..
2,"Aug 19, 2021","This is so cool! And the art is freaking gorgeous!!I’m a little confused on the timeline, though… if he’s 28, and he’s been reading for ten years, wouldn’t he have started when he turned 18, not when he was in eighth grade?"
2,"Aug 9, 2021",love at first sight
2,"Aug 7, 2021","respect. and oh the nostalgia. I know what he means. reading epics and huge novels. for those gems that rises above others that you read for 1000 of Chapters.  I have 5 proper ended series in the 2000 range. hopefully this webtoon will live up to some of it. your facing tall competition. legendary moonlight sculptor, reverend insanity, the king's avatar, death scriptures, the legendary  mechanic. etc. Game start. fight properly and show me a world that I've never seen. shake my belief!"
2,"Aug 6, 2021",This is such a cool concept!!
2,"Aug 5, 2021",wait...so can i expect that  we are also living in a free trial??? 🙃
2,"Jul 28, 2021",omg
2,"Jul 28, 2021",AJSBSKEHJEEHWK SO COOL IT ALMOST LIKE SWEET HOME 🤩 THEY BOTH HAVE A COOL LIFE BCUZ OF BEING KIND

2,"Jul 21, 2021",Ahh kwaii
2,"Jul 20, 2021",So this is literally the “ free trial of life has ended” meme.
2,"Jul 18, 2021","Just finished the novel, now I'm reading the webtoon again. So crazy now that I know what's going on"
2,"Jul 16, 2021","When he was like, "" She would be the main character"" And I was sittin there like, "" Bitch,""*looks at thumbnail*,"" Try again-"""
2,"Jul 13, 2021",does anyone actually know that omniscient reader is on Webnovel?
2,"Jul 11, 2021","I also thought almost the same as the principal character, Like 2 months ago I got to the conclusion that my only purpose in life was to be the “observer” seeing other people get ahead of me and just witness how greatest they are and not really live my life."
2,"Jul 5, 2021",not me try to find a novel over 3000+ chapter after this
2,"Jul 5, 2021","imagine if you finish this,and the last page says the same thing"
2,"Jul 2, 2021",your free trial of living has expired
2,"Jun 27, 2021",don't worry ur already the main character
2,"Jun 24, 2021",That goosebumps thoo omiiiiiiii lezz go!!
2,"Jun 23, 2021",Du du du du
2,"Jun 23, 2021","the only think i don't like is how they got rid of the honorifics, after coming from the Web novel, it's pretty jarring to read, lol"
2,"Jun 20, 2021","*frantically looks for webtoons 3,00+ episodes*"
2,"Jun 20, 2021","NO FUCKING WAY i didn't realize kdj was reading shingshong's other webnovel ""The World After The Fall""/The World After The Apocalypse (in this translation) the details✨"
2,"Jun 12, 2021",so basically their free 1000+ year trial for living has ended
2,"Jun 3, 2021",i'll read this just in case the world's about to end too 🚶
2,"Jun 1, 2021",This be telling us to always finish what you read.
2,"Jun 1, 2021",i love this
2,"May 27, 2021",the art is incredibly beautiful with each panel leaving me with a deep appreciation for webtoon artists
2,"May 26, 2021",It’s been a long time since i get goosebumps reading ❤️
2,"May 25, 2021",dokja be breaking the 4th wall 😆
2,"May 19, 2021","i dont understand how 10 years of reading the novel was quite accurate to think that if he read it during his 8th grade, then would it be published around more than 10 years already after the last episode was released when he is 28 years old?? "
2,"May 18, 2021",So is this webtoon gonna be 3000 episodes long :D?
2,"May 16, 2021",Im reading this the second time!!its an amazing story you wont be disappointed!im sooo hyped eee
2,"May 15, 2021",I feel like this will become my favourite series...
2,"May 15, 2021",Sir...you literally are the protagonist tho-
2,"May 13, 2021",i get the feeling that this is going to be epic

2,"Apr 30, 2021",WTF how is he single? He IS hot and handsome😳😳 I'm rereading this RN and I'm realising it. 
2,"Apr 30, 2021","re reading for the 2nd time, epic so far again!"
2,"Apr 30, 2021",I'm re-reading this and it's amazing to go back and see what Dokja was like at the start! 
2,"Apr 29, 2021",the author won a plot contest in the heaven and now it is their reality lmao
2,"Apr 29, 2021",I read dokya as doja cat💀
2,"Apr 29, 2021",Sangah and Dokja's relationship 😭😭 I didn't realize how much it changed. I didn't realize how DOKJA CHANGED
2,"Apr 29, 2021",this got me hookep up on the first episode. 😍
2,"Apr 29, 2021",now that i think about it if this for me came in real life it would be the horror genre 
2,"Apr 28, 2021",I participated in this contest and I'm glad I picked this
2,"Apr 28, 2021",“The genre of my life changed” that is such a good line!
2,"Apr 28, 2021",“it’s a great series if you can bear through it. people can be so cruel” LMAOO ME W/ ONE PIECE 
2,"Apr 28, 2021",reminds me a tiny bit of solo leveling
2,"Apr 28, 2021","this would be such a good anime, I hope it one day becomes one!❤️"
2,"Apr 28, 2021",woow! who came up with this plot?!seriously what genius brain cells you must be having!!!
2,"Apr 28, 2021",Anyone else rereading for the event thing 
2,"Apr 27, 2021",So basically.... their free trial of living has ended
2,"Apr 27, 2021",Imagine being a loyal reader for 10years 😭 I cannot relate. 
2,"Apr 27, 2021",One piece be like:
2,"Apr 27, 2021",Lol did the author of TWSA sell them out to the planetary gods?
2,"Apr 27, 2021",I was listening to Renai Circulation while reading this and it completely ruined the mood
2,"Apr 27, 2021",When you say paid content 🤔Do they pay with Life's 💀?? 
2,"Apr 27, 2021",I found my own new favourite webtoon 😋
2,"Apr 27, 2021",3000 episodes in ten years?? Pfffttt I would've ended them in a month 🤣
2,"Apr 27, 2021","also, can I say that it's obvious that Sang Ah likes Dokja? Talking to him first, sitting down RIGHT beside him, asking him a dozen questions despite his lack of response, trying to help him when she realizes he's being let go, clinging to his arm when shes scared. THE GIRL LIKES HIM."
2,"Apr 27, 2021",Ominous. But it’s too late to turn back
2,"Apr 27, 2021","Bruh this Manhwa got my attention now, this is going to be lit 😆😆😆. This whole time i was reading i had goosebumps all over my body."
2,"Apr 26, 2021",New readers are gonna Love this
2,"Apr 26, 2021",who else started singing du du du by blackpink when it said du du du😅✋🏽
2,"Apr 26, 2021",this is excitinggg
2,"Apr 26, 2021",ik everyone's talking about how interesting the series is...I'm sorry but i ship Dokja × Sangah
2,"Apr 26, 2021",Iam here for coins don’t mind me 😜
2,"Apr 26, 2021","i've been re-reading this for so many times, and i still get the chills, man."
2,"Apr 26, 2021",so is it supposed to mean that the monsters(i think) are summoned by the author of twsa? or a coincidence. imagine if these monsters became real after this series finishes
2,"Apr 26, 2021","reading this again is giving me chills, so good"
2,"Apr 26, 2021","I love that...idk if its called an analogy or what but the way he talks about the genre of his life is just so interesting to me. reminds me of when I say I'm just an npc in the world who helps the mains along their quest haha. that last line was especially inpactful ""that was the moment the genre of my life changed"" "
2,"Apr 26, 2021","his long time connection to the story kind areminds me of the first buttons I started reading. the days that let play, lore Olympus, and unordinary end will be bittersweet. like many others I used to read ex. ecstacy hearts, hooky, and good day to be a dog, they'll be just treasured memories from when I was secretly reading them in my elementary school classroom and not paying attention to the lesson haha"
2,"Apr 26, 2021",WOOOOOOOPOOOO[OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO9O9OOO99999999999O9O9OOOOOOOOOOOOKKIIOOIOKOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO K HI KCSNKXJOPOOOOOOOOOOOOOIIJ9OIO999OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
2,"Apr 24, 2021","Spoilers kinda, not really







Interesting how nowhere in the prologue can you see Lee Hyungsang, or Kim Namwoon. Although we can't see Han (forgot last name so Mommy will suffice) so it may not be that big of a detail."
2,"Apr 22, 2021",I’ll see you all in the next 10 years🌝
2,"Apr 21, 2021",Free trial of life is literally over
2,"Apr 18, 2021","i just realized, look how dokja looks like a cute little squishy baby in the first episodes but now he looked like he aged 20 years😂 but in a good way ofc"
2,"Apr 18, 2021","[The constellation 'Angel of Broke Weebs' is immersed in the story.]
[A like has been sponsored.]"
2,"Apr 18, 2021","Coming back to this from much further in the web novel is very surreal. Feels very immersing :) Especially the writing on the last page of the novel. It's practically ensuring Dokja that he'll survive no matter what, but it seems he completely forgot about it later on due to all that was happening."
2,"Apr 13, 2021",I really am sooo happy that I downloaded webtoon back! I would have never find such a interesting Webtoon! 
2,"Apr 4, 2021",I feel Inspired to read this . Even if It'll take me 10 years
2,"Mar 28, 2021","bruh, this is like those 2021 memes that say 'tutorial has ended, main game starts now'"
2,"Mar 20, 2021",He talking about the end of his favorite webnovel will be me with the last chapter of One Piece
2,"Mar 18, 2021","I like how the main chareveter is just a normal guy, and not someone who has been working towards whatever going to happen (haven't read ahead dw), but he seems to just be going through life as it is"
2,"Mar 18, 2021",is it just me? or does he look a lil like Sung Jin Woo
2,"Mar 14, 2021",I wonder why the ratings of this series was so high. After 1st episode everything became clear 
2,"Mar 8, 2021",B.. But Dokja.. You're the fictional character and protagonist here🥺✨
2,"Feb 28, 2021",Bullied in school? Single and alone his whole life? Me! 😂😢

2,"Feb 17, 2021",I love Kim DokJa
2,"Feb 14, 2021",3000 episodes please I would take that as a challenge I mean I  have nothing better to do so that would be awesome😄
2,"Feb 14, 2021",just wait this is so amazing i read it twice and the drawings are fabulous this need to be animated ☺️
2,"Feb 12, 2021",so much thoughts rn and one of them is  to give dokja a hug
2,"Feb 8, 2021","And now we're the ""readers"" and you're the ""protagonist"" "
2,"Feb 7, 2021",that is a lot of fourth wall breaks.
2,"Feb 3, 2021",this is just. so good. omg
2,"Jan 31, 2021",the author kinda sus BXKSBXKSJXKSJXJBDKXJXKS
2,"Jan 22, 2021",I'm rereading this and I just noticed that if Dokja didn't read the comic to the end wouldn't his life have stayed the same???
2,"Jan 20, 2021",omg this is so Good im hooked
2,"Jan 20, 2021",Solo leveling vibes? anyone?

2,"Jan 3, 2021","what the, the heart button is crazy it's 99,999+"
2,"Jan 2, 2021",You can find the finished novel version of this at https://readnovelfull.com/omniscient-readers-viewpoint.html. I’ve just finished reading it and it’s really good 
2,"Jan 1, 2021",So he has been reading it since he was 18? Interesting.
2,"Dec 29, 2020",Its basically about 2020's endingHappy New Year Soon..........
2,"Dec 26, 2020",this art style is exactly like solo leveling. if someone told me they were written by the same author I would believe them
2,"Dec 25, 2020","After rereding I'm questioning what the author meant by ""paid content"". I want Dokja to be the only one to have read the novel, really hope others don't get to read it by paying coins 😠😖"
2,"Dec 25, 2020","woah these episodes are pretty long, and that i love"
2,"Dec 24, 2020",Guess I'll stick around
2,"Dec 19, 2020",I'm so angry at the fact that she asked him what was happening. B*TCH IM HERE WITH YOU YOU THINK I KNOW???

2,"Nov 26, 2020",this should become a tv series
2,"Nov 20, 2020","so by reading it, he technically caused the end of the world?l
"
2,"Nov 19, 2020",Dokja reminds me of Sung Jinwoo
2,"Nov 15, 2020",And events like these my friends is why I do not like the idea of myself being in a reincarnation story. Cuz honestly I'd probably die so fast when it's one where u gotta survive.
2,"Nov 9, 2020",As I wait for a new chapter I chose to come back and reread from the beginning cause I was so into the story I feel I might’ve missed something’s therefore ima take my time this go around keep up the good work cause this is a great story
2,"Nov 7, 2020",i really like the vibe. <3
2,"Nov 7, 2020","I write too and it really is motivating, even if there is only one reader, to receive a comment of praise. I really felt that. "
2,"Nov 7, 2020",we hit paid content in March. yay. 
2,"Nov 1, 2020",sanga just built different
2,"Oct 28, 2020",pretty crappy gift if ya ask me
2,"Oct 28, 2020",as a webnovel reader it's amazing to see how many tiny details are huge plot points in the future
2,"Oct 23, 2020",I like this concept: a world where it changes the moment a series becomes paid content. I believe this world is influenced by the real world through different types of media. 😯
2,"Oct 23, 2020","""Sir, your present is delivered"" 😃"
2,"Oct 20, 2020",after I ve finished reading SOLO LEVELING LN and being updated to the manhwa ...I d never thought I will find something SO INTERESTING to read 🔥🔥🤘
2,"Oct 20, 2020",RIGHT when he got the vibrating phone I got a vibrating notification-
2,"Oct 19, 2020","Sooooo am I supposed to skip over the fact that the main character is 28 yo, started reading the novel in 8th grade, and read it for ten years. Idk about the math but... this mans was 18 yo in the 8th grade 👁👄👁"
2,"Oct 16, 2020",3000 chapters? weak. We can read that nonstop! 
2,"Oct 16, 2020",This is so good omg. 
2,"Oct 16, 2020","brooo, I'm hooked now.."
2,"Oct 16, 2020",I love how the episode was so long
2,"Oct 16, 2020","This is really good! And I wasn't able to keep myself from crying 😭 Dokja was reading that web novel series for 10 years, ofc he'll be too attached to it. And the fact that he depended on TWSA during his bad and most down times is sad and relatable. Actually, it's what I'm doing rn lol. Reading webtoon— diving into fiction, so I could forget reality even just for a second. Anyway, I believe we are all different and unique in our own ways. Meaning, there will be people who will achieve greater +"
2,"Oct 16, 2020",Don’t worry I’m pretty sure everyone reading this feels the same way when our favorite web ends

2,"Aug 26, 2020","Hoodie wingman that gave up his seat (and stole her bike - you know he did!) is the real MVP here. He's the hero this comic deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So he quietly gave up his seat without attention seeking or fanfare, and went to collect his new bicycle, leaving our MC to enjoy the spotlight."
2,"Aug 26, 2020","This episode hooked me. Started reading for the coin event, will probably use those coins to fast pass. "

2,"Aug 26, 2020",artstyle seems so similar to Solo Leveling. is this a thing now cuz i'm seeing a lot of recent manhwa with the same art style.
2,"Aug 25, 2020",That really piqued my interest. 
2,"Aug 25, 2020",cue attack on titain opening
2,"Aug 25, 2020","IHHHH this is so good! I first came because of coins, but now when that pop up came up to show me my progress, I just impatiently closed it cause I was reading and it interrupted me"
2,"Aug 25, 2020",TLS123 = The Last Survivor? Was MC the person who wrote the story? As well as winning the contest being surviving the apocalypse. I’m probably thinking too into this... :/
2,"Aug 25, 2020",This webtoon is so good 😍 thank you so much! I will read this even if I am the only one reading too 😭✨✨✨
2,"Aug 25, 2020","Omg all the other manhwas webtoon app told me to read to get coins have been ‘meh’ ‘it’s alright’, but THIS! I read that short synopsis at the top of this manhwa page and I subscribed right away! And I’m only at episode 1 and I can already say I LOVE IT! XD this is gonna be so fun! It’s been a ‘free planetary service’ and from now on it’s gonna be a ‘paid content’ which means apocalypse haha wow!"

Fiction becomes the only real thing after a point of time, the solace, something you hang onto. What the?! So if TLS123's fic is now ""paid content"" & if i understand where this is going, is the universe now wanting to exact payments now that it's ""free services"" have been stopped? Am I getting this right? Even vaguely? 😯"

But after his exposition, he has not yet read the episode, he checks the app unsuccessfully to try to read it, and then the attack happens. His comment post, which the author responded to, was in anticipation of the final episode. So, did he read it or not?"
2,"Jun 9, 2021",DAMNNN!!

It seems like it might be more meaningful than just people who lost interest. (please keep spoilers to a minimum for folks reading for the first time)"
2,"Apr 26, 2021","But- But-- is there something wrong with reading web novels, Dokja? c'mon. we got to know you because of this :3"

Or would it have happened anyways even if no one read it, and no one would know what to do because they didn't read the book and since Dokja read the book he will know what to do?"

2,"Feb 18, 2021","Who wouldn't read a story with a good start, I even want lots of manhua or manga to have hundreds or thousands of chapters, I feel lonely sometimes or depressed when an anime/manhua/manga is at its end"

2,"Jan 6, 2021",omg whatttt
2,"Jan 5, 2021",For me it’s 6:00Coincidence? I THINK NOT-
2,"Jan 1, 2021",They really did just say your free trial of living ended
2,"Jan 1, 2021","F***. Wait. That means...the paid content implied that the world was for free use for humans and that story going paid means now humans will face repercussions or something. And that competition...what if that author was an angel or something, and the one who won the contest would decide the end of the world. If that's the case...this dude brought this disaster by continuing to read the story. Holy damn!......................Please LN readers, no spoilers. "

2,"Sep 26, 2020","Can someone please elaborate this for me? Dokja said he's been reading the web novel for 10 years, right? How would he have started reading it in eighth grade if he's currently 28? Wouldn't he be 18 when he first started reading TWSA? Is this just a typo or...?"
2,"Sep 26, 2020",cool this is really good i love the art and the cool storyline it's cool that you have that big of an imagination to write this great job and keep up the good work
2,"Sep 26, 2020",He kind of reminds me of Kaneki. where my weebs at UwU
2,"Sep 26, 2020",I love the art style!! this is a great story so far!
2,"Sep 26, 2020",I love how while everyone is panicking Dokja is just thinking about the novel becoming paid content.

2,"Sep 16, 2020","Ugh.. they actually changed the names and are using only the first names instead of first and last! They didn´t do that in the novel or in the original korean webtoon ;-;
Don´t Dokja and Sanga me ugh! It´s Kim Dokja and Yoo Sangah"
2,"Sep 15, 2020",What? ... WHAT?
2,"Sep 15, 2020","Damn, I read this in a light novel version just some months ago and now I have a webtoon version, I can't wait to read it in picturesque form ☺️, can't wait for more chapters"
2,"Sep 13, 2020",Why does the characters look likes the character in solo leveling? 
2,"Sep 13, 2020",Is it possible that if there had been no reader this would never have happened?? I got this feeling
2,"Sep 12, 2020",The art is sickkk!!!  can't wait to read all(☆▽☆) this is gonna be my first webtoon story to read and it's already amazing ❤️❤️
2,"Sep 12, 2020",Well this picture is about the same with solo leve***** so wow gotta save this to my favorite now

2,"Sep 10, 2020",whoop I'm excited for this!!
2,"Sep 10, 2020",this is exciting with the covid thing affe ting all the world and all conspiracies coming out and religious and non religious prophecies this comic really fits this time period
2,"Sep 9, 2020",I hope one day we can see solo levelimg here 
2,"Sep 9, 2020",I get why the webnovel Dokja is reading is paid content now... we are the ones paying for it with coins lol clever WEBTOON creator 😝
2,"Sep 9, 2020",Ok where the fucking novel at can someone tell me the web site plz ( つ•̀ω•́)つ
2,"Sep 9, 2020","i like how it said that the ""free service has come to an end"". this is totally how i feel when i finish the free trials."
2,"Sep 9, 2020","ok not me being a college student and wasting my time doing things like reading webtoons instead of doing work :,)))))"

2,"Sep 4, 2020","Im 100% going to read the webnovel, this seems absolutely amazing"
2,"Sep 3, 2020",👏 This 👏  Is 👏  epic 👏 
2,"Sep 3, 2020",somehow this series remind me of Shin Megami Tensei : Devil Survivor 2
2,"Sep 3, 2020",If I was the only reader I’d have all of it downloaded offline because it’s only me! I know for a fact I’d do it. Although I get it. Stealing content is bad so why even use that as a plot element so idk but for reals if other readers only made it to 50 and you’ve read 1000s by yourself phew I’d download it. Especially to compile the best parts maybe certain arcs etc. would at least get a few reads from my friends or in his case co workers.
2,"Sep 3, 2020", its just me or the 2 main characters look a like the ones on solo leveling?
2,"Sep 3, 2020",‘Someone stole my bike’ ｍｉｓｔｙ　ｉｓ　ｔｈａｔ　ｙｏｕ
2,"Sep 3, 2020",So terrifying but exciitng at same time
2,"Sep 2, 2020",woah now I'm starting to imagine if my favorite webtoons will come to life
2,"Sep 2, 2020",Love it. 🙌🏼
2,"Sep 2, 2020",Bri this is a good series i started reading becuz of an instagram ad and it was a good choice to do
2,"Sep 2, 2020","Uh guys,I started reading this and the other two webtoons for the coin challenge and then I kinda started enjoying them a lot but it stopped giving that little stamp book notification thingy to tell me that I finished another chapter for the challenge ;-; does anyone know why"
2,"Sep 1, 2020",So what was the gift? Was it the author just expressing his gratitude to dojka?
2,"Sep 1, 2020",WOAH!!! So awesomely intense!!
2,"Sep 1, 2020",I wonder is this gonna be kinda like sweet home?
2,"Sep 1, 2020",this was so nice
2,"Sep 1, 2020",I am so into this- like woah-
2,"Aug 31, 2020","Almost everything in this chappy, after reading the novel it just hits different lmao"
2,"Aug 31, 2020",Now imagine what happened to him happens to us now... *Looks at time:* 7:30pm .. Thank god i still didn t finish it
2,"Aug 31, 2020",As a original novel reader... the thank you message was so... emotional for me... My ship is still Yoo Sangah though...
2,"Aug 31, 2020",Is it just or does this webtoon looks a lot like Solo Leveling?
2,"Aug 30, 2020",if I ever get married to a Korean or adopt a Korean child I will name my child dok-ja
2,"Aug 30, 2020",oh great and powerful author please tell us a week ahead of time if you ever need a hiatus or break so we can save a few episodes to sustain ourselves❤❤❤❤🙏🙏
2,"Aug 30, 2020",That 'Solo Leveling' vibes tho
2,"Aug 30, 2020",It should be illegal to have art this good
2,"Aug 30, 2020","um system, can we renew the free trial?"
2,"Aug 30, 2020",i already can tell its going to be lit
2,"Aug 30, 2020",And I thought I was dying from boredom they got a hell there
2,"Aug 30, 2020",i would totally read the novel he is reading .. I mean it's sad when you're favorite book or show ends ... I would rather it go on for 10 years 😂 than end in one session.... 
2,"Aug 29, 2020",couldn't wait ! so started reading the novel itself !😂
2,"Aug 29, 2020",Ok this is amazing! So many panels and the art is incredible!!! I’ve subscribed immediately 
2,"Aug 29, 2020",But wat was the present tho?
2,"Aug 29, 2020",WOW! I'm shooked
2,"Aug 29, 2020",Was the contest which series gets to be the end of the world?
2,"Aug 29, 2020","""the genre of my life changed"" this is... wos"
2,"Aug 29, 2020",I’M HOOKED!!!
2,"Aug 28, 2020","Yup, I'm officially hooked. This looks so freaking good!!! "
2,"Aug 28, 2020",I’m so drawn in!! 
2,"Aug 28, 2020",So when are we getting our present and 3146th ep
2,"Aug 28, 2020","please don't make this woman the heroin, please, please "
2,"Aug 28, 2020","hmm, what if the main character time travels and becomes the author???"
2,"Aug 28, 2020",I feel like this is educational...do be 2020 rn
2,"Aug 28, 2020","TBH, it's always a little corny when the loser, no ambition, live life just to get by type of character all of a sudden becomes relevant especially when their moral characteristics still shit. really cliche. hopefully this character emotionally grows and this isn't just some circle jerk novel of losers still being losers and we just have to just ignore all their crappy characteristics."
2,"Aug 28, 2020","Why called it ""TWSA""?, I love the short term ""Ways Of Survival"" of ""Three ways to survive in a Ruined world"" better. It's - Regressor, Returnee, Reincarnator."
2,"Aug 28, 2020",A little sad the dokja play on words and ivory life wasn’t included. I guess they just to translate the webtoon without having to explain the play on words
2,"Aug 28, 2020","Just came here and this already looks hella good, excited for the rest "
2,"Aug 28, 2020",isn't it a great feeling when the author gives their final thanks at the end?
2,"Aug 28, 2020",this is amazing.
2,"Aug 28, 2020",I get solo level vibes from this
2,"Aug 28, 2020",so at this point im theorizing that he the author and the guy that showed up is him from the future. (keep in mind im sharing my own thoughts and opinions.) Have a good day and be safe
2,"Aug 28, 2020","why am I reading this at 2020!!It was at that moment, I knew we're fucked up"
2,"Aug 27, 2020",He lowkey cute tho 👀 He kinda reminds me of Kenma tbh
2,"Aug 27, 2020",Im getting so hooked already 💓💓💞
2,"Aug 27, 2020",The title of the webtoon is really misleading; I am really glad I clicked on it<3
2,"Aug 27, 2020",omg i think this is gonna be a siiiick story
2,"Aug 27, 2020","this is kind of horror-like story, it gives me a goosebumps and blown my mind, I'm not good with these stuff yet I loved it."
2,"Aug 27, 2020",Loving thiiiis. Just a little weirded out by the Dokja Kim. I'm kinda used in calling him Kim Dokja. Have high hopes for the adaptation of Omni Reader! 
2,"Aug 27, 2020",Your Free Trial Of Life Has Run Out

2,"Aug 26, 2020",bITCH LEMME TELL YOU I HAD GOOSEBUMPS
2,"Aug 26, 2020",Firstly Congratulate the creators for such beginning of I hope become a master piece. Secondly what I can get from this chapter is the author of the novel is a kind of god who needed at least one person to read his novel until the end so he can become the novel reality. This new topic is pretty awesome.
2,"Aug 26, 2020","“Actually, someone stole my bicycle.” “You commute to work on a bike?” “No, I teleport. But in other news, someone stole my bicycle.”"
2,"Aug 26, 2020",OMG this looks so awesome! I LIVE for this genre of webtoon
2,"Aug 26, 2020","Is it just me or does the art looks a lot like the one in Solo Leveling? Is it the same author or? (sorry, I don't remember the name of the SL author 😅) "
2,"Aug 26, 2020",don't forget to like the episodes!
2,"Aug 26, 2020","holy crap, I got goose bumps"
2,"Aug 26, 2020","This Is AWESOME!! I also want the Earth, it's so boring, no Thrill n Action. I want everything to be changed like this where I will be the Protagonist!!!"
2,"Aug 26, 2020",you can read up to ch 18 on mangakakalot
2,"Aug 26, 2020","I'm pretty sure Three Ways of Surviving A Ruined World was shortened as Ways of Survival. But I guess that's fine now I get to see what a Dokkaebi looks like. I kinda find it hard to imagine, I also imagine then as winged sheep people."
2,"Aug 26, 2020",his battery life rlly something

2,"Jul 13, 2022",So did he ever open the email?  i can't tell
2,"Jul 10, 2022",Reread again it been so long 
2,"Jul 9, 2022","(THIS IS NOT HATE)At the start of this episode I thought it was pretty boring but it just took a sharp turn down into my favorites. I lidget just started watching this and it's very good! very surprising, too."
2,"Jul 9, 2022",now I understand
2,"Jul 8, 2022",i've seen this webtoon ALL OVER my fyp so i decided to read it. as of now...it ain't disappointing

2,"Jul 7, 2022",The moment when you hear the final boss music. “SHIT!”
2,"Jul 6, 2022",OoOOoOh
2,"Jul 5, 2022",The comment to like ratio is bothering me. Keep reading it only gets more interesting
2,"Jul 1, 2022",imagine being 28 and a webtoon addict. And I read webtoon while travelling the subway to home from work! 😶😶
2,"Jun 30, 2022",So how he 28 read this novel for 10 years but started the novel in 8th grade.. your like 13-14 in 8th grade and 10 years would be 24 not 28..
2,"Jun 30, 2022",Haruki Murakami is one of my favorites authors as well 🤔
2,"Jun 29, 2022","it was at this moment he knew, he fucked up."
2,"Jun 29, 2022",Okay. This story made me overthink. Because what if when I finish reading this this will happen too. Hahaha kidding
2,"Jun 29, 2022",I’m so happy this is a Manhwa now!! The web novel was so good!!!

2,"Jun 25, 2022",Rereading this masterpiece 🍵
2,"Jun 12, 2022",So considering the author “won a contest” and knew that the pdf would help dokja. It was probably a story contest for the constellations to submit their stories and the winner’s story would be “published” on earth

2,"Jun 9, 2022",the WHAT 😃
2,"Jun 7, 2022",well here I go figure as is the nature of this webtoon I should stay in theme and will also endeavor to comment on each episode. thanks for all the content the series has been great thus far!
2,"Jun 6, 2022",wishing this would happen to me ong
2,"Jun 5, 2022",Another story that I will catch up into until the recent episode.
2,"Jun 5, 2022",one word...waw😳❤️

2,"Jun 3, 2022",That front line military service training is really going to help now-
2,"Jun 3, 2022",rereading and i just saw the hints ?!&@
2,"Jun 3, 2022",love the art quality
2,"Jun 3, 2022",Random note but now on my 5th time reading this chapter I finally registered that part of the reason Dokja is alive is because he was probably trained in hand to hand combat during his 2 years in the military 
2,"Jun 3, 2022",someone that made a lot of effort to build the life he is living: *dies* / someone that didn't do anything besides of reading a history: *lives 😎👌*
2,"Jun 2, 2022",your free trial of life has ended 😆
2,"May 31, 2022","wait but if he spent 10 years reading it and he's 28, then why is he reading the story since 8th grade?"
2,"May 30, 2022",Knowing the rate at which I blow through episodes of great series like this one I’d probably finish 3000 episodes in a week. As you can see I have a problem.
2,"May 30, 2022",He looks kind of the same with a guy sponsored by a pepper spray
2,"May 30, 2022",the idea of a solar system running out of its trial time is awfully similar to Dungeon Crawler Carl. idk if the author is borrowing from that series or not
2,"May 29, 2022",The Dokja becomes the PROTAGONIST LEGGO
2,"May 29, 2022",man as much as I want the genre of my life to change I don't think I have what it takes to be a protagonist
2,"May 28, 2022","(Mild spoilers) Wait. Coming back I can’t help but notice the „contest“ the author was talking about. Maybe the contest was about what reality will become, so only because TWSA won Dokja is at an advantage. This still leaves questions open, like was the contest only about this worlds scenarios or is the star stream itself also entirely because of TWSA?"
2,"May 24, 2022",im guessing he's the author in the future giving himself the knowledge to save the world?

2,"Mar 15, 2022","do the authors isolate that grasshopper to symbolize how it was captured from its wild, natural habitat and placed into a cage like how dokja belongs to fiction but was placed into a non-fictitious world or is it just because the grasshopper will serve some other purpose to the plot"

2,"Mar 10, 2022","wait what.. he started reading it in 8th grade, took him 10 years, and I'm pretty sure he's 28.. so either the schooling system is weird (for me 8th grade is middle school age cuz America, so I could be wrong n 8th grade is actually the equivalent of being a hs senior), he's actually 23 or 24 n I read the age wrong, or it took him more than 10 years"
2,"Mar 10, 2022",sooo good （x_x；）
2,"Mar 9, 2022",Free service? On this planet? Where??

2,"Feb 26, 2022",I feel like this is similar to solo max level newbie
2,"Feb 24, 2022","He doesn't have to be shy about reading webnovels, it's kinda cool to be a bit different, as a grown adult person. And support small individual artists.
Would the world end, if he had 0 readers?!"
2,"Feb 23, 2022",He was prolly paid by God to make a plot for the world tbh
2,"Feb 23, 2022",your free trial of life has ended

2,"Sep 15, 2020","Damn, looks like I spoke too soon about him having a girl😬. I'm wondering how the author got his number, but had to ask for his email address. Like, how did he even acquire that much? I suppose I shouldn't question that tho since he (or whoever he is in cahoots with) literally brought fiction to life. If he can do that, he can probably do anything lol. I suppose, in a way, it's Dokja's fault that everyone is in this mess, tho inadvertently😅..."
2,"Sep 15, 2020",The webtoon is quite interesting  with the great plot of  genre
2,"Sep 15, 2020",COOOOOOOOLL
2,"Sep 14, 2020",very new type concept  that how a novel reader can survive in the novel itself

2,"Sep 10, 2020","Umm, are eighth graders not 13-14 in Korea or smth? Cuz he started reading twsa or whatever in eighth grade. He'd be 13 or 14. He'd read it for 10 years until it ended, after eighth grade. That'd make him 23 or 24, but he's 28
Edit: Actually, he had to do military service and might not have read it during that, so maybe it was 10 years total, but not consistently throughout the years."
2,"Sep 10, 2020",the beginning of this is me when it said wait for solo leveling and tower of God 
2,"Sep 10, 2020",I'm going to nitpick about the age thing. If that was a ten year journey and he is 28 wouldn't he have started near the end of 12th grade? 8th grade is around 12-14.
2,"Sep 9, 2020",nice one

So I’d recommend y’all to give him a voice according to that (it’s pretty tough to decide voices of the characters, especially in a webtoon). Example: Does anyone remember that ROAST? Yoo Sangah: I think it’s speaking Spanish....should I talk to it? Dokja: NO! What are you gonna do huh? Ask it for money? S. A. V. A. G. E."

2,"Aug 24, 2020",I have a good feeling about this webtoon 😁
2,"Aug 24, 2020",mc: would i be the protagonist?the author: hehe idk sure 
2,"Aug 24, 2020","Okay but like.. you really shouldn’t be ashamed of reading webcomics, bc 9 times out of ten, I’ll ask a whole group of ppl if they have webtoon. And someone will say ""yeah which ones do you read?"""
2,"Aug 24, 2020",wowie this protagonist seems like me. too bad I live in a non-fiction world. something like that won't happen to me anyway 
2,"Aug 24, 2020",THIS IS SO COOL
2,"Aug 24, 2020","the author is Haruki Murakami. great novels, a little on the weird side. "
2,"Aug 24, 2020",this is getting interesting! I like it!!! 
2,"Aug 24, 2020",Wow this hits really close to home at how the mc is just a reader even though he wants to be something more....I think everyone has experienced that once in their lives...especially me...
2,"Aug 24, 2020",you have my attention go on give 5% of interest to it gl
2,"Aug 24, 2020","I'm a native speaker of spanish so when she told him that she was learning the phrase ""could you lend me some money"" I freaked out, thinking ""Omg, when did I changed the language?"" 🤣"
2,"Aug 24, 2020",reading this gives me all types of creeped out goosebumps. I love it.
2,"Aug 24, 2020",This manga feels like solo levelling!!! 😍😍
2,"Aug 24, 2020",Was there a multiversal betting pool on how the story would end up or what?
2,"Aug 24, 2020",I'm getting goosebumps..tbh I want to change the genre of my life too
2,"Aug 24, 2020",I could already tell this will be a favorite 
2,"Aug 24, 2020",whoah heavy text font at the end there 😅
2,"Aug 24, 2020",this is really cool
2,"Aug 24, 2020",wow man this much long episod . i wish if solo leveling also had this much long episod i am tired of waiting for new episodes and then  short episodes are there its frustrating man.
2,"Aug 24, 2020",Excuse me hasn’t Tower of God been going on for like 15 years? It only has like 400 chapters! Does that mean that an episode was posted every day or something. 
2,"Aug 24, 2020",Yes....your genre of your life changed from dark past to horrific......
2,"Aug 24, 2020",This is a rather good find
2,"Aug 24, 2020",okay omg this story is so interesting. I like it a lot
2,"Aug 24, 2020",Omg i am liking this a lot ❤️
2,"Aug 24, 2020",Y’all should really read it! I only got to the 18 chapter but it was really good!
2,"Aug 24, 2020",so...... is TWSA a real webnovel??? or. I just dumgb😂
2,"Aug 24, 2020",is it just me or the mc here looks a lot like Sung Jin-woo (solo Leveling)
2,"Aug 24, 2020","Wow... amazing and really long chapters, I love that. "
2,"Aug 24, 2020","so far, i’m loving this!"
2,"Aug 24, 2020",Woahhh!!!! This is so damn cool!!!!
2,"Aug 24, 2020",I read it for the coins and now I'm addicted. 
2,"Aug 24, 2020",I don't know why but I imagined Megalovania playing in this episode.( If anyone knows the game Undertale at all ;-;)
2,"Aug 24, 2020","I have to say it, this plot is something amazing!"
2,"Aug 24, 2020",this series reminds me of DICE it such a good webtoon!
2,"Aug 24, 2020",aka your free trial of life has ended 
2,"Aug 24, 2020",The fact that Sanga is learning spanish makes me really happy. Maybe it's dumb but my native language is spanish and I love when it's mentioned in fiction ❤️
2,"Aug 24, 2020",My hobby is reading serialized web novels on the subway..... I feel you
2,"Aug 24, 2020",This is a top tier 
2,"Aug 24, 2020",This is soo cool
2,"Aug 24, 2020",looking forward to the next chapter..it is getting exciting
2,"Aug 24, 2020",wow.. this is good (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤
2,"Aug 24, 2020",i was just here for coins but damn this looks good
2,"Aug 24, 2020","bruh... if that was me, i would still die even though i read what was gonna happen cause i have short term memory (HAHA) & i would have forgotten everything i read in the past 10 years."
2,"Aug 24, 2020","This is my theory (and somebody else may have already mentioned it since I can't read through 1000+ comments): it seems the devil is the author of the webnovel and since the author said he couldn't have made it unless Dokja had kept reading and commenting,  it seems that Dokja unwittingly brought on the apocalypse. 🤔🤯😶"
2,"Aug 24, 2020","I  want the gender of my life to change too, please. "
2,"Aug 24, 2020",Just keeps getting better and better. I love it!
2,"Aug 24, 2020",that last line about his gentr changing was great
2,"Aug 24, 2020",This reminds me of solo leveling 
2,"Aug 24, 2020",im wondering about the app thing tho.. what does she mean with app??
2,"Aug 24, 2020","The creator of this comic is amazing, just the size of one episode is worthy of praise let alone the content!"
2,"Aug 24, 2020","""why do i hear boss music?"""
2,"Aug 24, 2020",So glad it’s on here now theyre farther ahead then this dont know why it’s not updated completely you can find up to episode like 18 in English 
2,"Aug 24, 2020",I’m so glad I got introduced to such great webtoons through the free coins challenge. I can already tell this is going to be an amazing one
2,"Aug 24, 2020",is the guy that made the story like the master if earth or something? 
2,"Aug 24, 2020",OMG THIS IS SO COOL 😄
2,"Aug 24, 2020",*also hides what I'm reaxing*

2,"Aug 24, 2020",😲
2,"Aug 24, 2020",Is there more episodes on webnovel?
2,"Aug 24, 2020","“Reading it while he was bullied in school.” I don’t like that, let me throw hands 🤜😡"
2,"Aug 24, 2020",pfft when dokja moved his phone away when the girl went to see is relatable 😔
2,"Aug 24, 2020","omg now i hope they make a webtoon of ""Trash of the Count's family"" "
2,"Aug 23, 2020",She got that Bayang 
2,"Aug 23, 2020","solo leveling vibes or just me, maybe its the artist style or something idk"
2,"Aug 23, 2020",Could anyone tell me what novel you all are talking about I have no idea
2,"Aug 23, 2020",looks like the mc of solo levelling
2,"Aug 23, 2020",Is this what happens when light novels finally and actually finish
2,"Aug 23, 2020",Sung jin-woo is that u ? 
2,"Aug 23, 2020",😱😱

2,"Aug 22, 2020","OK.... OK I'm hooked
Ngl, I skipped some of the sad monolog but it still hit close to home"
2,"Aug 22, 2020",Is it the wrong time to say his name reminds me of doja cat? :D yes? Whoops.
2,"Aug 22, 2020",This reminds me of the hitchhiker's guide the galaxy
2,"Aug 22, 2020",my question who wrote the web novel? did they survive? 
2,"Aug 22, 2020",This is by far one of the longest WEBTOON I think I’ve ever seen
2,"Aug 22, 2020",Wait so the planet was on a free trial?!
2,"Aug 22, 2020",Play Giorno's theme alreadyy
2,"Aug 22, 2020",WOOOOW THIS SOUNDS SO GOOD ALREADY

2,"Aug 22, 2020",Im already IN LOVE with this webtoon💕Im going to read EVERY update till the end❤️ It looks so interesting!!!! I just cant wait to read all the next updates!!!!❤️💕
2,"Aug 22, 2020",man's *genre* changed
2,"Aug 22, 2020",So I was thinking you know after all this happened why wouldn’t people go look up the story and try reading it but then I figured there was no Internet since the world is an apocalypse now but no it all makes sense of course When comics get featured all of their content is deleted but you always get a notice and I love how they fit that into this episode and it makes it feel more real for the readers because we actually feel like we’re in his place!
2,"Aug 22, 2020",Me immediately thinking that this is some Truman Show kinda thing and that all of what will progress is actually the tv version of the series with him as protagonist and that’s why it’s become paid content
2,"Aug 22, 2020",why does the drawing off the manga remind me of solo leveling 
2,"Aug 22, 2020","Ooohhh..... who else is excited to see what happens next?! Can't wait, I think this is going to be a good one! Love the art style. "
2,"Aug 21, 2020",So is this like his fault or something? Like would this not have happened if he didn't support the author and help him 'publish' it?
2,"Aug 21, 2020",The hell Bruce?!
2,"Aug 21, 2020",this is amazing
2,"Aug 21, 2020",oop-
2,"Aug 21, 2020","Can I go to the Noblesse World too? lol This Webtoon is so good, can't wait ♡"
2,"Aug 21, 2020",I love the diversity of art in webtoon but man I just love this type of artstyle
2,"Aug 21, 2020",me: sings 'I will survive!' 🎶🎶🎵
2,"Aug 21, 2020",Imagine taking ten years I’d knock that out in a week tops 
2,"Aug 21, 2020",This series is going to be epic
2,"Aug 21, 2020",If only there could be a webtoon that lasted 10 years. Started reading Berserk almost 20years ago and the wait is no joke :p
2,"Aug 21, 2020",Damn I can't stop reading it now😂💙
2,"Aug 21, 2020",THIS IS SO COOL

2,"Aug 21, 2020",so good I don't often comment but the plot twist when it hit 7 just hit different
2,"Aug 21, 2020",Sung Jin-woo is that you? 
2,"Aug 20, 2020","""Isekai"" station coming up... ""Isekai"" station coming up! "
2,"Aug 20, 2020",What would happen if we read this series for ten years until the end and at the end of that ten years this happens to us too? Mild coincidence.
2,"Aug 20, 2020",so coool.
2,"Aug 20, 2020",Wth this webtoon is super hype. I'm for sure reading it. The art style is super cool as well.

2,"Aug 20, 2020",imagine if canvas webtoons became real whem they get featured   ... woww

2,"Aug 20, 2020",dun dun duunnnn
2,"Aug 20, 2020",man !!!! it's give me chills at the last time♥️♥️
2,"Aug 20, 2020",Dude i can already tell that this is gonna become one of my favorites
2,"Aug 20, 2020","It's great that after solo leveling season 1 ended, I think this would be a yet another great webtoon. Well, the two are no comparison for each other but still I'm looking forward to the webtoon. Hope you like the webtoon.Hope Jin-woo is alright in this ""GENRE"""
2,"Aug 20, 2020",i’m very excited to read this story but omg it was annoying me so much how he kept IGNORING THE GIRL FJDJDJ DUDE PLS RESPOND TO HER 😂😂

2,"Aug 20, 2020",I feel I am a real dokja now. Lol 😂
2,"Aug 20, 2020","Dude if you stopped living inside a fantasy world in your head and tried hard you would be able to do anything you wanted to unless what you want is to write a fantasy novel/movie/comic then you would have to be thinking about it as it's your job . I understand that with the trauma of bullying people tend to use books, novels , music etc as a scape but nothing will change if you don't learn how to control this. He was excited about the girl getting on train +"
2,"Aug 20, 2020",I COULD DEFINITELY RELATE TO READING WEBTOON ON MY WAY TO SCHOOL AND ETC.!!! 
2,"Aug 20, 2020",and the monster be like nom nom nom
2,"Aug 20, 2020",So. First screaming panel.Woman on the left. Did she die already? Her eyes are completely white.
2,"Aug 20, 2020",So i came to webtoons and found this novel on my front page. Is it me or does it make us feel like we are the few people that read this and soon at the end we will have our own apocalypse.
2,"Aug 20, 2020",Appa is that you?
2,"Aug 20, 2020",I mean technically it did not change now all books a fact no more fiction
2,"Aug 20, 2020",B-but- idk if ppl would ask cuz- we'd relate lol if a Webtoon ended 😂
2,"Aug 20, 2020",I laughed so freezing hard I'm sorry
2,"Aug 20, 2020",So if he hadn’t finished the series ig everything would’ve been fine then.  And there’s just a bunch of powerful space gods that write comics all day ig

2,"Aug 20, 2020",Wow :) I'm staying.
2,"Aug 20, 2020",great art and an even greater storykeep up
2,"Aug 20, 2020","""if the genre of my life wasn't non-fiction but fantasy could i he the protagonist"" I feel u on that quote (btw I paraphrased)"
2,"Aug 20, 2020","I'm Hispanic, so I speak Spanish as well as English. so when it said, ""¿Puedes prestarme dinero?"" I was like, ""NO!"" in a mexican accent. Also Puedes is Can you, and Please is por favor, so it didnt say Please lend me some money. It said Can you. Sorry for the correction. or should I say, lo siento? "
2,"Aug 20, 2020",how is he single!? ...I'd hit that...😂

2,"May 24, 2021","The author of Three ways to survive the end of the world is cruel. He/she makes it paid content to reduce the possibility of humanity finding a way to survive. Plus the large page count/episodes is intentional so as to make interested readers lose interest as well as design a detailed story on how he/she would want to world to end. 
of course this is a theory."

I have been working on an idea for start up  and planned for it . It is a creativity field start up .
If you are talented and passionate about  creating comics , animatory work and stories  ( writers ) .please give me 2 min of your time to go through this .

This field of creativity is not often encouraged or promoted in our country . Therefore, most passionate artists either pursue stable jobs or would move abroad pursuing their interests . That's why , I came up with the idea"

2,"Aug 19, 2020","Aaah, this series looks so cool! I’m excited!"
2,"Jul 16, 2021",Dokja's reaction is me when I read to fast
2,"Jul 15, 2021",soooo good
2,"Jun 17, 2021","oh my, i have goose bump ! i am so eager to read the next chapter... you will excuse me, i will stop to write this and go read ! 💖"
2,"Jun 9, 2021",Looks like solo leveling
2,"Jun 2, 2021",He looks so much like jinwoo from solo leveling.
2,"May 26, 2021","Do you think it's a prize? If ever I have a chance to claim a prize, I don't want to accept it😂 NEVER!!!"
2,"Apr 28, 2021","I don't like female mc that is so cheerful and easygoing, it is soo common, the guy will protect her because she is weak, she will keep giving him trouble and he will save her, cliche. I hooe they will give female mc's a different personality like, badass and is not weak and has a strong personality that will make a story good if both of them are powerful and cool😌 just opinion tho"
2,"Apr 27, 2021",Lmao when the Free-trial ends
2,"Feb 27, 2021",lol shit my dick has poop
2,"Jan 20, 2021",I just came here to ask if how can I get coins without purchasing ? I mean free 😅
2,"Dec 9, 2020",Is that a cha-hae in rip off I see?
2,"Oct 18, 2020","Webtoon has the nerve to charge coins. Available on multiple websites and 4 chapters in advance.  Example you could pay up to ch. 22 like I did, or you can go read up to ch. 26 for nothing like I should have."
2,"Oct 17, 2020","Honestly, the protagonist seems kind of a loser... Laments his entire life, says things would be different for him if only the world was different, holding other people up so above him due to the only superficial things he knows... But I know he'll get great, it's that new ""genre"" after all. Hoping for some good development!"
2,"Oct 16, 2020","I'm a Korean.I want to share this news, so I can't speak English well, but I use a translator to post it.Even if it's strange, I hope you understand.It is said that this webtoon is preparing to produce about hundreds of animations scheduled to be produced in the 5th season of the drama series.Please click below for articles. It is only Korean.  https://www.donga.com/news/article/all/20201013/103375743/1"

2,"Aug 19, 2020","My connection died at ""At this rate you might get sucked into your phone."" and then everything after that was blank. I lowkey panicked for a minute, then things started to load again. 😬"
2,"Aug 19, 2020",holy hell that escalated quickly this story is crazy Lol 
2,"Aug 19, 2020",I wish a cute guy would stare at me like that welp can’t relate 😢
2,"Aug 19, 2020","Why does the shortened version of the web novel name change from TSWA, to TWSA, to TSA, all in the same episode?"
2,"Aug 19, 2020","THANK YOU FINALLY, IT'S HERE. "
2,"Aug 19, 2020","Okay, first of all... they haven't changed any of the names too much, thank God!Secondly... the translation missed a few good points. 
Such as Dokja saying the reason his life was non-fiction was because he was a ""reader"" (Dokja) not a ""protagonist"".
Sangah means ""ivory"" in Korean. When she talked about being inspired earlier, it was about the fact that she could live out an ""ivory"" life. "
2,"Aug 19, 2020",its so ironic that im getting solo leveling ads 😂😂
2,"Aug 19, 2020",My man Dokja really do be such a mood tho
2,"Aug 19, 2020",Love this!
2,"Aug 19, 2020",uH iM SoRrY i didn't know becoming a paid series meant ending the world too my bad

2,"Aug 19, 2020",its moheree
2,"Aug 19, 2020",Something about the genre changing and now he's the protagonist since he can't be it in non-fiction.... sounds so cool-
2,"Aug 19, 2020",Thank you for such a long chapter right from the start ☺️
2,"Aug 19, 2020",oh my gosh I can't believe it's on webtoon now!!! This is one of my favorite manhwa
2,"Aug 19, 2020",Early gang

2,"Aug 19, 2020",Oh I love it 😍
2,"Aug 19, 2020","Whew! That was a long chap! Main character looks like someone from solo lvl. Now, the question is, can this webtoon join: The boxer, weak hero, hardcore lv warrior, gosu, tower of God"

2,"Aug 19, 2020",I bet she was using Duolingo.

2,"Aug 19, 2020",Webtoon got their hands on a really good manhwa! You guys won't be disappointed :)
2,"Aug 19, 2020",it's pretty amazing that the author still kept continuing to write his story despite having 1 reader. I would probably have moved to a different project if that was me tbh
2,"Aug 19, 2020",The thoughts about this concept is amazing in my opinion and I'm looking forward to reading this webtoon. 
2,"Aug 19, 2020",gee willikers how much I like these type of web novels is a tremendous amount

2,"Aug 19, 2020","her name is Yoo Sangah. even SANG-AH wouldve been fine. and the WN name is 'three ways to survive in a ruined world', not in the Apocalypse. also they misspelled contractor and Kim Dokja doesn't know the gender of the author so using HIM as a pronoun instead of Them --- PLSSSS DONT DO THIS TO SUCH A GOOD NOVEL CMON"
2,"Aug 19, 2020",Dokja do be looking good tho 😌

2,"Aug 19, 2020",I can sympathize with this guy so much webcomics help me get through a lot of things in my life and I don't know why but it just does it helps me cope with whatever is happening in my life and I don't think I would be the person I am today without them so thank you to all of the authors in the world thank you! :)
2,"Aug 19, 2020",CANT WAIT TO READ THE REST OMGGF

2,"Aug 19, 2020",the moment when u regret feeling sad abt living a slice-of-life story
2,"Aug 19, 2020",im ngl i would die for kim dokja 
2,"Aug 19, 2020",Wow I haven't even been on for a year and he already finished a series
2,"Aug 19, 2020",It’s already out on free websites. There’s already like 17 chapters
2,"Aug 19, 2020",Sorry for you poor souls who haven5 reader Chapter  17
2,"Aug 19, 2020",wow this is a quite a few chapters behind
2,"Aug 19, 2020",love the art!!!
2,"Aug 19, 2020",yep... I'm intrigued...😮
2,"Aug 19, 2020",2020 got this webtoon feeling too real 😔
2,"Aug 19, 2020",wait so when this comic ends does that mean the world is going to end-
2,"Apr 10, 2022","When I first read this I was like; ""His last name is Kim, is he related to my first grade teacher?!"""
2,"Jan 6, 2021",i love the art and also he reminds me of sung jin woo from solo leveling. 
2,"Aug 29, 2020",why does that bitch keep asking Dokja what's going on? like bitch it's hiS FIRST TIME TOO?!?! 
2,"Aug 19, 2020","The translation of this is really good! But... as THE woman respect Dokja would never assume their favorite author (or the author of TWSA) were men. Pls read ahead, dear translator, and don’t assume Dokja has your own biases!"
2,"Dec 13, 2020","Solo leveling eh, anyone, no one, okay..."
2,"Oct 21, 2020",WAS THAT A TITAN I JUST SAW?! I KNEW IT HAD THE VIBES OF AOT!😊
2,"Aug 29, 2020",But wouldn’t it suck knowing how it all ends?
2,"Aug 22, 2020",So you trying to tell me that he's not Sung Jin Woo? Yeah I call BS on that
2,"Sep 6, 2021",Holy hell this is starting off cringey af. I haven't read any manga in a while so I forgot about this stereotype of mc. I really hope they don't try force a romance between the mc and this 'most popular girl in school' stereotype.
2,"Jan 7, 2021","This story reminds me of solo leveling, and the ranker who lives again, but I love these kinds of stories and can't stop reading them."
2,"May 23, 2022","Well, that self pity bullshit attitude is precisely why your life is like that."
2,"Aug 20, 2020",So basically the story he was reading was from an alien and the planet is apart of the story and it now became paid when the story was done the free story that is
2,"May 14, 2021",solo leveling copycat. haha
2,"Aug 24, 2020",check out bts' new full english song 'dynamite' https://youtu.be/gdZLi9oWNZg
2,"May 5, 2022",I hate Sangah sm
2,"Aug 19, 2020","This comic sucks. It says the genre changed and it is implied that it changes to fantasy by complaining that he would be the protagonist of it was a fantasy, but it is clearly stated that this is an action WebtoonEdit: For the people who disliked this, it's a joke. I'm not that irrational"
2,"Aug 19, 2020",so you guys stole this one too huh motherfuckers you guys dont deserve this
2,"Dec 13, 2021",this has to be one of the most boring first episodes ever
2,"Sep 22, 2020",crap novel n webtoon.  tower of god is the best. 
2,"Aug 20, 2020",this looks boring ngl 
2,"Jan 7, 2021",it feels like its going to be trash*

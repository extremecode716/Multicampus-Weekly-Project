26,"Oct 28, 2020",I've had Webtoon for about 3 years now. some of my oldest comics I still read are UnOrdinary and Winter moon... but this comic has been such a ride and is everything I love that it has skyrocketed above those 2. this is definitely my favorite webtoon and every coin I spend is well worth it. thank you to the artist in giving such an amazing story with amazing art.

Honestly he treats his team kinda how batman treats his team. You can obviously tell he cares about his team and wants them to get better so they can survive. Though he also keeps them in the dark a lot because its better if they don't know everything. He's focus on the mission which is surviving and will do anything to survive woth in reason."

26,"Dec 16, 2020","I'm not criticizing but I definitely find it amusing that even in the post apocalyptic world, privilege and wealth will take you far and get you a head start on most anything. Luck definitely plays a role, but it factors into wealth which translates to power. Dokja having an omnicient reader's skill is icing on the cake for him to capitalize on that privilege."

27,"Nov 4, 2020","I love Gilyeong so much! I‚Äôm glad that he is in their group and can rely on Dokja. He‚Äôs also a great addition to the team, very smart and brave."
27,"Nov 4, 2020",Gilyeong drawing comfort from Dokja :‚Äô) it‚Äôs clear he seems to relate to him/is sympathetic in some way
27,"Nov 4, 2020","I feel like dokja has a similar trauma to gilyeong that's why he sympathizes with him so much, but on a lighter note I would gladly die for gilyeong like he's so precious for this cruel world"
27,"Nov 4, 2020","if you are reading this for free, hello, it is currently November 3rd, this chapter just released and everyone who also is with me today has made it to the point in the fast pass where we can't turn back. Please send help."

27,"Dec 17, 2020",Y'know I noticed that Dokja pat's Gilyeong's head quite often (definitely took rereading the comic to notice) and it's always so heartwarming. I can't wait for the next ep!!! I love the characters!!!

27,"Nov 9, 2020","For some reason, Gilyoung just have some sort of charm that just draws my attention...... I guess in an apocalyptic scenario, children were more precious (must protect) than ever even if they were forced to psychologically mature faster than usual."
27,"Nov 4, 2020",Gilyeong is such a precious boy! I am so curious on how he levels up throughout this story. Hope we get some of his backstory in the future. 
27,"Dec 23, 2020","I almost cried when Gilyeong hugged Dokja, even though we didn't see what he was seeing you can tell he has been through so much even before the Apocalypse "

27,"Dec 23, 2020","Gilyeong hugging Dokja was the most purest thing honestly. And I kinda have a good feeling about Jihye, I guess. If she joins them, I think it would be good for our gang."

27,"Jan 1, 2021",Makes me realize that this story is this good without really giving anyone's backstory. We barely know the MC's backstory even. That just shows how skilled the author and artist are.

27,"Apr 16, 2021","This is seriously the first time I‚Äôve been completely blown away by a webtoon novel. The hook, the writing, the drawings, the character development....all perfect. This series deserves an anime adaptation. I hope the author gets the recognition they deserve "
27,"Mar 11, 2021","wayyy better than i thought. i thought it would be like that one webtoon where the kid gains skills and knowledge just by touching things and he can use the skills in real life. that webtoon kinda bored me , so i stayed away from webtoons with game like themes. but this one. muah author. your the f*cking shit. i cant put it down. "
27,"Jan 2, 2021",i really loove how dokja doesnt neglect the fact that gilyeong? idk hos to spell but he doesnt neglect the fact that gilyeong needs comforting 
27,"Dec 30, 2020",Gilyeong and Dokja's relationship is the best.
27,"Dec 24, 2020",That explains why Gilyeong was on the subway alone...
27,"Dec 23, 2020",TWSA actually seems like it would be a pretty awesome webcomic - you have a main character who killed their best friend to stay alive. 
27,"Apr 28, 2021",not to be dramatic or anything but I WILL KILL FOR MA BOY GILYEONG
27,"Apr 26, 2021",I‚Äôm so glad Dokja is there for our baby Gilyeong. Idk about y‚Äôall but I literally cried when he hugged Dokjaüò≠

27,"Mar 20, 2021",Dokja has become Dadja
27,"Mar 13, 2021",i would die for gilyeong
27,"Jan 31, 2021","its the way he patted Gilyoung's head for me. That panel is just beautiful, like he saw himself reflected because both saw their moms"
27,"Jan 2, 2021","Am I the only one who finds hilarious the greeting of the Constellations? XD It'd be like ""Wasaaaaaap"""
27,"Dec 31, 2020",My heart broke when I saw Gilyeong‚Äôs illusory prison.... when he kept apologizing ))):
27,"Dec 30, 2020","Crap now I really wanna know Dokja‚Äôs past, like what the heck was that :0 and who the heck was that- also Gilyeong‚Äôs past- the poor kid needs a hug ü•∫"

27,"Dec 23, 2020",I wanna see Dokja‚Äôs past 
27,"Dec 23, 2020","Gilyeong is such a brave and smart little bean. He needs to be protected! I love how Dokja is concerned about him and that Gilyeong trusts him and seeks comfort from him. It's these little details that just blows me away, this story is so well done! I love it!"
27,"Dec 23, 2020","This chapter just confirmed that dokja has a bad past‚Äî we see only a glimpse of it, but he looked terrified üòî"
27,"Nov 4, 2020",I was right they did meet the high school girl anyway I want to hug gilyoung so much his so damn precious and I love how he hugged dokja it‚Äôs like he feels safe around him also I really wanted to see dokjas past too it seemed like that was his Mum in that illusion 
27,"Nov 4, 2020","The Lord of the Bleeding Wallet has nominated Gilyeong for most adorable character. 10,000,000 coins have been gifted."
27,"Apr 27, 2021","dokja is so interesting. level headed, calm, yet powerful mentally and physically, and occasionally a bit off his hinges. I can't tell how much he values human lives, something a little scary but also very entertaining. he slaughtered many of those bad people in the station a while back with ease, but also has humanity for his allies. "
27,"Dec 27, 2020",That‚Äôs rough. She killed her closest friend üò¨
27,"Dec 26, 2020","I just want to say, to all of you WEBTOON only readers. Prepare yourself for the much later chapters. The trauma truck hits hard ^^. (Read the novel if you're impatient.) Man I'm sad now... "
27,"Dec 26, 2020",I see what the author is doing they're trying to get us emotionally attached to gilyeong before they potentially kill him off (Idk if he dies or not I haven't read the full series yet but he better not)
27,"Dec 26, 2020",i wish this was a anime serie ‚ô•Ô∏è
27,"Dec 24, 2020","From what I know of Korean History, there is only One Man who could be described as a ""God of Naval Warfare."" In the 1590s, Admiral Yi Sun Shin demolished a Japanese armada of over 160 ships with a mere 11.  There's a great film about it called The Admiral: Roaring Currents"
27,"Dec 24, 2020",He‚Äôs like a big cheat code
27,"Dec 23, 2020",NOBODY TOUCH GILYEONG OR I'M THROWING HANDS
27,"Dec 23, 2020",I wanted to have a peek of what traumatized Dokja as well. 
27,"Dec 23, 2020",OMG DOKJA THAT WAS SO CUTEEE *fangirl gifts 1000 coins*
27,"Dec 23, 2020",MAH POOR SMOL BOI
27,"Dec 23, 2020",Ok I really hope at the end Dokja adopts or becomes like a brother to Gilyeong 
27,"Dec 23, 2020","She killed her closest friend... Woweee. Was not expecting that. She looks cool as heck, though. (Maaaaaybeee we can find out why later, because there were several more girls at that school that she could've used instead.)"

27,"Dec 26, 2020",god I'm so interested at Dokja's personality. I'm scared of him lol 
27,"Dec 23, 2020",He has got literal plot armour. Lol
27,"Dec 23, 2020",I like how Dokja is able to do this super calmly and is able to work with everyone.
27,"Dec 23, 2020","lmao earlier this episode i wanted to protect gilyeong with everything and then i was like ""this new chick is kinda badass"""
27,"Dec 23, 2020",At this point I'd do anything for Gilyeong.
27,"Dec 23, 2020",I would also like to see this made into an anime I would binge watch this and then watch it aging just for fun
27,"Dec 23, 2020",i feel like gilyeong is what‚Äôs going to keep dokja‚Äôs humanity in the end and what he‚Äôll strive to protect
27,"Dec 23, 2020","It‚Äôs funny cause we always think ‚ÄúOho, NOW they are fucked‚Äù then Dokja just goes ‚ÄúLol, u thought, I actually foresaw this coming long ago that‚Äôs why I did that apparently insignificant thing back there u probably don‚Äôt even remember aha, joke is on you, gullible reader‚Äù. Yall, the key is not doubting Dokja, doesn‚Äôt matter how fucked up the situation looks like, boy knows what he is doing."
27,"Dec 23, 2020",AHH I love dokja and baby boy relationship it‚Äôs so cute ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
27,"Nov 4, 2020","Not gonna lie, that is a very scary mental prison. I imagine that if someone had repressed memories from a traumatic event, it would be like having a new trauma all over again... Is anyone else getting a little thrown by the Western naming order?? Trying to ignore it üòÖ"
27,"Nov 4, 2020",Hmmm this constellation was also curious of our characters backstories 
27,"Nov 4, 2020","trying yo get my friends obsessed with this as well, cant be the only one anxiously waiting for the next chapter. also if im going to be poor so are my friends :p "

27,"Apr 28, 2021","guys you won't believe it but I came here to get free coins but now I m in love with this,I think this is one of the best stories in the webtoon!!hats off to author for creating such a story lots of love from india"
27,"Apr 27, 2021",Am so curious but so sad for baby gilyeong whose gone through such hard things üò≠ please protect this poor precious child
27,"Apr 26, 2021","oh my gosh, dokja and gilyoung interactions give me the will to live "
27,"Apr 26, 2021",[Constellation Hona is willing to give up her heart and soul to protect Gilyeong]
27,"Apr 15, 2021",I look at Dokja and Gilyeong as brothers. They‚Äôre cute. üò≠
27,"Apr 1, 2021","No one gonna mention the bitter face dokja had and the words his mom said? It's so sus and that one line he said ""I wonder if my mom is alright, im sure she is cause it's HER after all"" kinda sus I mean he obviously knows not everyone could survive yet he believes she can because of something? The mom also telling him to pretend he didn't see anything is uhh very sus indeed "
27,"Dec 30, 2020",is it just me or does the main scenario seem weirdly specific?
27,"Dec 30, 2020",Up until now Gilyoung has never broken down like that given all the crazy shit he‚Äôs seen. Makes me wonder what he went through in his past to cause that kind of reaction
27,"Dec 29, 2020","petition to make this an animereply below with ""yes"" or ""no"""
27,"Dec 26, 2020",ugh I didnt even realise I caught up. I knew I should've waited longer before reading this
27,"Dec 25, 2020","Gosh I love Dokja and Gilyeong‚Äôs relationship , dokja was considerate towards him and Gilyeong feels he can go to him for support and comfort ."
27,"Dec 24, 2020",I wonder if both Dokja and Gilyeong are both traumatized by their moms so they are drawn togetherü§î
27,"Dec 24, 2020",I want to hug Gilyeong too. :(
27,"Dec 24, 2020","Protect Gilyeong at all cost, if he dies WE RIOT!"
27,"Dec 24, 2020",I can see that that is the girl from the prologue too ü§©ü§© 3 more characters to gooo
27,"Dec 24, 2020","I wish we could‚Äôve seen more of Dokja‚Äôs trauma. It could‚Äôve  been some interesting character development for him, it also could‚Äôve let us see where he‚Äôs draws some of his drive from"
27,"Dec 24, 2020","This is completely beside the point, but do any other girls out there wonder how the hell the ladies manage their times of the month in these dystopian worlds? "
27,"Dec 24, 2020","I'm glad Omniscient Reader has been adapted into a manhwa. I've read the webnovel before but honestly, I can't imagine some parts/scenes well in the novel that's why I'm thankful that they made this into a manhwa! ‚ù§‚ù§ The storyline is great! "
27,"Dec 24, 2020","Yes, I'm also disappointed not to get a peek into Dokja's past"

27,"May 15, 2021",Gilueong was crouching down and covering his head when he was in the illusion. He also kept apologising. I think his mum was abusive
27,"May 14, 2021",Dang she looks almost exactly like Dokja..
27,"May 1, 2021",now i get why dokja spent 10 years reading this... the story is so freaking good
27,"Apr 30, 2021","This is definitely a story where none of the supporting characters have plot armor and they could die at any moment during any episode, so I really hope we get to see Gilyeong turn into a giant mantis taming badass instead of watching him die."
27,"Apr 29, 2021","I find it very interesting that dokja is the real protagonist. even the 'story' already has one, he doesn't even realize that he's the protagonist for every scene he's cleared with his group. "
27,"Apr 27, 2021","Gilyeong baby is so precious, I love him so much... must be protected at all cost üò≠üò≠‚ù§‚ù§"

27,"Dec 23, 2020",I really like the girl with the super bad ass power but my gut tells me that she‚Äôs going to die. Also who the hell kills their best friend? What? I would never! I would rather die! Omg! Also I feel like badass judge girl and new girl that seems sick are going to be my favorites. What suprises me is that we haven‚Äôt met the actual main character yet. But I think he‚Äôs the master that she talked about. At least we met another main character besides crazy dead boy. I think girl power will win this.
27,"Dec 23, 2020","Damn, now I‚Äôm invested into their backstories. "
27,"Dec 23, 2020",Every time Gilyeong hugs Dokja my heart does backflips. He's so preciousü•∞

Idk, this is just a guess anyway..."

27,"Jul 2, 2021","Aaaaw, look at the monk and god of naval warfare greeting each other like old friends. ...you know the odd thing is that I find myself really liking the constellation's personalities even I know that they are basically watching this for sport. Probably because we're all technically in the same boat except we can't really help even if we wanted to. Looks like we met the girl we were introduced to in the first scenario, and possibly the last girl was her best friend. Ouch. Poor kid."
27,"Jun 18, 2021",HOLD UP SANGAH IS DOING ALL THIS IN FLATS?!?!?

I wish him and sangah will go back like before or become the supporting character in the end. Just don't bother Mr. Han. He will not make it as I observe him. Never.

27,"Nov 25, 2021",Yup. Just as I thought. I told you guys she would only just get in the way. You should've dumped her when you still could. Look at her even the child is more useful and helpful and idn't faint even after the mental trauma he got she should be ashamed of herself. You may be able to fight but thats about it you are just Sakura from Naruto as i thought and I'm not even talking about sangah look at her she cant fight but she is still better than her.

27,"Jan 7, 2021","Was a bit disappointed to be honest. OP characters, to me at least, are only interesting when you juxtapose that with OP levels of suffering. The man needs major setbacks for his victories to feel earned."

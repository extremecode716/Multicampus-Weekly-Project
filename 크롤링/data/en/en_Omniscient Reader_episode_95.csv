Episode,Date,Review
95,"Mar 9, 2022",Dokja’s parenting methods are wild 
95,"Mar 9, 2022",Dokja with these kids with the monsters lol
95,"Mar 9, 2022","yuseung is already such a cool character! but she's so OP like Gil I'm scared she's gonna split from the group eventually, even if hes FINALLY BACK WOOOO. and even dokja has to admit the paradox theory was good reason not to read twsa lmfao [Leaky Faucet sponsors 5 coins as cheers for Gils return]"
95,"Mar 9, 2022",YES THE OG BABY IS BACK!!! I knew it when I saw an insect. Kinda cool how both kids talk to monsters basically...just one is specifically able to talk to insect types whereas the other tames monsters. I wonder if they'll get along well or if they'll fight over Dokja🤣
95,"Mar 9, 2022",Now answer the most important question...... Who is your favourite child? 
95,"Mar 9, 2022",Dokja went from being a bachelor to having a wife and two kids. 
95,"Mar 9, 2022",At this rate Dokja is going to need to open an orphanage AND and animal shelter. 😂
95,"Mar 9, 2022",Dokja out here collecting kids like Pokémons 
95,"Mar 9, 2022","I'm explaining Disconnected Film Theory again in hopes that you fully understand it hehe. It's basically like two sides of the same coin, assume Shin Yoosung is the heads and the Catastrophe of Floods is the tails. (1/5)"
95,"Mar 9, 2022",Dokja sometimes doesn’t get enough credit for his ability to grasp and understand situations quickly. He is nothing short of genius even if he knows beforehand the course of events unfolding. I fail to understand the workings of one normal world properly and there he goes waxing sonnets on parallel universes.😅
95,"Mar 9, 2022","dokja: no wonder TWSA was such a flop
dokja voice TWSA may be trash but its
♥️MyTrash♥️"
95,"Mar 9, 2022",A man and his wife with his hoard of over powered children trying to keep the estranged MC uncle doing his thing
95,"Mar 9, 2022","GIL MY LOVELY INSECT BOY, IVE MISSED YOU"
95,"Mar 9, 2022",YES ITS BUG BOY AND INTERNET BOY (I forget their names pls forgive me 🥲)
95,"Mar 9, 2022",Dokja: Dad of kids with monsters.
95,"Mar 9, 2022",Dokja and his Murder Babies 😆 
95,"Mar 9, 2022",can't wait to see a sunfish doing his sunfish things
95,"Mar 9, 2022","LITTLE THOR IS BACK, AND HE HAS SLEEPY NERD WITH HIM! "
95,"Mar 9, 2022",Dokja reuniting with Gilyeong: Sonill like to introduce you to your new sister. Gilyeong and Yuseung with each other:*Growling with malicious intent*. 
95,"Mar 9, 2022",this guy somehow keeps adopting monster-ruling kids
95,"Mar 9, 2022",Let's hope Dokja doesn't play favourites between his monster-taming children
95,"Mar 9, 2022",I CAN'T ACCEPT ALL THE COMMENTS SAYING DOKJA AND SANGAH ARE MARRIED. I WON'T BEND AND RESPECT LMAO
95,"Mar 9, 2022",it's like I'm watching animal planet
95,"Mar 9, 2022",The art this chapter was remarkable. 😭
95,"Mar 9, 2022",Wait a sec... is Dokja Professor Oak?
95,"Mar 9, 2022",Awww Dokja’s other child came to see him too 😭🥰🥰🥰💕
95,"Mar 9, 2022",I wonder who's actually more powerful? The beast tamer or the insect tamer? Both seem to have the same abilities.
95,"Mar 9, 2022",Dang Dokja and Sangah are like parents with Gilyeong and Yunseung. I'm guessing The army guy and The Avatar power woman are like the aunt and uncle.
95,"Apr 14, 2022",//I literally run out of coins....
95,"Mar 9, 2022",I really thought he let himself get bit/lose a leg. Doesn’t it look like 2 giants teeth sink in to his leg in that one panel? That would’ve been a crazy level of commitment (like when he died once to kill the dragon or whatever way earlier on)… but damn if it wouldn’t be impressive.
95,"Mar 9, 2022",THR DOG 😭😭😭😭😭😭
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Damn, there is some serious middle kid syndrome in the comments. Everyone’s talking about the original baby Gilyoung, or the newest baby Yoosung. But no one seems to be paying attention to the middle internet boy that he adopted, beyond as just an after thought. And you know the middle kid syndrome is bad because I DON’T EVEN REMEMBER HIS NAME 😭"
95,"Mar 9, 2022",Dokja in this chapter being both the best dad and the worst dad 
95,"Apr 13, 2022",“Did you finally get milk Dokja?!!”
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Dokja: Hi son, good to see you safe and sound. Meet your new sister and remember no fighting."
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Kim Dokja. A single dad with three kids and three potential wives and a potential husband who's also a single dad trying to win back his ex-girlfriend and wanting to kill the first dude; all living happily together in an apocalyptic world based off of a complicated and infinitely plagiarized e-novel with over 10,000 chapters."
95,"Apr 13, 2022",dokja: I have the perfect way to train kids *straight up dies*
95,"Apr 13, 2022",I miss Lazy Broke Weeb...
95,"Apr 13, 2022",DONGHOON 😭 ~ The WIFI- I mean the kid is back 😭
95,"Mar 9, 2022","the part were she says she's sorry and that she'll protect her puppy got me real hard in the feels, most likely cuz my own dog died some what recently too(car hit him) so I'm happy she over came her trama, hopefully I can too."
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Dokja realizing he forgot about his other kids
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Hey there parents of the apocalypse, can't care for you own children anymore cause theirs plants that'll eat you alive and giant sea dragons? Fret no more! Just give them to Dokja Kim! (at least I think that's his last name) His parenting methods will help your child ride those sea dragons and even giant praying mantis's. So call now at ***-***-**** to give up your child and for the low price of 50 coins![Not responsible for the death of any children of the mentioned monsters and any others]"
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Dokja's bug child meets the gamer child and they together meet animal child is what I gained from the last panel
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Son #1 and son #2 has joined the party
95,"Apr 13, 2022",dokja and his kids 
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Dudes legit raising a family, hes practically got 3 kids"
95,"Apr 13, 2022","She's standing on its eyeball??  I don't care what level its taming skill is, I'm not letting an inch-sized critter stand on MY eyeball!"
95,"Mar 9, 2022","Did I understood correctly? Since they did not kill yuseung, even if Dokja is her ""constellation"", then the spliced film or the future will not be affected. Meaning the catastrophe will still happen?"
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Gilyeong 🤗
95,"Apr 13, 2022",dokja with kids are wholesome 😆
95,"Apr 13, 2022",dokja's kids unite 
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Not dokja being a dad to 3 children 😭🥺
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Dokja's real attribute: Child Magnet
95,"Apr 13, 2022",I'm crying 😭 The part where she said she'll protect her puppy next time
95,"Mar 9, 2022",so devastated that i cant screenshot like bro i jus wanna share the cool parts i'm not tryna pirate shit 😭😭😭
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Yuseung said: Get on losers, we're sailing"
95,"Apr 13, 2022",nobody absolutely no one: Dokja: we can cross that sea of Sea monsters just fine
95,"Apr 13, 2022","""Gyarados used Surf!"""
95,"Mar 9, 2022",The familie is gathering 
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Bro I swear, if the two kids start getting jealous of the other imma flip a table-"
95,"Apr 13, 2022",GLAD TO SEE THAT OUR INSECT BOI IS DOIN GOOD
95,"Apr 13, 2022",can't wait to see if those two children get along with each other. also their arguements about who dokja likes😆
95,"Apr 13, 2022",the beast tamer meets the bug tamer Lol
95,"Apr 13, 2022",That was a pretty impressive gambit by our favorite unsponsored incarnation. It's hard to make a fight look close like that. I hope manipulating her to grow faster doesn't come back to bite us in the rear.
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Dokja really Batman lmfao shows up with a new orphan every other arc 
95,"Apr 13, 2022",People seem to not even notice Donghoon lmao
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Our bois Gil and Han are back!
95,"Apr 13, 2022",GILYEONG MY BB BOY HOW WE’VE MISSED YOU
95,"Apr 13, 2022",MY CHILD IS BAAAACK HUHUHUHUHU
95,"Apr 13, 2022","YES MY BABIES GILYOUNG AND DONGHOON! OUR INTERNET BABY WITH INSECT BABY IS TOO MUCH FOR ME!!!! Side Note: I wonder how Gilyoung and Yuseung will get along and work together, or if they fight over Dojka"
95,"Apr 13, 2022",just gonna say the disconnect film theory is very important in later parts of this series 
95,"Mar 10, 2022","I have a feeling that the boy will be the new catastrophe that replaces the girl in the future. In the earlier chapters you can see he looks a little unhinged. Plus he also tamed beasts, bugs specifically. "
95,"Apr 17, 2022","Dokja will be like ""Hey I got you a sister, hope you don't mind""
""This is my son, he tames insects""
""This is my daughter, she tames beast""
""They're very scary but they're my kids and I love them a lot"""
95,"Apr 17, 2022",why does that boy look like Sung Jinwoo from Solo-leveling??
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Damn, Dokja should start a daycare"
95,"Apr 13, 2022",i have feeling dokja will be a reason of battle between gilyeong and  yuseung 🤭
95,"Apr 13, 2022",what's w dokja raising kids capable of destroying an entire town
95,"Apr 13, 2022",i think dokja's real power is not omniscient reader but actualy picking up kids and raise them to be the strongest ones in there 
95,"Apr 13, 2022",hello comment section.
95,"Apr 13, 2022",GILYEONG MA BBY I MISS YOU
95,"Apr 13, 2022",DOKJA’S BOYFIE AND FIRSTBORN ARE BACK
95,"Apr 13, 2022","okay but um the last panel, they're cute lol"
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Yeiiii my boy is back, i miss him. (soooo Dokja is a babysitter? nice)"
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Yoo Jonghyuk: I’m a God. //Han Sooyoung: You yelled “shut up” at a thunderstorm and it happened to dissipate. It was purely coincidence. You have no power. //
Kim Dokja: shut up. he’s a God."
95,"Apr 13, 2022","“Come in mister, it’s going to give us a ride”Oh yeah sure, just a casual day in the apocalypse riding the sea dragon queen hm mhm yeah"
95,"Apr 13, 2022","I am kind of irritated, it uses Mister instead of Ajusshi. Sure it is similar but not entirely the same. Ajusshi is a respectful way of referring to an older middle age man or uncle figure. She uses this not only to be respectful but because she sees Dokja as a uncle figure and someone to confined in. This will be an issue as the story continues if she keeps using mister so hopefully they change it soon"
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Dokja has reunited with all of his adopted kids now
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Father Dokja ✔️✔️✔️
95,"Apr 13, 2022",GILYEONG I MISSED YOU SWEET CHILD!!!
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Now Dokja's kids will meet.  :)

95,"Apr 13, 2022",Ohh Gilyeong how much I missed you 
95,"Apr 13, 2022",So one is the king of beasts and the other is the king of insects.
95,"Apr 13, 2022","[the god of 🖤 ships 🖤 is currently thinking of pairing the two children, but is stopping himself, but is thinking of it, but is stopping himself, please pray to it for strength to resist]"
95,"Apr 19, 2022",Dokja the single mother
95,"Apr 17, 2022",I literally binged read this whole series (it was on my recommended).
95,"Apr 14, 2022","I am not afraid of long books, but TSWA would not have been my cup of tea. Imagine all this stuff crammed into text without any visualisation. Then imagine a whole compendium of skills and artifacts and constellations and monsters and whatnot. And our boy Dokja remembers it all... Today I can't recall 60% of the character names of the stories I've read..."
95,"Apr 13, 2022","GILYEOUNG!!! YAY, DOKJA'S ADOPTED FAMILY IS FINALLY BACK TOGETHER!"
95,"Apr 13, 2022",WOO HOO MY BABY BOY AND MY INTERNET BOY

95,"Apr 13, 2022",i binged this yesterday and a new ep comes out. maybe i am god
95,"Apr 13, 2022","One water type Pokémon trainer,  one bug type trainer. But Dokja trains trainers."
95,"Apr 13, 2022","If I had a nickel for every time Dokja collected a scary powerful child that can talk to monsters, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice-"
95,"Apr 13, 2022","That was a bit manipulative of him, but it looks like it was needed for her to break through her own mental blockages."
95,"Apr 13, 2022",all of his kids
95,"Apr 13, 2022","when yoosung apologized to her dog, i teared up a bit"
95,"Apr 13, 2022",teaching kids to train monsters.....do you want pokemon????? Because thats how you get pokemon.....
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Gilyeong! Meet your sister ~ Don't fight! 
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Dokja: It's about the ✨drama✨ 

AND GILYEONG's BACK ! Can't wait to see how he and Yuseung interact especially bc both kids seem to admire Dokja. And that they can both be pretty terrifying too"
95,"Apr 13, 2022",I’m so glad she came to understand her trauma instead of letting it hold her back. She’s just a child and she did what she had to to survive. 
95,"Apr 13, 2022",the second i saw the praying mantis I KNEW
95,"Apr 13, 2022",The fact she couldn't protect her puppy kills me 😭😭
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Dokja is the type of parent to take his kid fishing at the triangle just for a life lesson.
95,"Apr 13, 2022",So…. Is this all the  kids he took under reunion?
95,"Apr 13, 2022",insects and beasts... there's gonna be one hell of a fight if they don't like each other
95,"Apr 13, 2022",HAHAHSHSHAHAHAH he has three children now
95,"Apr 13, 2022",so in love with Dokja and his army of wholesome but terrifyingly powerful murderous small children
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Asian parenting by Dokja
95,"Mar 11, 2022","So, as far as I understand, the disconnected film theory states that by joining the two realitys in this particular way, the existence of the people from this realitys gets entangled but nothing more, therefore the only thing you can affect is their deaths. "
95,"May 18, 2022",Dokja's sons meet his daughter
95,"May 7, 2022",lmao not dokja being a dad of three 😭
95,"Apr 19, 2022",i have caught up to this im sad i want more!! this series is amazing i finished it in one day ahaha

95,"Apr 15, 2022","*me who finish reading orv novel that want to spoil but at the same time don't want to*
*FOURTH WALL IS SHAKING*
*FOURTH WALL HAS NULLIFIED THE EXCITEMENT*"
95,"Apr 15, 2022",GILYOUNG AND DONGHOON!! we need more of this duo 😭😭
95,"Apr 15, 2022","I wish they would use Korean way of addressing, like ajhussi and ssi instead of mister, it sounds so out of place n doesn't bring the same emotions to their bond imo "
95,"Apr 15, 2022","It’s cute how Dokja thinks he’s manipulating these kids, meanwhile they took one look at this skinny man who needs a nap and decided that 1. he was their new dad, and 2. that he needs to be taken care of."
95,"Apr 14, 2022",Kid 1 meets kid 2
95,"Apr 14, 2022",Now now look at all those gifted kids and if i was there i'm pretty sure all i had and could do was screaming
95,"Apr 13, 2022","it's interesting how much of a gray area dokja is willing to enter to live. he's essentially using yuseng by exploiting her feelings to unleash her power, which is a smart move, but is very much using her feelings for his own benefit."
95,"Apr 13, 2022",I missed Gil so much 😭😭😭
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Let the  sibling rivalry begin.
95,"Apr 13, 2022",We finally have all the kids together

95,"Apr 13, 2022",MY BABY HES BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
95,"Apr 13, 2022",please tell me that was an erased reference 
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Dokja the baby sitter
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Ahhh im gonna murder you, how dare you, I finally see my fav child and you leave it off there ahhhhhh"
95,"Apr 13, 2022","AHHHAHHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHA LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO HE""S BACK!!!!! READING AT WORK ON MY PC (CALL ME A TERRIBLE EMPLOYEE IDC) AND I JUMPED OUT MY CHAIR ALMOST CLAPPING! I was literally thinking while reading ""man i really miss the rest of the gang"", then giant praying mantis shows up. Now, where da hell is my Huiwon???"
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Does it mean if namjoon had killed yesung, no catastrophe of floods would have happened. And does it also mean that if that happened junghyuk would have not faced catastrophe of floods in that particular regression? "
95,"Apr 13, 2022",when one of the original party members pull up with a big mantis

95,"Apr 13, 2022",BRO THEY ARE SO CUTE THE 3 CAN BE FRIENDS
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Our lovely Sangah understanding this puzzling theory is just... amazing. I mean... thanks to the comment section, and Natsumi/I am now dead (bc i guess they're the same) i think i understand it. but it quite confusing."
95,"Apr 13, 2022","dokja get kids that can bring him pets, one are insects the other is everything else lmao"

95,"Apr 13, 2022",where is the LazyBrokeWeeb at? I haven't seen their comments lately 
95,"Apr 13, 2022",People tend to be told that they read too many webnovels. Dokja's probably been told that he reads one webnovel too much heheh.
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Yay family reunion just hoping that in the time that Dokja has been away that Gil hasn't become a raging psychopath...
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Very simple, it's just like Spiderman.if in the original story Spiderman dies due to spider bite then the other films and comics would not exist."
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Dokja collects super powerful kids like they're pokemon
95,"Apr 9, 2022","I took a screenshot about the theory because I wanted to keep that in my gallery and then the pop up message spook me like if I just gained a virus so then I deleted it. And that’s how I met your mother, I was on a bug and everything."

95,"Apr 13, 2022",my girl just tamed the queen instead of mere monsters
95,"Aug 6, 2022","ok I think I know who the author of TWSA is, it's none other than Matpat! But remember kids, it's all just a theory. A FILM THEORY"
95,"Jul 17, 2022",All 3 of Dokja's adoptive children have finally gathered in one place

95,"Apr 13, 2022","Dokja not killing Yuseung, meaning she will be still be the catastrophe of flood in the future right, except that she is now an incarnation raised by Dokja. Does this mean the other catastrophe of floods (Yuseung from the future in Film 41) will not appear? Since it is a totally different film. They are not saying that they know which film will be spliced to which. It is just a theory of one film story not able to another another film story."
95,"Apr 13, 2022",NATSUMI_I YOU HOLD THE FORT.
95,"Apr 13, 2022",I hope the author of TWSA didn't read Dokja mind about hearing his story becoming a flop I think he wouldnt like that 
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Dokja epithet should be “father of lords”. Every one of his adopted children is a monster tamer. 
95,"Apr 13, 2022","kindda wanna have a size comparison between the queen and the praying mantis.. (I'm sure the queen beats it, but wanna see by how much o-o). On another note.. I hope Yuseung gets another pupper at some point during the story (not after everything is over)"
95,"Apr 13, 2022",YES FINALLY HE SEES HIS BESTIEEEEE
95,"Apr 13, 2022",So Dokja now knows/has kids that can command giant creatures. Nice👍
95,"Apr 13, 2022","who the other kid? son of bugs, daughter of monsters/beasts. step son is what type of ruler??"
95,"Apr 13, 2022","The last time we saw Gil- wasn't he about to control that bug ""hero"" lady that was controlling(?) Wolf ""hero"" dude-"
95,"Apr 13, 2022",dokja's other kid has returned how will his children react to each other
95,"Apr 13, 2022",GILYEOUNG 😭😭😭😭😭
95,"Apr 13, 2022",one step closer to gilsung interactions! andd one step closer to pain (and donuts)
95,"Apr 13, 2022",omg all his kids are here <3 so nice to see them again
95,"Apr 13, 2022",THE KIDS ARE BACK
95,"Apr 13, 2022",WELCOME BACK GIL! I'VE MISSED YOU! 😭💖
95,"Apr 13, 2022","I've missed ur head bashing, Gilyoung...😌"
95,"Apr 13, 2022","one, two, three, four, five, six, seven you make me feel like eleven"
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Dokja popping off with the faith-dexterity build
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Yessss!!! My king of insects is back!!;
95,"Apr 13, 2022",I actually got a theory. What if Dokja unknowingly changed the catastrophe already? What if the catastrophe is no longer the girl but is instead the boy as he is having just as much growth as the girl but without the aid of dokja.
95,"Apr 13, 2022","whats funny is (spoiler of this episode) when she tamed the queen, i was just thinking back about the kid who tames insects and thought ""yo, what if they meet and train or something"" and then the last panel shows up lmao"
95,"Apr 13, 2022",So he has the insect king or whatever he is and the beast lord. This is gonna be exciting 
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Imagine the two kids had to fight beast vs beast. When they get older, of course."
95,"Apr 13, 2022",They’re back!! Let’s go!!
95,"Apr 13, 2022",GILYEONGGG our babyyyyy I've missed youuu so badddd!!!!😭😭
95,"Apr 13, 2022","I can't wait to see Yuseung and Gilyeong interact. Will they get along and become best friends or will they start fighting over Dokja? I can imagine them going ""hE's mY dAd"""
95,"Apr 13, 2022",GILYEONG! AND INTERNET KID! (Can someone remind me what his name is?)
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Sooo anyone else think dokja best dad 
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Dang, the team is piecing back together"
95,"Apr 13, 2022",Wait who takes priority when it comes to controlling monsters the boy with control over insects or the girl who can control anything or does it depend on skill levels.
95,"Apr 13, 2022","Aiming for this type of detailed world building and characters!The film theory is such a cool spin on multiple timelines though,, "
95,"Apr 13, 2022",kdj collecting op kids😂😂

95,"Mar 9, 2022",Why does using your powers always relate to a nose bleed

95,"Mar 9, 2022",FIRST HAHAHAH
95,2 days ago,yooooooo! this theory gave me a mad idea. what if secretive plotter is actually dokja who's already created his fables and gone down his own path. he wants to see how another surviving dokja can do on hisnrun. it would make sense why he's been interested since the beginning then too. or maybe I'm spewing rubbish lol. just thought it was a cool theory
95,2 days ago,"So, Dokja has 3 kids now."
95,3 days ago,Dokja has all his kids back now
95,4 days ago,why do all the children have beast-wrangling powers
95,4 days ago,All these powerful ladies are 🤤🔥
95,6 days ago,I ship yuseung with gilyoung
95,"Oct 10, 2022",Kids in twsa love monsters as pets 
95,"Sep 29, 2022",But that's just a theory....a Film Theory! XDbtw I love this webtoon :)
95,"Sep 25, 2022",since dokjas two child's can tame or control beast wouldn't they do well together an it so happens that it is a boy and a girl
95,"Sep 22, 2022",I get the impression that Gil is the actual catastrophe...
95,"Sep 21, 2022",Shipping the blonde kid with the brown-haired kid. 
95,"Sep 19, 2022",so no one is shipping insect boy and mammal girl?
95,"Sep 18, 2022",image us being tamed by bees.... or maybe smth of a size of a cockroach... bet the sea monsters feel the same....
95,"Sep 14, 2022",wow one kid controls giant bugs and the other giant beasts
95,"Sep 12, 2022",Is it just me but do I feel like Sangah is the author of TWSA even though its kinda obvious she isn't 
95,"Sep 4, 2022",Man they sure are hyping the shit out of the 5th catastrophe.
95,"Aug 23, 2022","What is with Dokja adopting kids that manipulate animals and on top of that, large asf animals+ kids who experienced trauma and became a lil psychotic like what they are now 💀. But now that I think about it Dokja was also a traumad child, a bit psychotic and suicidal one that is. Does he see himself in them–? Cliche protag move XD. Anyways the adopted siblings finally met, chaos will soon unfold. "
95,"Aug 21, 2022",Dokja and his op child army he’s like Charles xavier I lowkey like the black hair chick better 😢

Hope he and Donghoon become besties :3 But also, I kind of understand kdj’s motives and fair for him to try and get an ending he wants (let’s hope it’s good aligned) but DAMN that was ruthless.

95,"Jul 30, 2022","But it’s just a theory, a FILM THEORY "
95,"Jul 23, 2022","IMO killing a dog would likely be more traumatic than killing a human, the humans understand that this world is kill or be killed, so it's easier to rationalize murder. But a dog does not, and would therefore never think to harm its friend. I can only imagine Yuseung's pain."

95,"Apr 16, 2022","if he saves yuseung preventing her from being the catastrophy I bet gil will become it in her place. so even if he succeeds in saving her and giving the protagonist (forget his name for the time being) a happy ending, then he will take it's place and be mourning as he faces his own catastrophy (Gil). basically dokja would replace (junseok yu I think I'm remembering his name now probably wrong tho knowing my luck) and Gil would replace yuseung. just my personal theory so far."

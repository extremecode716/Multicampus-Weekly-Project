Episode,Date,Review
103,"May 4, 2022","It's so funny how Dokja's companions rushed to him and Joonghyuk's just there on the side, no one even cared for the dude lol"
103,"May 4, 2022",Well it does say to defeat the catastrophe. It never said you had to kill it. I guess she can tag along
103,"May 4, 2022",NO TOO SHORT IT WAS JUST GETTING GOOD
103,"May 4, 2022",wait if joonghyuk was there the whole time does that mean that he saw dokja naked and just didnt say anything till he finished getting dressed 🤣💀 edit: spelling error
103,"May 4, 2022","Guess you're feeling pretty silly now about how you acted after Dokja died, aren't you Mr. Regressor? 👀"
103,"May 4, 2022","Thinking about the fact that Yoo Joonghyuk watched Dokja reincarnate, saw the treasure trove of the sea, stared at him, and only spoke up after he almost finished putting on his clothes."
103,"May 5, 2022","I can't get over Joonghyuk's face, its screams ""why the f*ck didn't you tell me you had a revival skill"", like he's legitimately furious that he was worried over dokja for nothing"
103,"May 4, 2022","Dokja really saying “hmmm… I could, but I’m going for that 100%, perfect, true good ending, soooooooo-“"
103,"May 4, 2022",Don’t let all this cool art and Dokja comforting the catastrophe distract you from that fact that she just ripped her her whole arm off while getting Dokja out of her head
103,"May 4, 2022",THIS NEEDS AN ANIME RN
103,"May 4, 2022","[Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" is glad to see that Dokja is adopting yet another child. 5coins have been sponsored.]"
103,"May 4, 2022",Love everyone coming to dokja when they see him😊
103,"May 4, 2022","THE CATASTROPHE'S HAIR BECAME WHITE, SORCERY"
103,"May 4, 2022","Im intrigued by the little message that popped up when dokja revived, that said “The constellation that likes to change genders is dissapointed by your decision” meaning either that that constellation would have revived Dokja but genderswapped, or that Dokja can change his sex, and maybe other physical traits when he revives if he wants to"
103,"May 4, 2022","It's normal that Junghyeok reacted that way, because I mean he saw him die, if you care about that person, of course you're gonna get mad or crazy if that person dies in front of you... Also I like that no one pay attention to him... Just Dokja 🤣🤣🤣"
103,"May 4, 2022",I wonder if Dokja is gonna help her up. she looks like she could use a hand 😂
103,"May 4, 2022",nah imagine thinking one of your friends died and the next there alive with no clothes on
103,"May 4, 2022","The scenario does say “defeat,” not “kill” :0"
103,"May 4, 2022",Lol the guys running the scenario are not gonna like this but this is what makes Dokja so cool
103,"May 4, 2022","wasn't it supposed to be ""you did well"" in place of ""welcome"" ? 🤔"
103,"Jun 8, 2022",imagine pouring your heart out when your homie just died only to realize he came back to life
103,"Jun 8, 2022","Dokja: Look, I know this may seem sudden, but I actually adopted her like a week ago. I can't kill my own daughter, guys."
103,"May 4, 2022",that panel where dokja hold 41st shin yuseung and present shin yuseung hands to act as a memory bridge 😭😭 major big brother vibe my heart
103,"Jun 8, 2022","""Dokja, take the Ruler's Throne!"" ""No."" ""Dokja, Kill the Catastrophe!"" ""No."" man is just refusing to play by their rules. "
103,"May 4, 2022",I cant wait till the next one I'm so excited 
103,"May 4, 2022",so how is it this man got a brand new shirt after losing half of it 5 episodes before.......🤨🤔🤨 that's not adding up.

I thank thee from the deepest bottom of my very own heart for this gorgeous, stunning, attractive, wonderful, extraordinary, elegant, beautiful, delightful, resplendent, exquisite, ravishing, alluring, heavenly, picturesque, pulchritudinous panel of Kim Dokja naked. 🛐🛐"
103,"Jun 8, 2022","Everyone: DOKJA!!! / Junghyeok, as he collapses to the ground: I'm fine too."
103,"May 4, 2022","Oh thank god, I was so worried he’d kill catastrophe Yuseung and end up killing lil Yuseung. I wonder what will happen though, it would be strange for the two to coexist"
103,"Jun 8, 2022",At least this time Dokja won’t have to take anyone else’s pants 
103,"Jun 8, 2022","YJH: I can't believe you're alived. I got mad for you, I grieved for you, and you're just here aliveKDJ: Why do you sound as if you WANT me to die -_-"
103,"May 4, 2022",Love how everybody dogpiled Dokja while Joonghyuk only has one person. Yuseung has no idea who this is and why they matter so much. Can't wait for this scene to continue next chspter.
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Lmao every week is Dokja making a more insane announcement than the last 💀
103,"Jun 8, 2022",HE SAW THE DOKJUSSY FOR HIMSELF
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Warning: Incoming sadness and rage in the next few chapters.
103,"May 7, 2022",Pretty sure joonghyuk is embarassed how he acted when he thought Dokja died🤭😏man wants to kill him again out of embarrassment XD
103,"Jun 8, 2022", I love how he's like I'm acting out of character and I'm just like bro you literally changed the whole course of the story and you think your acting out of character now??
103,"Jun 3, 2022","God, Joonghyuk's face when he realizes Dokja just came back to life is the best. His eyes are PINPRICKS"
103,"May 5, 2022","conditions and instructions for star stream scenarios: exists // kdj, literally doing the opposite thing every. single. time: no i don't think i will"
103,"May 4, 2022","i would pay double for the next chapter right now, these cliffhangers are killer"
103,"May 4, 2022",he's going to act as Joonghyuk from a previous regression and have her as a companion while she is both older and younger. 
103,"Jun 8, 2022",The gender bender constellation was disappointed because Dokja didnt stay in the body of the catastrophe. lmao
103,"May 4, 2022",idk bout yall but my favorite part is [a constellation who likes to change genders is disappointed by your decision]
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Every time dokja uses the immortal king ability I just think this line “did you think killing me would make me die?”
103,"May 4, 2022",LMAOOOO THEY DREW YJH'S REACTION PERFECTLY.......I LOVE IT THANK YOU
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Watch joonghyuk act like he wasn't losing his mind when dokja died minutes ago lmao

103,"Jun 8, 2022",are you ready to be emotionally devastated by this arc besties!!!!!!!!!! also if i see another fucking harem comment i will kill
103,"Jun 8, 2022",I love that all of the is happening essentially because Dokja wants a different ending to the story he read😂

103,"Jun 8, 2022",[screenshots out the panel of the squad rushing to kim dokja after he revives and photoshops han suyeong in and prints it out and frames it and puts it on the wall of my room] FOUND FAMILY FOUND FAMILY FOUND FAMILY FOUND FAMILY FOUND FAMILY FO
103,"Jun 8, 2022","aaaah i love Yoo Joonghyuk's expression when he sees Kim Dokja alive and getting dressed in front of him. At first glance, you'd think that he's mad that he's alive, but if you look closer, he's actually trembling. Poor man just watched his Companion die before his eyes, because of something he COULD have prevented, now he's clearly alive and well. Of course he's shocked! But i don't think there's any real anger there. Our beloved Ice-Cold Handsome Regressor just has Permanent Murder Face <3<3"
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Nakedja
103,"Jun 8, 2022","To be fair, the quest is to DEFEAT the catastrophe, not kill her, so it may be that befriending her is an acceptable outcome"
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Meanwhile Huiwon chilling with her new sword.
103,"Jun 9, 2022","if this was DnD, Dokja might as well be the bard lmao"
103,"May 11, 2022",Dokja's power has surpassed that of the scenarios. No way there aren't any consequences for that. 
103,"Jun 8, 2022","Lazy Broke Weeb, where are you?! Please come back to us soon! We miss you!"
103,"Jun 8, 2022","Joongkyuk's literally like ""I mourned you, I cried for you"""
103,"Jun 8, 2022",I was waiting for Junghyuk's reaction after Dokja's resurrection !! Lol his face was worth it! 
103,"Jun 8, 2022","""a constellation who likes to change genders is disappointed by your decision"" ummm... what? "
103,"Jun 8, 2022",✨Junghyeok Yu's confused rage  intensifies✨
103,"Jun 8, 2022",I’m not ready for the first Angst of this painful Journey 
103,"May 5, 2022",Man each chapter is getting better than the last
103,"May 4, 2022",THAT PANEL OF DOKJA HOLDING BOTH SHIN YOOSUNG'S HANDS IS BREATHTAKING
103,"Jun 8, 2022","I still can't get used to yoo joonghyuk calling Kim dokja only ""dokja"" because it sounds... too intimate and slightly out of character lol especially in the early chapter"
103,"Jun 8, 2022",I'm tired. Good night everyone. Good night comment section.
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Imagine not reading over 400 chapters already and then reading it in manhwa form at the same time.
103,"Jun 8, 2022","""Beech, you can revive??? I waste my sadness for you!!"" - Junghyuk, probably"
103,"Jun 8, 2022","Okay, I might have come to this conclusion a bit late, but Dokja is like, the opposite of Joonghyuk.... The only thing I can think of that they have in common is that they're both, in a way, suicidal..."
103,"Jun 9, 2022","dokja saying he's acting ""out of character"" everytime he does something nice (which happens to be pretty often)... i need him to know that he's one of the most compassionate people ever "
103,"Jun 8, 2022",all LN readers knows what's next 🤜🤜🤜🤜🤡🤛🤛🤛🤛
103,"Jun 13, 2022","lol everyone is literally Dokja's Companion. They literally rushed to him when they see him and were like ""Get out of the way Junghyeok"""
103,"Jun 12, 2022",DOKJA FLASHED HIS EVERYTHING TO YJH SGAHHAHAHAHA
103,"Jun 9, 2022","These surprise adoptions are getting a bit out of hand, Dokja"
103,"Jun 9, 2022","""Your bodily wastes have been excreted..."" such comic relief 😅"
103,"Jun 8, 2022","Wow I see a lot of usernames representing our ""Omniscient reader"" webtoon.. why am I so glad ಥ‿ಥ"
103,"Jun 8, 2022","I’m sure the big, bad gangsta dokebbi(yes, i probably spelled it wrong) isn’t gonna like that "
103,"Jun 8, 2022",It's good that it's launch week! broke people can also fast pass! yay👍
103,"Jun 8, 2022",THE ART WAS SO FUCKING GOOD THIS CHAPTER BROOO i love how they showed the disconnected film theory
103,"Jun 8, 2022","He was planning this all along, yet I feel that the universe is going to say no to him this time.  "
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Junghyeok Yu getting mad that Dokja isn't dead... so funny man.
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Lolll they really exposed that he pooped himself
103,"May 25, 2022",>>Dokja added Yuseung to the group chat<<
103,"May 4, 2022",bro this webtoon is next level
103,"May 4, 2022",The fact that my Dokja literally became the main character of the novel has me SCREAMING!!! 
103,"Jun 9, 2022","""A Constellation Who Likes To Change Genders Is Disappointed In Your Decision""......bruh"
103,"Jun 9, 2022",the more I m hooked the more chapters gets shorter
103,"Jun 9, 2022",Just dokja sticking to his fable in which no one dies in vain... 😌🤩💜... ✨he gives such ... good human vibes✨
103,"Jun 8, 2022",I'm rereading this chapter over and over again to fill the void in my heart waiting for the next chapter...... painful as it is I must stay strong cause I'm broke as hell 💔💔
103,"Jun 8, 2022",i slammed my hand onto a table when it ended on a cliffhanger (spoiler alert my hand hurts) 
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Just pointing out Joonhyuk saw Dokja naked the whole time and didn’t say anything until he got dressed 🙈 dokhyuk is canon 
103,"Jun 8, 2022",dokja's shirt doesn't seem to have the hole in it now.... sorcery I suppose? 💀
103,"Jun 8, 2022",I mean... Yeah... Jungyeok SAW him 👁👄👁
103,"Jun 8, 2022","Junghyeok's face when he realised Dokja came back to life 💀 all that mourning for nothing. Also everyone holding on to Dokja was really touching 🤧 and I can never predict what Dokja is gonna do next, my man just brings the unexpected "
103,"Jun 8, 2022","Joonghyuk face was hilarious when he saw Dokja, "" how dare you toy with my feelings you little punk, I'm going to kill you"" hahaha"
103,"Jun 8, 2022","Please tell me he’s about to add a catastrophe to his crew, what a mad lad, absolute super stud. "
103,"Jun 8, 2022",If she does end up joining him I wonder what that means for the Dokebbi and the rules
103,"Jun 8, 2022",This series is so well written. This is story telling at its finest. 
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Junghyeok was there the WHOLE time and saw Dokjussy but never said anything until he was finished dressing up. He didn't wanna bother him XD
103,"Jun 8, 2022",you can bet that Dokja and Junghyeok are never speaking of that moment when Dokja revived butt naked in front of him again hahaha
103,"Jun 8, 2022","disaster shin yoosung is turning good and kim dokja will probably manipulate the scenario but the ""Something That Cannot Be Changed"" makes me have some bad feelings yk"
103,"Jun 8, 2022","aaaaaa ""Mister"" doesn't have quite the same feel as ""ahjussi"""
103,"Jun 8, 2022",okay so joonghyuks seen dokjas naked body? 🗿
103,"Jun 8, 2022","Oh boi, I started tearing up towards the end. ""Welcome"". Why did I just realize that nobody greeted her when they woke her up, not even Junghyeok, tho he knew her already? He just jumped straight to what he wanted so ofc she felt used again. This Yuseung needs someone to be on her side even more than the younger one "
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Yjh's face when he saw Dokja 😂😂😂
103,"Jun 8, 2022",The fact Kim Dokja spawned in naked in front of Yu Joonghyuk✋💀 Bet Joonghyuk felt helpless nd guilty when he made a mistake then KD jumped in nd 🪦. Plus it was the first time he saw KD 🪦 in-front of him. I’m pretty sure he felt mad that KD didn’t tell him something because he believes that he is a type of prophet;also when KD switched places with Joonghyuk getting pierced by Yuseong.
103,"Jun 8, 2022","you freaking madman, what next? Go have a drink with the demonlords?"
103,"Jun 3, 2022","Yuseung, you are loved. ❤️"
103,"Jun 1, 2022",lol dokjas hubby (joonghyuk) be mad that dokja died and then came back
103,"Jun 8, 2022",The fact that the angle yjh got was just all 🍑…. The good sir should have spoken sooner
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Butt naked Dokja ಡ ͜ ʖ ಡ
103,"Jun 14, 2022",he saw the dokjussy 
103,"Jun 14, 2022","Man, I binged the entire thing in 3 days, It is too good.I also feel a bit bad,i had the comic bookmarked almost since It was released but i never got to read It until Now :( PD: probably you Will not read this but i love your coments through the entire comic [lazy broke weeb]!"
103,"Jun 12, 2022",Nooo I started reading today why did I catch up already. I waited so long after solo Levelling so I could binge this. I’m sobbing and my day is gonna be boring now
103,"Jun 12, 2022",I'M GETTING JEALOUS OVER S CLASSES THAT I RAISED
103,"Jun 11, 2022",dokja and junghyeoks matching outfits get me everytime 🤣🤣🤣
103,"Jun 11, 2022",was joonghyuk just watching dokjas bare arse for a bit before he started talking 😭
103,"Jun 11, 2022","Wait, Yu Junghyeok was literally in front of him when he was changing and he just spoke up when Kim Dokja was almost done changing?"
103,"Jun 10, 2022","Look, I’d be ready to kill Dokja too if he got a whole new body and STILL chose to steal my fashion style."
103,"Jun 10, 2022",you know i don't think any of us have stopped to think if the ending he wants is a good ending.
103,"Jun 10, 2022","welcome to the series of ""where the heck is pildu""! this is where i'll start commenting ""where the heck is pildu"" every episode till we find him. thanks! "
103,"Jun 9, 2022","Guys I think if Kim Dokja ever chooses a supporting constellation, it’s not going to be Metranon, but rather Secretive Plotter. That’s the only one he doesn’t really know anything about. Plus, the name relates to story plots so it might have something to do with the OG novel"
103,"Jun 9, 2022",I legit forgot about the immortal king attribute. Revived and naked like a new born baby. 😂 
103,"Jun 9, 2022",So when’s the anime coming out??
103,"Jun 9, 2022","What is Dokja planning to do with the catastrophe of flood if he not going to kill her. Although, technically the scenario state that they must defeat the catastrophe, it didn't specified how."
103,"Jun 8, 2022","Haha, おやすみ"
103,"Jun 8, 2022",The constellations watching like: 👁👄👁
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Yeah! Make her you companion! The only trouble is the Dokaebi...I mean... he's the FATHER
103,"Jun 8, 2022","Well.. if he kills her 'King of no kills', won't be his name anymore.. also let's just add another acquaintance.. why not ¯\_ʘ‿ʘ_/¯ she'll be a good frnd too"
103,"Jun 8, 2022",1000! HAPPY NATIONAL NAME YOUR POISON DAY! HAPPY BEST FRIEND DAY! AND HAPPY NATIONAL JELLY FILLED DONUT DAY
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Convenient that the penalty for that is something that literally no one cares about😀
103,"Jun 8, 2022",why was the constelation who like changing gender dissapointed? lol
103,"Jun 8, 2022",I mean. he wouldn't anyway because of the immortal king penalty. 
103,"Jun 8, 2022","""this is what I like to call a little trolling"""
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Is it just me or do these episodes keep getting better and better
103,"Jun 8, 2022",I should stop here and read after 2 months. Maybe by then there will be no more cliffhangers and we will pass this arc already. Waiting to read each new chapter of this arc is truly torture.
103,"Jun 8, 2022",the art surprises me every time. i can't imagine it getting even better just wow
103,"Jun 8, 2022",He’s ahead of Joonghyuk rn and he hasn’t killed a single catastrophe… it’s like playing pacifist in undertale and laughing at all the genocide players who can’t finish the game
103,"Jun 8, 2022","So no ones gonna talk about how silent Joongkyuk was, while Dokja was dressing..."
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Shouldn't Joonghyuk know about the Immortal King ability? it was a secret power or anything 
103,"Jun 8, 2022",Next time on “Dokja Kim say FU to the DM”
103,"Jun 8, 2022","Glad Dokja's not gonna kill the older Yuseung. It doesn't seem like it's with ulterior motives (tho who knows), just that he wants her to live. Also, very convenient his clothes were just there compared to that last time he died"
103,"Jun 8, 2022",The panel where child Yuseung turned and immediately then saw Dokja is my FAV in this chapter. the contrast from her initial colouring of dark and dull eyes then immediately one filled with life and sparkle after she saw him was BEAUTIFUL 😭😭😭😭
103,"Jun 8, 2022",You can see the  emotional damage Dokja put us thru(Junghyeok but also me 🥲) I'm not ready for what's about to come 
103,"Jun 8, 2022",No!! Don't leave me like this! Who does that?! 
103,"Jun 8, 2022",He’s gonna defeat her mentally I bet
103,"Jun 8, 2022","when young yoosung’s eyes lit up with vibrance from seeing dokja alive,,, aaaah so beautiful 🥺💖💖💖💖 I felt the relief "
103,"Jun 8, 2022","""this is one of, if not, the most best series on Wednesday""prove me wrong?"
103,"Jun 8, 2022",notice there that its written to defeat the catastrophe not kill it 
103,"Jun 8, 2022",yjh what does dokja cakes looks like? 👀
103,"Jun 8, 2022","Welp, that ain't gonna go over well."
103,"Jun 8, 2022",I just thought of something. If Dokja’s clothes got destroyed the first time he was revived then does he have underwear? Or did he take some one else’s? I just want to put that out there.
103,"May 7, 2022","I was a fast pass virgin, but im here now so you know what it means. "
103,"May 5, 2022",Happy ending? With the dokebi? Hahahaha. Fight for your happy ending.
103,"May 4, 2022",How is every episode absolutely stellar? I mean WOW 🤩 We makin it rain here spending all my coins on Omniscient Reader 🥰💕

103,"Jun 13, 2022",NOOOO I’VE FINALLY REACHED THE FAST PASS LANE AND I’M BROKE
103,"Jun 13, 2022",YJH MY BOY YOU'VE SEEN EVERYTHING 
103,"Jun 13, 2022",The way he just smiled at Junghyeok as he looked like he was ready to go on a killing spree was just priceless 
103,"Jun 11, 2022","This is so good, I'm now a fan."
103,"Jun 11, 2022","🥲🥲I’ve caught up, this story is amazing bro. The storyline & the characters are everything "
103,"Jun 11, 2022",Ah yes. The novel depression is getting to me again. Ah. How painful
103,"Jun 11, 2022",Re read this whole series in the past 6 hours and it was still epic 
103,"Jun 11, 2022","Wdym by that, who sent what"
103,"Jun 11, 2022",never thought the day would come where I'm jealous of joonghyuk but man had a front raw seat to the best view in the star stream 🍑
103,"Jun 10, 2022",Nobody cares about the ACTUAL main character. Even the catastrophe is confused as to why some random dude is cared more about than the actual MC. But we’ll dokja made everybody love him instead of running rampant killing everybody in his way like his boyfriend there 💀💀
103,"Jun 10, 2022",mmmm those ribs 
103,"Jun 10, 2022",No nipples?
103,"Jun 10, 2022", That it I’m gonna go read the novel
103,"Jun 10, 2022",I admire Dokja’s ability to empathize and save ppl who are flawed. But i think thats really going to backfire on him in the future and cost the team
103,"Jun 9, 2022",hohoho fastpass came into handy for the next episode
103,"Jun 9, 2022","Just saying but the task is to ""Defeat"" not kill... soooooo"
103,"Jun 9, 2022",Awww damn. This was a short one. Yuseung got a piece of younger Yuseung's memories so she at least knows of Dokja's kindness. It's beautiful to see that reflected in the companions that rushed to his side relieved to see him. I wonder how this will affect younger Yuseung who saw how much the alternate version of her suffered. I wonder what Dokja's plan for redemption is. Ahhh what a cliffhanger! 
103,"Jun 9, 2022",I love how Yuseong (the little girl version) has the color return to her eyes when she sees Dokja 
103,"Jun 9, 2022",Did anyone catch that his body got stronger after “excrete bodily wastes”? 💩💩
103,"Jun 9, 2022","I see my coins fall off this cliff, the hangercliff (>.<)~ 💰 adios coins "
103,"Jun 9, 2022",It’s a trick! We know what happens if you kill too powerful of a being! Their patriot God has it out for you.
103,"Jun 9, 2022",Ah. She was defeated without being killed. 
103,"Jun 9, 2022","Bro...was junghyeok just watching dokja get changed? Lmfao 😂😭 we Stan dokja. Look I’m ngl when I say I have literally had dreams about this webtoon. In one I lived in candy land with them and dokja saved mah life, so friggin random ik and now I’m over sharing. I love this gang man 😭"
103,"Jun 9, 2022",the mad man with the galaxy head
103,"Jun 9, 2022",Welcome our dear biyoo.
103,"Jun 9, 2022","omg a constellation that likes to change gender, I didn't know that I was in this comic"
103,"Jun 9, 2022","Is it just me or does catastrophe Yuseung look like she's aging? Like, her hair looks white towards the end of the episode. Or is that just lighting?"
103,"Jun 8, 2022","Please. Don't kill her. Dokja is just so kind, he won't kill her because he knows what she's been through and wants to help her. Please don't kill any of them off 😭😭😭😭"
103,"Jun 8, 2022",I feel like this is a decision that will be difficult for him to justify...to anyone involved.
103,"Jun 8, 2022","I mean...it does just say 'defeat', not necessarily off her 😌"
103,"Jun 8, 2022","in any other survival stories, there are always, ALWAYS some kind of sacrifices, whether sacrifice of a friend, an ally, or a villain who turned out to be good (kind of like the current case, yuseong the catastrophe isn't actually a bad person). if this were any other story, the main character would have killed the catastrophe. but dokja again, is trying his best not to let anyone be killed as a reader. it might seem unrealistic because not everyone can live in an apocalypse, but (contd)"
103,"Jun 8, 2022",I have to wait a week no im dyyyyiiinnnnggg ;_;
103,"Jun 8, 2022",happy pride month to yu- just staring at dokja while he gets dressed- yunghyeok and yu junghyeok only🥰🥺✌

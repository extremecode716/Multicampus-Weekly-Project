Episode,Date,Review
17,"Sep 30, 2020","THE CONSTELLATIONS WEBTOON READERS SMILE AT YOU. [ YOU RECEIVED 5 COINS ] edit1: Nebula is a term used for a group of constellations later in the novel. edit2: of course is 5 coins per constellation, do the math! ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
17,"Sep 30, 2020","Sidequest: ""These guys fuckin' suck, kick their ass for us."" "
17,"Sep 30, 2020",Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt even be surprised if this whole webtoon ends up being the finale of 2020
17,"Sep 30, 2020",damn constellation of the small fries a bit of a kinky b*tch
17,"Sep 30, 2020",You know you are a low-life person qhen your supporting constelation starts giving your oponent gifts for beating you up. 
17,"Sep 30, 2020","For those who didn't get it, those guys implied that they sexually assaulted her"
17,"Sep 30, 2020","[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' is satisfied with your actions.]
[5 coins have been sponsored.]"
17,"Sep 30, 2020",I'm just saying... they didn't show it here but in the novel Dokja tortured the mf. He didn't kill the guy but he freaking tortured him. He targeted the most painful parts of the body like femur etc. There's also blood and flesh everywhere and broken teeth. In the novel there's much more gore shown.
17,"Sep 30, 2020","it never said kill them, they may be pieces of dirt but all he did was break some bones and knock the leader unconscious so he isnt some rouge killing everyone. I appreciate seeing the humanity he still has even with his ability dampening it to keep him alive"
17,"Oct 19, 2020","Fun fact! In the novel, Dokja got the clothes from looting the corpses  ................................................""The first thing I needed was clothes. My outerwear was melted by the ichthyosaur‚Äôs fluids so it was necessary. Of course, there were many of them all around but‚Ä¶ I felt uncomfortable. ‚Ä¶It couldn‚Äôt be helped. I searched some bodies and grabbed clothes that roughly fit. Then I headed to a nearby convenience store."""
17,"Sep 30, 2020","Funny how human nature is depicted here, the despair, the struggle, the satisfaction and desire to be on top while ultimately knowing your own defeat is upon you. It's  sickening yet true. Author I wonder what you've seen and experienced. I am very curious."
17,"Sep 30, 2020",‚ÄúMonarch of the small fries‚Äù Me: mmm delicious! üëå‚ú®üçü
17,"Oct 18, 2020",WEBTOON can we have the 5 day survival forever
17,"Oct 19, 2020",Dokja: There's still someone alive?Me: She's alive cuz she's still wearing a mask üëç
17,"Sep 30, 2020",I'm usually reading romance but this webtoon is just.... I love it
17,"Oct 19, 2020","Oh, some details aren't included in the manhwa huh. I thought I'd see the part where Doka said ""I hope there's no minor constellations watching, because it's adult broadcasting time"" before torturing the mfs :<< THAT PART WAS SO COOOOL"
17,"Sep 30, 2020","If you like this Mc now, just wait lol. This is doing the Webnovel great justice with following the story perfectly, and this art is gorgeous, everything‚Äôs just how I imagined it. Just wait though, it gets *so* much better, stick with it and trust. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
17,"Oct 14, 2020",Call an ambulance! *Pulls out gun* But not for me! 
17,"Sep 30, 2020",I kinda forgot this was how he acted in the beginning lol I used to think he was a bit too cruel but now I just think it‚Äôs adorable. These were much simpler times.
17,"Sep 30, 2020","I love how the constellations all ganged up on the grunts, but now I'm kinda worried about Dokja's state of mind,,,,, he tries to help who he can but at the end of the day he's still killed quite a few people üò• hopefully one day he'll be able to see an apocalypse therapist"
17,"Sep 30, 2020",I don‚Äôt need an anime adaptation if the artwork is this good.... üíØüíØ
17,"Oct 19, 2020","I'm ready to beat the crap out of those dirty men. To those who didn't get it, the woman (won't spoil her name) was sexually assaulted by the men. She was almost raped. Ugh disgusting."
17,"Oct 19, 2020","You have to love how even the Constellations have personalities. I love it, at the very least. Like how the Black Fire Dragon is violent but dull, the Plotter is cunning and how the Prisoner is headstrong and always ready for a fight, and how the Archangel/Demonic Judge is a strong believer in justice."
17,"Oct 14, 2020",even their sponsor knows they are scum
17,"Oct 14, 2020",I'm starting to like these constellations
17,"Oct 19, 2020",PLS DOKJA IS SO HOT WHAT 
17,"Oct 19, 2020",Reading the webtoon then going back and reading the novel chapter that affiliates with it is soo worth it. To just see how things compare. . .the webtoon has done it justice 
17,"Sep 30, 2020",When you‚Äôre already 400 chapters into the light novel but you want to see your thoughts drawn out üòÇ
17,"Oct 19, 2020","Damn she was raped like that? Thats harsh, I wanted comment something about her but now I won‚Äôt. Dokja gave them the energy they deserve, rapist scumbags! "
17,"Sep 30, 2020",All the joy I got from seeing the notification is now gone once I read the last page 
17,"Oct 19, 2020","Dokja really said ""Call an ambulance! but not for me"""
17,"Oct 18, 2020","So seeing how the web novel has 551 chapters, according to my math, it will take 10 years for the webtoon to finish. So that means by that time we'll become omniscient readers too?"
17,"Oct 19, 2020",So... those jerks were abusing the poor woman?üò§üò†
17,"Sep 30, 2020","I love the pacing, I love the action, I love the story, I love the art... Damn I just love it all."
17,"Oct 19, 2020","Ok i just realized, WE are the constellations, WE are watching him for entertainment, except that we are the VIPs that can see things the constellations can‚Äôt see"
17,"Oct 19, 2020",Dokja: What am I? A f*ck*ng scenario magnet?
17,"Oct 19, 2020",At the beginning of this episode i thought he was sucking on a pacifier üòÇüòÇüòÇ
17,"Oct 19, 2020",How do the constellations have more humanity than humans?üò≠they really said ‚Äúkill the pervert‚Äù
17,"Oct 19, 2020","Honestly, I've read the novel, and its never really clarified what they did to her, but basing on some words i've read, I'm leaning on the side that they raped her... its fucking horrible man..."
17,"Oct 19, 2020","kim dokja in a black shirt. that's it, that's the tweet."
17,"Oct 19, 2020","for those who didnt realize what those guys implied... they probably r*ped the women, i think the Korean heavily implied it with how they said that. it's just disgusting, but I thought that this would have gone over my head with how subtle the remark was, so I decided to share it."
17,"Oct 19, 2020","It wasn't that clear in this translation so in case anyone missed it, the ""good"" constellations are angry at the hooligans because they sexually assaulted the woman and left her out to die."
17,"Oct 20, 2020","""How could you be so cold blooded?!"" Says the bastards that molested a woman, left her to die and were about to attempt a mugging and possible double murder. Ooookay."
17,"Oct 19, 2020","dokja: needs new cloths.... Also dokja: GETS ANOTHER BUSINESS SUIT! DUDE, at least something comfortable and easy to move in! "
17,"Oct 19, 2020",I love how the readers are adding the little details that may have been missed from the actual novel. Thank you!
17,"Oct 19, 2020",YOOO GUYS WHAT IF WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE CONSTELLATIONS WATCHING DOKJA
17,"Oct 19, 2020","My mum: don't read it its too violent! What is this going to teach you!? Me: first:english, second: to don't judge a book by his cover and third: DO NEVER underestimate a reader. we are going to take over the world some day.
 My mom:üëÄ"
17,"Oct 19, 2020",I hate people that rape others because they think it's ok at the end of the world
17,"Oct 19, 2020","im so glad this webtoon updates everyday, I couldn't wait a week. "
17,"Oct 19, 2020",Imagine if the Monarch of the Small Fries turned out to be McDonald‚Äôs clown ü§°üçü
17,"Oct 19, 2020",when your such an ass hole even your constilation goes against you
17,"Oct 19, 2020","""Difficulty: F"" God I love small details like this. "
17,"Oct 19, 2020",imagine when this webtoon comes to life and only 35k people know how to survive out of the 7 billion humans
17,"Jun 1, 2021",imagine your constellation gifting the person beating you to death a bunch of coins
17,"Dec 15, 2020",kim dokja: call an ambulance! but not for me üòé
17,"Oct 19, 2020",the woman's conditions in the novel were a lot more graphic and brutal. I'm glad they at least toned it down in the webtoon.
17,"Sep 30, 2020",Someone please invent the time machine so I can go into the future when this is complete. 
17,"Oct 20, 2020",Lol dokja changed clothes from a suit to another suit üëî he classy even when the world is endingü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
17,"Oct 19, 2020","Oh fudge, I didn‚Äôt realize she was sexually assaulted till I looked at the comments... all of them can die, I‚Äôm glad dokja tortured him :("
17,"Sep 30, 2020",I‚Äôm gifting coins like a damn constellation.
17,"Feb 6, 2021",When even your supporting constellations are against nasty rapists
17,"Oct 19, 2020","Remember to always dress your best for the apocalypse, because the mortician ain't gonna do it for you!"
17,"Oct 19, 2020","i thought the thing in his mouth during the start was a pacifier, like i'm confused he's in a convinience store so it is not impossible though hahhahahahalol"
17,"Apr 27, 2021","at first i was just here for the coins but now, im getting fu*king interested. "
17,"Oct 19, 2020","Okay, I have one teensy weensy problem with the webtoon adaptation of this novel. Why is Dokja so attractive here?? He was described in the novel who was not very physically attractive, but damn, this Dokja is fine as hell."
17,"Apr 28, 2021","He really said, ""Call an ambulance... but not for me!"" *pulls out gun*"
17,"Mar 12, 2021","Where is my supporting constellation? Hey, can you also lend me coins?"
17,"Oct 20, 2020","""Monarch of the small-fry"" I'm dyin(‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶)"
17,"Oct 19, 2020",I love seeing Lazy Broke Weeb's comment üòÇ it's a nice way to end the chapter
17,"Oct 19, 2020",I love how pissed off the constellations got
17,"Oct 19, 2020",If you are going to talk about him being cold hearted then what are you a monster?
17,"Apr 29, 2021","I think the author meant to say, ""The Monarch of the Small Fries is a *sadist*"" -- Not a masochist. A masochist derives pleasure from their own pain, while a sadist derives pleasure from causing pain to others. Am I correct?"
17,"Apr 27, 2021",Wait so did no one else think that he was wearing a pacifier at first üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

17,"Oct 19, 2020",One of the many characteristics that I love about Dokja is that he is practical. He wouldn't go soft on people just because and sees through what needs to be done.

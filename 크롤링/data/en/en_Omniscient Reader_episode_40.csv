Episode,Date,Review
40,"Feb 3, 2021","I've sunk so many coins into this series, I might as well be Kim Dokja's sponsor "
40,"Feb 3, 2021","Yo the Hammer of Thor! And GILYEOUNG can hold that shit lol, He is a GOD bless him "
40,"Feb 3, 2021", I knew that kid was gonna be a god!! ...Stop...Hammer time ‚ö°Ô∏èüî®‚ö°Ô∏è‚öí
40,"Feb 4, 2021","For those who are into foreign films, that last one is a historical film: The Admiral: Roaring Currents. It's based off the Japanese invasion of Korea in the 1500s. Admiral Yi Sun Shin was a God of Naval Warfare and managed to defeat a fleet of over 120 Japanese warships with a mere 13.  The Japanese ships were larger and more numerous, but clever use of the tides and tactics allowed him to prevail. Great film."
40,"Feb 3, 2021",Is it just me or is the boy gonna be the strongest character ever? 
40,"Feb 3, 2021","""The constellation, The Secretive Plotter, expresses his distaste for spoilers."" Me, the broke lazy reader agrees. And yes, that includes light novel readers who spoil as well :P"
40,"Feb 3, 2021","A sword known to be the most beautiful out of a collection of five. A shield used by a demigod. A hammer used by a literal GOD. A whole floor with limitless potential on being replicas of insane weapons and armor, YET dokja grabs the MOST ordinary prop: a fukin standard armor suit. [ The broke reader is amused and bewildered. 5 coins has been given ]. Nice choice lol"
40,"Feb 3, 2021",So nobody going to say something about the hat gilyeong picked up? ü§î
40,"Feb 3, 2021","character....real person.... dammit jihye just had to remind him that this was a novel turned reality huh üíÄ let the man clear the scenarios in peace without reminding that this is the world of a novel and almost everybody is a character.also, gilyeong is one strong boi üëÄ"
40,"Feb 4, 2021","""Don't spoil it. They're might be people who haven't seen the movie.""  Kim Dokja Indirectly advising people in this comment section Haha"
40,"Feb 3, 2021","A NINE floor movie theatre??? Well damn, do they show every movie released that month or what?? "
40,"Feb 3, 2021","Ahhh Yes ""The Incredible Huck"" One of Marvels strongest Avengers..."
40,"Feb 3, 2021",YU JOONGHYUK CLEARED INCEPTION AND FINAL DESTINATION BY HIMSELF 
40,"Feb 3, 2021",this years biggest mystery: what did junghyeok see when he saw gilyeong‚Äôs profile 
40,"Feb 3, 2021",I wonder what the hat Gilyeoung took does.
40,"Feb 3, 2021","bro gilyeong is living emboidment of ""Hold my beers"""
40,"Feb 3, 2021","I'm totally agree with the constellation The Secretive Plotter, how distasteful are spoilers. "
40,"Feb 3, 2021",Dokja is the perfect mc
40,"Feb 3, 2021","There you go, Secretive Plotter said it themselves: Spoilers are detestable, don't do it "
40,"Feb 5, 2021",At least they didn't have to deal with John Wick üòÖ
40,"Feb 3, 2021",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' praises the incarnation LGY for being worthy!.] [The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' is also curious on how did the incarnation YJH cleared that movie.] [5 coins have been sponsored.]
40,"Feb 5, 2021",looks like we have Captain America and Thor
40,"Mar 24, 2021","ah yes. I to watch Huck, Johnn and Losers of the Caribbean"
40,"Feb 17, 2021",This regressor straight up killed the hulk and John Wick off screen 
40,"Feb 3, 2021",Is Gilyeong like the secret main character with the most potential? Did he just continuously die in the train car after each regression in the story so he was never a main character of TWSA? But he‚Äôs actually gonna become (one of) the most strong?? Please???
40,"Feb 3, 2021",Huiwon looks FINE af in that dress holy moly
40,"Feb 3, 2021","I would be worried, but Dokja is basically the best general you could ask for, they gots this!"
40,"Feb 3, 2021",SECRETIVE PLOTTER SHOWS DISTASTE FOR SPOILERS. you little shit. 
40,"Feb 3, 2021",when you use this many coins to get this far in the fast pass there ain't no going back
40,"Feb 3, 2021",I really wish someone could like this pls? I just got surgery for my teeth and it hurts like hell so üòñ
40,"Mar 24, 2021",They're kill a movie character. But they're also characters from twsa. But all of them are ALSO characters from Omniscient Reader. So many layers of meta @_@
40,"Mar 24, 2021",And here I am expecting they'd do the signature pose in Titanic
40,"Mar 25, 2021",Thor: IM STILL WORTHY!!!                                                 A child who controls bugs: b*tch please
40,"Mar 24, 2021","Ah yes, I love watching ‚ÄúLosers of the Caribbean.‚Äù My favorite movie."

40,"Feb 4, 2021","Guy, it‚Äôs the Armor, he‚Äôs wearing the armor in the prologue, which means the first season might end soon üò≠(edit) ight my worries have been lifted thank you all üòó"

40,"Mar 24, 2021",Dokja is hot in those armor omg üò≠
40,"Mar 24, 2021",ok kid now put the mjolnir in a elevator and see if it go up
40,"Mar 24, 2021",This is what Dokja was wearing in the prologue!! 
40,"Feb 3, 2021",could someone give a a list of the name abbreviations? much easier than typing and inevitably misspelling the names
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Ooh is Jihye the general? Make sense since she was chosen by the naval constellation
40,"Mar 24, 2021",How did he beat John Wick!?!?!? that's impossibleüò≠üò≠
40,"Mar 24, 2021","if i ever do cosplay, i choose Dokja in millitary armor as my first character üò¢üòç‚öò *chef's kiss*"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Dokja looks so proud of Gilyeoung for lifting the hammer üòÑ
40,"Mar 24, 2021","So many Easter eggs. Titanic, Pirates of the carribean, John Wick, the Hulk. Its fun looking out for them. Really hope that Easter eggs continue in some form or fashion as the series progress. Maybe funny callbacks to other webtoons could happen. "
40,"Mar 24, 2021","If Dokja sees the people around him as characters I'm just glad that he's somewhat emotionally attached to them coz this story would've been very different if he decided to just ""get rid"" of the ""characters"" he didn't like"
40,"Mar 24, 2021","Btw for those who don‚Äôt know, this movie is The Admiral: Roaring Currents. It‚Äôs about Admiral Yi Sunsin which broke records when it was released. "
40,"Feb 3, 2021",I too agree with the distance of spoilers
40,"Feb 3, 2021",Cliff hangers are ilegal *brings out the legendary chancla*
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Is it just me or do they look like the avengers üòÇ
40,"Mar 17, 2021",Dokja thinking how people see characters as non real people the same way constelations see people and he saw the characters of twsa.
40,"Mar 25, 2021","somehow I got the vibe that those are Not ""replicas"". they are real, because the Cinema master makes them as real as the movies. fun Fact: I Just previously called Gilyeoung the chosen one for fun...now he lifts thors hammer. you made me proud boy"
40,"Mar 24, 2021","an additional skill should've been added too when dokja wore that vest, ""your visuals have been enhanced, you've become hotter and more handsome."" ü§ß"
40,"Mar 27, 2021","I KNEW it was Admiral Yi SunShin and his amazing victory w 13 ships vs the Japanese's 133!! as a korean (young lol) patriot, it makes me really excited to see literally one if not the greatest, most patriotic and brilliant military commanders in media. So much respect to you author. "
40,"Mar 24, 2021","I can‚Äôt wait for the next chapter, Jihye is gonna go offffff. Also, PSA! If you like this story, please be sure to check out the original web novel version of it. There are a lot more details and it really makes the plot line more cohesive. I just finished reading it, and the whole story was so great. It‚Äôs definitely worth your time! Link if anyone‚Äôs interested: https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.webnovel.com/amp/book/12524375106746605"
40,"Mar 24, 2021","All us Avenger fans trying not to remember when Tony, Thor, and Cap America had the discussion of Mj√∂lnir and the elevator!!üòÖüòÇ"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",I love the idea of this ark so much
40,"Feb 3, 2021","I know we on movies right now, but I can help but feel like that book was a Gravity Falls joke"
40,"Mar 25, 2021",I just realized that the movies are yet another layer of fiction‚Äî this is getting out of hand 
40,"Mar 24, 2021",The fantastic Huck
40,"Apr 3, 2021","Imagine having to go through Final Destination AND Inception by yourself? that's crazy...also what do you MEAN ""LOSERS of the Caribbean""?! "
40,"Mar 25, 2021",that movie scene is from an actual history event in South Korea. its known as the battle of myeongnyang. japan vs South Korea.
40,"Mar 24, 2021",OMFG Dokja this new item look... very fine on you üò≥
40,"Mar 24, 2021",even the constellations hate spoilers xD
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Me and Secretive Plotter ü§ù hating spoilers
40,"Mar 24, 2021","Gilyeong, god of thunder"
40,"Mar 24, 2021","lol, what's the movie about? the ship sinks. "
40,"Mar 24, 2021","Lol, I would be glad Inception was already cleared too. Inception is a mind-twisting psychological action movie and you would need a genius IQ to pass it."
40,"Feb 3, 2021","JIHYE TIME TO SHIIIINNNEEEE~‚úß don't worry lass, the seasick usually goes away if you're on the water long enough.... But then you get seasick again when you go on land... Oh well? Uhm. Look at the horizon. That helps. "
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Huiwon looked really pretty in that dress. It's a sincere compliment
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Why does Dokja look so hot in that armor?? Like WHYYY?? AND HOW??
40,"Mar 24, 2021","for anyone who wants to watch the movie they are currently in, the title is: The Admiral Roaring Currents"
40,"Mar 26, 2021",I haven't seen titanic yet so thank you author for blocking the spoiler 
40,"Mar 26, 2021","we just gonna ignore the movie ""LOSERS of the Caribbean""????"
40,"Mar 25, 2021","I, too, wonder how he beat final destination lol..."
40,"Mar 24, 2021","Let‚Äôs be honest here, we‚Äôre all sponsoring the little guy."
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Easily my top 5 favorite WebToon. I'm addicted to the story and can't wait to see where it goes. Fingers crossed it gets adapted to anime in the future
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Pfft all that treasure and Gilyeong picked up a hat- At least he was ~worthy~ of Thor‚Äôs hammer :D
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Imagine having to go against John Wick. üò¨
40,"Mar 24, 2021","Oh Don‚Äôt tell me that Jihye is ‚ÄúSunsin Lee‚Äù. How would she command her crew, if she has seasickness?... This is definitely gonna go wrong."
40,"Mar 24, 2021",The poster: üÖ±Ô∏èirassic Park
40,"Feb 3, 2021",man I love the progression  of the webtoon it makes me so happy that this exists the web novel is so amazing I can't wait to those of you who dont read it get to see some of the future scenarios and the way things work out for our beloved Kim dokja
40,"Feb 3, 2021","So no one is curious about how Yoo Jonghyuk clear Inception? I mean, who did he have to kill to complete that movie? Leonardo deCarpio? "
40,"May 8, 2021","Losers of the Caribbean, Huck, Jonny, This is killing me üòÇ"
40,"Mar 29, 2021","Lol. ""Huck"", ""John Ni"", and ""Loser's of the Caribbean"""
40,"Mar 26, 2021",Dokja be looking fineee
40,"Mar 25, 2021",I‚Äôm not gonna lie... Dokja in that armor hits different
40,"Mar 25, 2021",i love it that dokja is not the ml in titanic...
40,"Mar 24, 2021",H u c k
40,"Jul 18, 2021",Don't forget Losers of the Caribbean. XD
40,"May 18, 2021","When Dokja thought ""just a character... a real person"" it must have been pretty heavy for him, considering technically everyone around him is also ""just a character"" from the comic, yet they are right in front of him, living and breathing like a ""real person"". "
40,"May 7, 2021",GILYEONG LIFTED MJOLNIR WHEW THIS CHILD IS GODSENT
40,"Apr 26, 2021",the amount of references in this chapter is amazing‚ú®
40,"Apr 8, 2021",Are we just going to ignore the ‚ÄòLosers of the Caribbean‚Äô poster? Ok.
40,"Apr 3, 2021","i can't even imagine what a nightmare clearing ""ingception"" must have been omg my brain would have been fried to a crisp"
40,"Mar 29, 2021","Me, not a korean, not knowing what movie that is ü•≤üôÇ"
40,"Mar 25, 2021",THE KID IS WORTHY
40,"Mar 25, 2021","So every constellation is a famous person/myth that we prob know. When Jihye's constellation was mentioned as the god of naval battle, Koreans could probably assume her constellation as sunshin lee cuz hes the most famous naval battle hero in Korea. Thats why a few eps ago, when the guy in chungmuro station called jihye 'little samuri' dokja thought that he would regret that when he finds out jihye's constellation. The Myungryang battle is Lee's most famous battle, thats why dokja is calling jih"
40,"Mar 24, 2021","one of the posters was, losers of the caribbean üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",‚ÄúThen is he the male... BARF ü§Æ ‚Äú LMAAAAAAAO ü§£üíÄüëèüèª
40,"Mar 24, 2021",The child is the chosen one!
40,"Mar 24, 2021","The references are amazing, I love Losers of the Caribbean!"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Why is nobody talking about how süëèeüëèxüëèy Dokja looks in that suit??!?
40,"Mar 24, 2021",*reads losers of the Caribbean* STOP BLOWING HOLES IN MY SHIP!
40,"Mar 24, 2021","fighting destination?? its refer to FINAL DESTINATION?!! WHAT THE HELL, HOW YOO JONGHYUK CAN CLEAR THAT MOVIE?!"
40,"Mar 18, 2021",I like how the author made the mc think about whether the people in the story he‚Äôs living are inanimate characters or living people for which morals matter. 
40,"Feb 4, 2021",are you kidding? i just started this series last night.  it took all my coins lol
40,"Sep 18, 2021","Ahh, yes; Mj√∂lnir, the Hammer that Thor himself needs magical gloves and a strength-boosting belt to lift, lifted by a 9 year old who can talk to fleas. Truly, a situation more classic and refined than a vintage 1882 red wine. "
40,"Jul 31, 2021",*puts on chris hemsworth impression* i‚Äôm still worthy!!!
40,"May 11, 2021","that moment when u, a character from a webtoon, hear a character from a book inside said webtoon call a character from a movie ""not a real person"" and ""just a character"""
40,"Mar 26, 2021",That boy really likes his bludgeon weapon
40,"Mar 26, 2021",This is the same outfit djoka is wearing in the beginning of the series.
40,"Mar 25, 2021","I'm pretty certain that the movie reference on the 6th floor is the 6th sense. It is indeed a thriller with a twist, and the theme of only seeing what you want and have been conditioned to see matches the sharp observation skill that was paired with the movie. It's one of my favorite movies, and really, all the references in here are on point üëå!"
40,"Mar 25, 2021",But all real people are basically just characters in that stream that constellations are watching so what does REAL actually mean anymore? 
40,"Mar 25, 2021",Didn't anyone notice John Wick's Poster
40,"Mar 24, 2021",I want to know what items Jihye got
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Losers Of The CaribbeanüòÜ
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Entertained reader is pleased with the story!!!
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Dokja understands how spoilers feel like. so he stopped her ü§ß
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Dokja be looking good in that outfit üëÄ
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Am I the only one drooling over Dokja‚Äôs new look?
40,"Mar 24, 2021",fingerless gloves üò≥üò≥üò≥
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Of course Gilyeoung is worthy of Mjolnir. There‚Äôs no other person in that group who would be worthy (sorry y‚Äôall lol)
40,"Feb 3, 2021","so we have a mini thorcaptain america
and not 1 but 2 sword users 
might as well be a marvel movie"
40,"Feb 3, 2021","He got the armor from the preview, I wonder if that means that fight scene is going to happen soon? Where dokja is clashing blades with junghyeok. Also i love that little gilyeong is able to weild mjolnor. Makes sense because he is younger and still a lot more pure then the other characters."
40,"Feb 3, 2021","This webtoon is soo addictive, I just can‚Äôt stop!"
40,"Jul 28, 2021",so no one has noticed how it says kulk not hulk and losers of the Caribbean no the pirates of the Caribbean 
40,"May 31, 2021","If someone‚Äôs interested in this movie, its title is The Admiral:Roaring Currents (2014)"
40,"May 2, 2021","So is no one gonna talk about how Gilyeoung was able to wield a Mjolnir? Only a person with a heart of a hero are chosen to wield it, and some chapters ago, he was willing to kill people on behalf of their survival. Maybe the Mjolnir is just different here, and only the person that are ""special"" are able to wield it. Hyeongsung might've been capable of wielding it (I think)"
40,"May 1, 2021","LOL, ""Losers of the Caribbean"""
40,"Apr 28, 2021",Gilyeong is worthy 
40,"Apr 7, 2021",Dokja as Captain America and Gilyeong as Thor. Avengers when?
40,"Apr 6, 2021","""HUCK"""
40,"Mar 31, 2021","That ""Losers of the Caribbean"" poster though üòÇüòÇüòÇ and Heewon and Gilyeong being turned into Jack and Rose from Titanic was ‚úåÔ∏èüëåüòÖ"
40,"Mar 30, 2021",for the John Wick movie did the person have to fight AGAINST the dog loving man himself or what? 
40,"Mar 28, 2021",ooh I thought this cinema arc was just a cool way to incorporate new environments but I see u questioning your existence as a character/person dokja
40,"Mar 28, 2021",it‚Äôs amazing how what jihye said made dokja have some reflection because just as how the people in the theater were characters to them jihye and others are characters to dokja
40,"Mar 26, 2021",Gilyeong is worthy. 
40,"Mar 26, 2021","Oh the irony of Jihyee... ""character"" ""real people""- That's you, Jihyee."
40,"Mar 25, 2021","Jihye being so upset again after loosing Thor's hammer to none other than GilyeongüòÇüòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èAnd, why is Dokja calling Jihye in the last panel? Is he planning to bribe her constellation? Since, he's the naval warfare guy, I guess..... Dude, why is Dokja so unpredictable? I still love him though cause #DokjaistheBestProtagonist"
40,"Mar 25, 2021",I love how the kid doesn‚Äôt even react to being able to lift Thor‚Äôs hammer and just asks if he can take it
40,"Mar 25, 2021",He is worthy!
40,"Mar 25, 2021",HES WORTHY!!!
40,"Mar 25, 2021","""Losers of the Carribbean"" üòÇüòÇWow great movie"
40,"Mar 24, 2021","What was special about the hat, Gilyeoung? And was there not enough items for Jihye to get one or was she just being stubborn and picky? üòÖ"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",I‚Äôm just realizing that this is a fiction-ception lol we are reading a manhwa where dokja is the main character and in the webcomic he reads the others are the characters and tgese characters are inside movies and meet others characters... and dokja is having an identity crisis
40,"Mar 24, 2021",I-... I guess Gilyeoung is the new king of Asgard...
40,"Mar 24, 2021",the general is jihye's sponsor right? the naval warfare god yi sun shin? then she will be the main character of the movie :D
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Gilyeong holding that hammer was such a Peter Parker moment
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Dokja be looking like a snacc with that suit üòèüò≥
40,"Mar 24, 2021","[""Witness of the Endless stories"" is smiling at the characters evolution about to take place]"
40,"Mar 24, 2021",idk if anyone else noticed this but when (idk remember who exactly) killed the villain from titanic it parallels from Dokja bc most of them r ready just characters from a book he's read so he's probably thinking whether or not its ok to kill others especially if they are just fictional villains from a book if you know what I mean
40,"Mar 24, 2021",Secretive Plotter and I have that in common we hate spoilers for movies that have a good horror vibe to it 
40,"Mar 24, 2021",The rise of Admiral Lee Jihye
40,"Mar 24, 2021","Wait- Dokjas vest is the same one he had in the prologue Edit: It is an A grade item, which is second best to my understanding, so it makes sense he wouldn't replace it if it didn't need replacing "
40,"Feb 7, 2021",love how Dokja lowkey picked up armor items because his teammates are more suited for attack.. his natural approach to keep the team in balance is topnotch
40,"Feb 6, 2021",This would be a great time to reread the first episode. There‚Äôs a lot of foreshadowing in that episode about what‚Äôs coming next. Dokja is going to fight Jungheok.
40,"Feb 3, 2021",I am running out of coins. Do you accept doge??
40,"Feb 3, 2021",Gil is FLEXING this chapter. casual w/ the hat and the hammer.„ÄäEyes Waiting for Tuesday Night donates 100 coins to Gilyeoung„Äã
40,"Feb 3, 2021",How does one WIN against John Wick...
40,"Feb 3, 2021", The Battle of Myeongnyang!! I love this movie. The whirlpool better still be part of the plot. I wonder which turtle ship they are on? *hopeful foreshadowing*
40,"Feb 3, 2021",Jihye is one cute boy in the titanic 
40,"Feb 3, 2021","Jihye, naval God constellation, help?"
40,"Oct 4, 2021",YALL DONT UNDERSTAND IM LITERALLY SH!TT!NG TEARS RN I CANT BELIEVE THAT LITTLE BOY WAS ABLE TO PICK UP THE HAMMERüò≠üò≠ AND THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS PRICELESS

40,"Jun 1, 2021",how tf do you even beat final destination
40,"May 7, 2021",[The Late Reader agrees with Secretive Plotter]
40,"May 7, 2021","dude when dokja said ""a character, a real person..."" he was really just talking about how the lines are so blurred for him, huh? bc these people were characters to him"
40,"May 2, 2021",'Losers of the Caribbean' is OP not a fan of pirates???
40,"Apr 28, 2021",Umm why did I think of gravity falls when I saw that book
40,"Apr 28, 2021",birassic parküòÇüòÇ
40,"Apr 27, 2021",I think we all knew gilyeong was gonna be able to pick up that hammer lmaoo
40,"Apr 27, 2021",nobody is gonna comment on how that book is from gravity Falls?? okay üëå
40,"Apr 7, 2021",YOO THIS IS TRIPPY!! They see the movie characters as just characters. Dokja sees them as characters? AND WE SEE THEM AS CHARACTERS!! WTF üò± 
40,"Apr 2, 2021",Our boy is worthy!!  Y‚Äôall got this!
40,"Mar 31, 2021",I think i know who the secretive plotter is i believe that he is the author just think about it he was never itroduced in twtsa according to Dokja and what would the author be doing he could have gone after the protagonist and survived but he's nowhere to be found 
40,"Mar 27, 2021","""Losers of the Caribbean"" lmao i saw thatüòÇ"
40,"Mar 27, 2021","Gonna drop this two points here for the ppl be aware of how the story goes(This is not spoiler though), just to brush it off some expectations.1 - Characters relationships unfolds nice, but is just friendly, like a Scooby Doo show, romance here is non existent so dont expect that (not even a kiss), unless the artist change the source material.
2 - The ending is a open ending, like Bastard or Sweet Home from webtoon. I particularly not like this style.
Still its a great and long story, enjoy it."
40,"Mar 27, 2021",They had no right making Dokja so damn fine üò©üò©‚úã

40,"Apr 26, 2021",One of the reasons why the novel and webtoon are better when you‚Äôre Korean is because there are subtle details which only Koreans or those who lived in Korea would know and it makes the scenes much more meaningful and substantial.

40,"Mar 24, 2021",I think I know why Jungheyuk is deciding to just die now.

40,"Nov 19, 2021","I think there's something going on about Gilyeoung. Either he's just a pretty good, lucky and matured kid. I think he might be a regressor who has only regressed one time. "
40,"Nov 11, 2021",Something off 
40,"Nov 5, 2021","It's rather impressive how they changed the movie names, hulk became huck and pirates of the Caribbean became losers of the Caribbean. LOL"

40,"Oct 28, 2021","The way Gilyeong pulled out the hammer with ease, Style‚ú®"
40,"Oct 28, 2021","I feel like the characters were acting out of their usual personality. It's usually Huiwon who disagrees to killing and Dokja who acts in a cold hearted manner. But in the ship movie, Huiwon was the one to agree with killing the character without any hesitation and Dokja was the one who felt more hesitant. It would have made more sense if Dokja said to kill him and Huiwon tried to stop him or atleast feel hesitant. Maybe it's just because it was a villain that Huiwon didn't feel anything idk."
40,"Oct 22, 2021",did Dokja take the gloves? because then that means he took 3 items not 2
40,"Sep 3, 2021",what the

Look at that~ Also lol Gilyeoung got Thor's hammer, I guess he can get rid of the rat's skull now, it suits him. Guess it chose him since she couldn't pick it up. The school girl's sponsor, it's the god of naval warfare, right? So I wonder if it's her time to shine now~"

40,"Mar 25, 2021","sadly im not a korean, may i ask what movie are they in right now?"
40,"Mar 24, 2021","Am I the only one that gets really annoyed how comics always show characters wielding their shield and scabbard on opposite sides, you dont wield your sword in the same hand as you shield so they are supposed to be worn on the same side to make drawing it quickly possibleEdit: I should mention this is from my own experience training in mock combat with a short sword and shield."
40,"Mar 24, 2021",wew. I think jihyee will be the villain in that movie. goodluck guys

40,"Mar 24, 2021","im curious on how the main character didnt connect the story to his surroundings, imagine reading 600 and sum chapters of something and still not realizing these battles and events are occuring in your areaü§îüòµ"

3,"Aug 19, 2020",What about animals that aren't humans??
3,"Aug 19, 2020","I don't like how they changed ""a reader(dokja) should live the life of a reader"" to ""i live my life my way"""
3,"Aug 19, 2020","Its tinny fingers and paws, its innocent and malicious face,its tinny body!THE DOKKAEBI  WAS SO FRICKING CUTE!  I want it."
3,"Aug 19, 2020","Me on that train: Real life has become a Video Game, this is the moment that I have been waiting for. "
3,"Aug 19, 2020",i imagine the Dokkebai's (is that how you spell it) voice as Monokuma's dubbed voice.
3,"Aug 20, 2020",guys no spoilers . others need to read. and yes this is one hell of a ride that you are entering .
3,"Apr 26, 2021",tip for new readers: NEVER search this up on Pinterest until you're done reading the entire novel. you have been warned.
3,"Dec 15, 2020","When the Dokkaebi went on about the people living privileged lives for free in the novel’s narration Dokja raised an interesting point in the novel’s narration that was left out here “Free? No one in the subway lived for free. The people strived to make money in order to survive, and they rode the subway on the way home from work. Yet at this moment, no one disputed the dokkaebi’s words.”"
3,"Aug 24, 2020","So by the logic of, ""Kill one or more living organisms,"" couldn't someone just pass some hand sanitizer around and clear it easy? I mean, if it kills 99.9% germs... pretty sure you'll kill one at least. "
3,"Sep 13, 2021",*rubs some hand sanitizer* Quest completed.
3,"Feb 24, 2021",kill or be killed taken to another level
3,"Aug 24, 2020","I'd just go kill an ant or something, but they're probably gonna murder each other, aren't they?"
3,"Jul 26, 2021","*Kill one living organism*Me, an intellectual: *Washes hands*"
3,"May 8, 2021",I can assure you that @#%$! is not spanish
3,"Feb 26, 2021","Dokkaebi: This isn't a dream... nor a ""novel""
Me: Yesn't"
3,"Aug 26, 2020",So this is basically “2020 the Novel”? 🤔
3,"Aug 24, 2020",WHY DOES THE DOKKAEBI LOOK ADORABLE EXCUSE YOU?!
3,"Apr 26, 2021","I was just gonna skip through most of the episodes for the coin thing, but I decided not to, this is awesome"
3,"Aug 24, 2020",i came here for the free coins but I am actually enjoying the story. thank goodness I'm greedy 😂
3,"Sep 24, 2021",Mail: kill one or more living organismme: *steps on ant* done!
3,"Dec 13, 2020",Has no one noticed that the end is supposed to be at that start?
3,"Aug 30, 2020","So does that mean we will get 3,149 episodes in this webtoon?😳"
3,"Feb 19, 2021",My question is how tf does this man remembered the exact words of the start of the novel when he read that chapter 10 years ago.
3,"Aug 21, 2020",I'm surprise the mc remembers the phrases of the first chapter that he read 10 years ago. unless he reread the novel (a +3000 chapters novel yikes) 
3,"Aug 20, 2020",*sees dokkaebi cinnamon ver* me fully knowing its evil: dont say it dont say it- i want one

3,"Aug 23, 2020",Anyone gonna talk about the foreshadowing?? The white hair guy smirking??
3,"Aug 20, 2020","FIND A BUG AND KILL IT also does anyone think the dokkaebi is lowkey cute 🥺 like okay it's a scary killing machine thing woo but like my monkey brain just, squeeeoosh 🥺"
3,"Jul 7, 2021",You know like a friggin two horned creature came and is floating in the air and you say: i think it's speaking Spanish
3,"Apr 26, 2021",Im re-reading this again and i just realised that the panel order is a bit messed up. I think the last panel should actually be the first one
3,"Dec 8, 2020",I’m rereading it and for some reason the first page is on the bottom?
3,"Feb 11, 2021",Lol I love how the content warning is at the end 😂😂
3,"Oct 14, 2020",i thought it was a cute little yeti...
3,"Sep 7, 2020",That thing looks like a Digimon 😂
3,"Aug 30, 2020",Soo...to survive I quickly subscribed so I don’t miss an episode...because you never know right😂
3,"Aug 27, 2020","To be fair the prompt said any living organism. If I was on the subway on the way back from the lab I might have a petri dish on me. In that case I'd just walk to the front of the cab and ask the creature to clarify ""Any Living Organism"". When he confirms the statement is correct I'd pull out the petri dish and clarify there are nearly a billion living organisms on said dish before proceeding to pull out a lighter and burning them to death. (1/2)"
3,"Aug 19, 2020","Everyone else would be worried about killing someone else, while I'd be looking for hand sanitizer."
3,"Jul 17, 2022",if dangerous why fluffyyy (the mythical creature)😩
3,"Jan 31, 2022",man just want a reward from the author but the author gave him depression 😔😔😔

3,"Jun 10, 2021","well, i find that creature cute ok"
3,"May 2, 2021",this reminds me of alice in borderland 👀
3,"Apr 27, 2021","Tbh if it were me, I would not have remembered most of the story if I had started reading since middle school. Especially not the second paragraph of the first chapter 😬"
3,"Apr 26, 2021","“Kill one or more living organisms”.... steps on flower, “Tada!” 🤷🏽‍♀️🤓"
3,"Apr 26, 2021",I think the panel order is messed up
3,"Mar 24, 2021",ugly my foot that's the cutest thing ever(✪ω✪)/

3,"Oct 15, 2021",when you only want to read a story that is special for you then this is the author's return gift 🥲
3,"Oct 6, 2021",Totally not me still thinking the dokkaebi looks SOO STINKING ADORABLE even when it was angry.............
3,"Aug 28, 2021",Woah this so cool. Those assignments are no joke! But whoever that grinning man was…he terrifies me…he looked so h a p p y…
3,"Aug 21, 2021","Oy this is free content? Pooing and breathing. What a rip-off. But now they're charging us for that ""privilege"". EA must be behind this scheme. "
3,"Aug 16, 2021","It said ""Kill a living organism..."" Can't you just kill a plant then? Its a living organism (I think,.. (im dumb))"
3,"Aug 6, 2021",This is giving me Alice in Borderland vibes and I love it😀
3,"Aug 3, 2021",Day 2 voicing the characters 
3,"Jul 31, 2021",When I saw the doka whatnot I was like “awe it’s cute!” And then 5 seconds later “ well SHIT”
3,"Jul 19, 2021","I was at first like ""Dokkaebi so cute"" later on ""oh no forget what I said""😂"
3,"Jul 7, 2021","Soooo the ""mission"" first in order to survive is to kill living organisms. So it's not necessary to kill humans. You can kill insects or any other living organisms except humans. So that's why it's graded F. I see. "
3,"May 20, 2021",am i the only one who thinks this dokkaebi is cute??
3,"May 13, 2021",He warned you but NOOOOO no one ever listens to the flying furry demon 
3,"May 13, 2021",Brooo imagine if this were animated tho?? This exciting scene would play out so well ahhh
3,"Apr 29, 2021",couldn't you just give every one some hand sanitizer wich I'm sure some one at least has and once every one has there Hand sanitizer tell them to wipe there hands down on a random surface and bam boom pow you have just killed living organisms germs are organisms that are alive so you could save every one on that train thanks to purell i have just saved every one I am the big thunk 
3,"Apr 28, 2021",I’m so glad I found this again! Definitely one of those series that I would re-read multiple times. The Dokkaeibi is prolly one of me favs cuz he’s very meme-able xD
3,"Apr 27, 2021",Dokkaebi cute until it shots someone's head lol 
3,"Apr 26, 2021",Does bacteria count? *slowly pulls out hand sanitizer* 
3,"Apr 26, 2021",They should put on some hand sanitizer since bacteria are living organisms. They’d be getting a high score if they had some of that kills 99% of bacteria one.
3,"Apr 26, 2021",What if the person writing this actually travelled back in time to tell them about it?
3,"Apr 26, 2021","notice ""living organism"" not ""human"""
3,"Apr 24, 2021",i think the last panel was meant to be after the title panel.. must've been a mix up 
3,"Mar 14, 2021",The first panel was misplaced in the end of the episode
3,"Mar 10, 2021",I don't like how that one guy was smirking when the kill one or more living organisms popped up
3,"Feb 23, 2021",Cute and dangerous. Thank you.
3,"Feb 19, 2021",remember to comment and like every episode so that the artist will help you survive the apocalypse. Thank you for this episode! I look forward to finishing the series

3,"Feb 3, 2021",Soooooo.......  Are we not gonna talk about the guy with white hair SMILING?
3,"Feb 1, 2021",That one loon laughing-
3,"Jan 30, 2021","Judging by the view counts, he doesn't reread chapters, yet he remembers word-for-word the opening lines, even after ten years... This man definitely has a photographic memory."
3,"Jan 30, 2021",when you remember every detail from a chapter of a three-thousand-chapter novel you read ten years ago (￣ヘ￣)
3,"Jan 17, 2021","bro, did anyone see the little him sitting in the background with the bug container?"
3,"Jan 9, 2021","30min to kill some plants or insects, right? You all wouldn't get desperate enough to kill each other?"
3,"Dec 12, 2020",THIS IS SOOOO GOOD!!!!!

3,"Oct 14, 2020",just kill a bacteriakind of logic
3,"Oct 8, 2020",It didn't say human so if i work at a pet shop i could just step on a fish or kill a bug
3,"Sep 28, 2020",I’m sorry but why is the doekkaebi so cute :’) looks like a squishy 
3,"Sep 14, 2020",Pick a flower? That's a living organism 
3,"Sep 3, 2020",Your Free trial on life has ended
3,"Sep 3, 2020",Kill one or more living organisms huh? I'mma kill a bug. That counts right?!
3,"Sep 2, 2020","that dokkaebi was like ""ur free trial of life has expired"""
3,"Sep 1, 2020",My inner fangirl is fangirling too much!!!! That Dokkaebi looks so close to how I imagined it. Terrifyingly cute!!
3,"Aug 30, 2020","dang!!! the dokkaebi is CUTE AF!!!

edit: SAVAGE AF!!! "
3,"Aug 30, 2020","This is very interesting because it seems like an isekai (but it’s still their world), like he went into the novel (but the novel become real), like a killing for fun death game ( but there’s more to it), like an alien invasion that shows you how small your worlds place is in the universe (but there have been no mentions of aliens thus far), like a survive the apocalypse story (which it is),  and like a video game with missions and coins and stuff (but it’s not)."
3,"Aug 29, 2020",I feel like this is what sword art online wanted to be 
3,"Aug 28, 2020",Am I the only one who thinks that this Dokkaebi is kinda cute ? Yes... wellEdit: you know what...Nevermind...
3,"Aug 27, 2020","""kill 1 or more living organisms"" If anyones got some hand sanitizer or isopropyl alcohol on them, this should be an easy task."
3,"Aug 27, 2020",“1 living organism” I immediately thought of the the boy holding the cicadas
3,"Aug 25, 2020",*kills a fly* Okay cool done. 
3,"Aug 25, 2020",That dude smirking is a serial killer. He killed three people for breakfast. What’s three more?
3,"Aug 25, 2020",One living organism not human right? so they could kill a bug. but I have a feeling ppl r gonna end up killing eachother smh
3,"Aug 25, 2020",I think that if you just killed a plant... it will be the same thing as killing an organism ... cause it’s a live
3,"Aug 24, 2020",Me: *sees white fluffy creature* awwww ♡○♡ *it goes insane* •_•
3,"Aug 24, 2020",They could’ve murdered a bug! 
3,"Aug 21, 2020","When i read the dokkaebi's lines, my brain immediately made him sound like monokuma"
3,"Aug 20, 2020",When the dokkaebi first appeared I thought it was kinda cute. Then it went all murdery
3,"Aug 20, 2020",It's starting 2 feel like the hunger games...
3,"Aug 20, 2020",THE DOKKAEBI AHHH SO CUTE IDK CALL ME CRAZY BUT THE DOKKAEBI IS FLIPPING ADORABLE..but kinda scary BUT IDC

3,"Aug 19, 2020",I see white haired boy living his dreams hahaha there’s that smirky excitement 
3,"Aug 19, 2020",This manhwa is amazing! I can't wait for the latter chapters. (p.s. I'm a reader of ORV's webnovel so I know what will happen to Dokja.)
3,"Aug 19, 2020","Bruh, this guy sure makes an interesting story. Kill or be killed, my kinda story.😜"
3,"Aug 11, 2022",I mean.... is it bad that I would just trick myself into thinking it's a VR game and just do the tasks??
3,"Jul 29, 2022",Bruh how has nobody realized bacteria are living organisms yet? JUST GRAB SOME HAND SANITIZER GODDAMN IT!!!
3,"May 12, 2022",Am I the only one who thought that goblin was cute? 
3,"Apr 28, 2022",“It’s not a film or a novel!” I mean isn’t it tho?
3,"Mar 18, 2022","living organisms includes plants, right?"
3,"Feb 28, 2022","i reread this story again while waiting for another episodes to be updated. and to think that i was listening to ""fairytale"" while reading this was (poof) mind blowing. its combination was so cool. 🔥"
3,"Dec 27, 2021",I hope they do realize for this task they technically just need to kill a plant 
3,"Dec 16, 2021",so basically beginning of the series they want everyone to follow thanos' idea. wipe out half the population of the world
3,"Dec 10, 2021","I'm sorry but what the heck is he gonno do with the money, omg. Dumb"
3,"Nov 30, 2021",this is so interesting!! 
3,"Nov 11, 2021",I- this reminds me a little of Alice and border land like the idea that they go against each other !! Love it so far !!
3,"Nov 10, 2021",well that turned dark quickly
3,"Oct 26, 2021",1. that crazy white haired guy looks like he's gonna play an importsnt role 2. living organism? can't you just kill a bug or something?
3,"Sep 23, 2021","so any living thing, so like a cockroach"
3,"Sep 4, 2021","I've absolutely poured over this webtoon and boy. Some of the best art, and writing I've read seriously, top notch and I hope that one day this, dare I say masterpiece gets an animated adaptation."
3,"Aug 19, 2021",okay this is getting REALLY interesting i cant wait to read on
3,"Aug 17, 2021","Hm, what if our white blood cells just happen to kill a virus/bacteria? 🤔🤔"
3,"Aug 15, 2021",i can't believw i was lazy to read this webtoon?!?!! it's an amazing story!!
3,"Aug 10, 2021",Dude remembered the first chapter of his novel that he started to read 10 years ago. I can't even remember what I ate this morning but this dude can remember the first chapter
3,"Jul 15, 2021",It looks totally different than I pictured in my head.
3,"May 23, 2021",Does swallowing semen count? I mean they are a bunch of little organisms.
3,"May 14, 2021","I expected a demon, or some horrifying, terribly scary devil monster, but its just a pomeranian-goat-ditto"
3,"May 2, 2021",A wild white dangerous furrball has appeared!!!
3,"Apr 30, 2021",No need to kill humans. Kill the bacteria in your body.
3,"Apr 28, 2021",This suggests you could just kill an insect?
3,"Apr 28, 2021",wait did anyone notice the smirking guy

3,"Apr 13, 2021",can't they just eat a plant or something? isn't a plant a living organism? 
3,"Mar 4, 2021",it was at this moment i realized how good of a comic this was going to be
3,"Mar 3, 2021","Idk if I'm dumb or not, but the author of Twsa was like TLS or something like that, could that stand of the last survivor? Idk maybe from a different place or someone in the future, oh well😂"

3,"Jun 1, 2021",that creature is so cute 
3,"May 26, 2021","One thing i learned from novels and comics and applicable in real life is : If a person seems deranged and or dangerous, starts to tell you or anyone else what to do while taking control of the situation (like in this one, hijacks the train, or have a weapon) then it's best for you to comply. after making sure of your safety first then you can worry about anything else. Just listen to what the person say, and don't challenge/provoke them in any way."
3,"May 23, 2021",This is going to be a good binge. 
3,"May 13, 2021",Dokkaebi is so cuteeeeee acccckkkkk!!!!!!!!!!

3,"Apr 29, 2021","So they have to kill living organisms, then their best choice would be to find the kid who had a box full of grasshoppers. 😒🙄 Even if their innocent animals their lifespan is short, so it's  best they make use of them. "

3,"Apr 26, 2021","You know when i read the webtoon i was quite surprised with the appearance of the dokkaebi because having read the webnovel, i got the impression that the dokkaebi were like a mix between the tengu from japanese folklore and the goblins from popular culture. "
3,"Apr 26, 2021","How could she say that was ugly , it is soo cute 🥰"
3,"Apr 26, 2021",First thing that came to mind is when he said “kill any living organism” I thought  “bug”

3,"Mar 24, 2021",Spoilers aren't fun. What's fun is when you don't know what's going to happen. It is more fun than knowing what is going to happen before reading.
3,"Feb 27, 2021","So...I read rebirth and I was really attached to that for a few weeks. But then I stumbled upon this series, and fell in love with it right away. I thought it was just because I would get attached to every webtoon series I read. So I skipped through the series, not really paying attention to the panels and speech bubbles for entertainment. When I caught up to ep 35, I had to wait another week for an ep so I looked for more webtoon to read. But after seeing this, no webtoon will ever be as good. "
3,"Feb 17, 2021",everyone so dumb. all you have to do it slap yourself and kill one of the billions of microorganisms living on and in you.
3,"Feb 11, 2021",Wait so all you have to do is grab a plant and turn it to pulp? That’s easy
3,"Feb 7, 2021",Couldnt you satisfy the conditions of the quest by just existing. Your body kills microscopic organisms that enter your body all the time there is no sie requirement on the organism they have to kill
3,"Feb 4, 2021","In its own small way, this webtoon reminds me of “DICE” another amazing webtoon. The way they have tasks are very similar"

3,"Apr 21, 2021","Why does everyone always assume that a movie is being filmed? Like no, visual effects haven't come that far. Even CGI wouldn't look that real so there's no way they're filming a movie"

3,"Aug 28, 2020","It said kill a ""living organism"". That shouldn't be hard...you're in a subway so step on a cockroach or something"
3,"Aug 28, 2020",well... mosquitos are living organisms 🤷 play smart 😂
3,"Aug 28, 2020",might as well kill a plant because plants are organisms...😏
3,"Aug 28, 2020",Am I the only one who thought of rainbow six siege when reading the first panel
3,"Aug 28, 2020","The guy who is smirking surely read the novel before, or it could be that he just can't wait to kill living organisms. "
3,"Aug 27, 2020",he could just pick a flower 
3,"Aug 27, 2020",ngl that dokkaebi is cute enough to be my stuff toy lmao
3,"Aug 27, 2020","every readers nightmare, The PAYWALL"
3,"Aug 27, 2020",what was a rich man doing on train?
3,"Aug 27, 2020","It specified living organism, not specifically human so.... find a bug?"
3,"Aug 27, 2020",uh oh. is it about to get all hunger games in there? 
3,"Aug 27, 2020",CAN WE TALK ABOUT THAT WHITE HAIRED GUY WHO WAS SMIRKING WHEN HE SAW THE FLOATING BOX THINGY
3,"Aug 27, 2020",This comic better not run for 10 years 😅
3,"Aug 27, 2020",Smirk?! Found the sociopath.
3,"Aug 27, 2020",Once I saw the name Dokkaebi I immediately thought of the video game character from R6S. Just me? 👀
3,"Aug 27, 2020","Man, this webtoon ia probably going to be a wild ride. "
3,"Aug 27, 2020",SAO? Anyone?
3,"Aug 27, 2020",I’m excited to meet the guy who snickered
3,"Aug 27, 2020",Kill that kid's cockroaches!
3,"Aug 27, 2020",That’s one terrifying puffball
3,"Aug 27, 2020",KILL A PLANT
3,"Aug 26, 2020",as someone who read the webnovel I must say it sucks if I had known it would get adapted i wouldn't have read it even though I only read like the first 50 chapters I still know too much about this situation
3,"Aug 26, 2020","""Kill one or more living organisms"" *Uses hand gel*"
3,"Aug 26, 2020",I feel like the guy with white hair that we barely saw will be an important character
3,"Aug 26, 2020","When I saw the trailer on YT, I immediately subscribed to this because it reminded me of Solo Leveling."
3,"Aug 26, 2020","Did someone say this was a novel? because if that’s true, i really need to read it!,"
3,"Aug 26, 2020","ooooo they said ""living organism"" so maybe ppl can kill insects or something XD"
3,"Aug 26, 2020",Dokja looks like Kaneki Ken from Tkkyo Ghoul
3,"Aug 26, 2020",omg this rly reminds me of solo leveling
3,"Aug 26, 2020",When I see the word Dokkaebi - reminds me of GONGYOO!!!😂
3,"Aug 26, 2020",this is just awesome
3,"Aug 26, 2020",I don't think I've ever seen something so cute yet so terrifying at the same time 
3,"Aug 26, 2020",WHAT THE FU*K AM I READING 😱
3,"Aug 26, 2020",Gotta hate those paywalls. Right when you see a NYT recipe for Most Delicious Food You've Ever Heard Of  or when you want to live through your commute- PAYWALL.
3,"Aug 26, 2020",I thought the dokkaebi was adorable… but then it blew up people's heads 
3,"Aug 26, 2020",How broad is the first objective? Could people just wash their hands or use hand sanitizer to kill germs? Those are living organisms even if we don't see them.
3,"Aug 26, 2020",Dokkaebi: “This isn’t a dream...or a novel....” Me: Are you sure about that?
3,"Aug 26, 2020",Ooooo he's hot😏🥵
3,"Aug 26, 2020",Is it just me or when the pop up screen came up I low key got DICE vibes?
3,"Aug 26, 2020",“Your free trial of living has expired”
3,"Aug 26, 2020","It says organism, so like any living organism? Like a fly? Or a plant? This WEBTOON looks so good! Can’t wait to read the rest!"

3,"Aug 26, 2020",Is it just me or is the Dokkaebi kinda cute likkeeeeee kinda want me one
3,"Aug 26, 2020",This scares me....
3,"Aug 26, 2020",Soooooo when does this get turned into a movie? This concept is brilliant and original and I'm hooked already. Terrified to think if this were real and also terrified to see what happens to our new main characters. 
3,"Aug 26, 2020",hmm.. plot twist: what if the mc didn't accept the present.. would the story turn out differently? 🤔
3,"Aug 26, 2020","shouldn't we be happy for the fact that we can breath , talk , hear , see and even walk ? perhaps having Wi-fi is even something you should be happy about, add to that you having access to an electronic device to read this webtoon is a great opportunity! "

3,"Aug 25, 2020","this isn't a funny situation but I just imagined someone would just look at the person next to them and break the silence like ""Damn. Guess I gotta kill you."" lol I'd crack up. But ya, this is intense."
3,"Aug 24, 2020",I know that this makes me a bad person but if i were in their situation i will not hesitate to kill

3,"Aug 24, 2020","When Spanish becomes: @&#*^&@, I will be speaking it too xD Anyway, if I had read it like him, I’m sure I wouldn’t know how to change the outcome of this apocalypse start anyway. That fluffy pink Sullivan goblin sure has some high tech. Who else saw that smirking guy then the holopanels appeared? He’s definitely a murderer. The guy across from him looked like Daichi tho so that was cool"
3,"Aug 24, 2020",well so he has to kill something or someone 👀
3,"Aug 24, 2020",This gives me Danganronpa vibes... we even have an alternative of Monokuma... I LOVE IT
3,"Aug 24, 2020",Ok Monokuma jr.
3,"Aug 24, 2020","Eh? Living Organisms..? I don't know what an organism is but, ""Living""? Are they gonna kill each other❓😐"
3,"Aug 24, 2020",why does the art and protagonist remind me of solo leveling lol
3,"Aug 24, 2020","Well, wtf dokkaebi? You should've gave me the checks instead of burning them you adorable little demon! <(*∆ * >  )"
3,"Aug 24, 2020",Wow I was gonna read this anyway but now WEBTOON is offering coins!!!!!!! Best day ever 😇🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
3,"Aug 24, 2020",This really reminds me of Dice like when the whole school was crazy over the dice and would literally try to Pk each other for it I feel like it’s similar to the story 
3,"Aug 24, 2020",I got hunger games vibes 
3,"Aug 24, 2020",When you're playing the protagonist of the live action of the webnovel you read~
3,"Aug 24, 2020","came for the coins, stayed for the plot! Korean webtoons rock!"
3,"Aug 24, 2020",the path 2020 is on rn
3,"Aug 24, 2020",That feel when you're reading a good story but it's not the kind you like and you just want to read something soft but this comic gives you free coins
3,"Aug 24, 2020",*danganronpa music intensifies*
3,"Aug 24, 2020",Ooooo first step of the apocalypse is getting forced into ethical and moral dilemas and turning everyone against eachother... too real... k thanks now I’m addicted  
3,"Aug 24, 2020",This story is superb ...........👌
3,"Aug 24, 2020",this tiny thing reminds me of Monokuma.
3,"Aug 24, 2020","Your immune system kills living organisms all the time, why worry?"
3,"Aug 24, 2020",Luckily I have hand sanitizer in my purse. 😤
3,"Aug 24, 2020",omg this is hilarious to an insane person like me 
3,"Aug 24, 2020",this really is dice... but worse (as in the scenario lol)!!!
3,"Aug 24, 2020",I would probably just step on a plant
3,"Aug 24, 2020",what if this happens i mean it could🤭🥺
3,"Aug 24, 2020",This reminds me of DICE because of the quests and stuff that EVERYONE got.
3,"Aug 24, 2020","When I read ""@&!.@!%"" I thought he was saying ""bad words"" hahaha :( "
3,"Aug 24, 2020",He reminds me of Monokuma
3,"Aug 24, 2020","what I imagine dokkaebi when I read the novel is, a humanoid shape with a suit like any host in a tv..and then I was like, ""how cute...I want one as a plushie..."""
3,"Aug 24, 2020","This is giving me some serious “Solo Levelling” vibes, I love it"
3,"Aug 24, 2020",So...kill a bug then. A bug is a living organism right? They’re not gonna just start killing each other because of that right...? Ah who am I kidding
3,"Aug 24, 2020",I already love this story! Just imagine something like this happens in real life 😱😂😂
3,"Aug 24, 2020",So. Cute. So. Evil. So. Conflicted.
3,"Aug 24, 2020","question, it said living organism, right? so just kill a bug or something :3"

3,"Aug 23, 2020",is this a sneak peak for next month? 
3,"Aug 23, 2020",I'm a little scared to eventually reach the last chapter of this story...
3,"Aug 23, 2020","living organism.look beside and all around me.........easy? omg.the dokkaebi is so furry😍☺Despite it wanting to kill,I wanna at least hug and cuddle it,maybe if it gives me a wish,rather than survive,let me do that"
3,"Aug 23, 2020",How can a cute thing be so evil!?
3,"Aug 23, 2020",lolol i read tteokbeokki at the start
3,"Aug 23, 2020","Damn, the brutality..."
3,"Aug 23, 2020",It’s not a movie... not a dream... not a novel... it’s a webcomic!
3,"Aug 22, 2020","I can't stay mad at him though, he’s just too cute."
3,"Aug 22, 2020",Assassination Subway. Only Anime lovers will understand 
3,"Aug 22, 2020","This just went from interesting to its gonna be fun :))).  Now I wonder, this has a vibe of the king game or death tube but let's See where it lands. Again 3/2 episodes in and I'm enjoying it "
3,"Aug 22, 2020",So I could kill a cockroach as get away with it 😛
3,"Aug 22, 2020",I'd kill a fly or smth. its a living organism right?
3,"Aug 22, 2020",Can’t he kill a bug or smth but I assume it’s going to get more difficult as the missions go on
3,"Aug 22, 2020",wow this thing has such an absurd potencial
3,"Aug 21, 2020",someone go tell him to step on a bug or something
3,"Aug 21, 2020",Wooaahhh ! ♡

3,"Aug 20, 2020","Honestly, this Omniscient Reader  episode itself already has my heart racing, but the comments from the web novel readers are hyping it up so much that I'm absolutely the most excited I've ever been to read a story here since publishing my own story. The hype is real, people! "
3,"Aug 20, 2020",Am I the only one who thinks the the Dokkaebi is cute? I am? Ok edit: I- but- I take it back…
3,"Aug 20, 2020","All I could think of when I saw those menus pop up was ""Emergency quest kill those with Murderous intent, Penalty your heart will stop"""

3,"Aug 20, 2020",Thanks 
3,"Aug 20, 2020",For some reason It reminded me of Bon. (The comics)
3,"Aug 20, 2020","THE PARALLEL: us = the constellations dokkaebi = the writer dokja = the literal characters in the manhwa.
rlly though the constellations' reactions and the idea of giving coins is like so similar to fast pass and our reactions haha"
3,"Aug 20, 2020","if there are any 'Dice' readers here, they know that they've gone through this 'kill or die' situation earlier too ;^p"
3,"Aug 20, 2020",Looks like someone needs a Snicker 🤭 
3,"Aug 20, 2020","technically money has no value beyond even the human civilization, and even time periods can reduce the value of certain currencies"
3,"Aug 20, 2020","And at the end of the comics, there is an add for PayPal 😂🤣"
3,"Aug 20, 2020",I immediately thought that the mc or anyone could kill the cockroaches in the box that the mc saw the lil boi holding.
3,"Aug 20, 2020","They're about to start killing each other,  aren't they?  Even though it says ""living organism"" so anything would do.  People be stupid.  >.<"

3,"Aug 19, 2020",Going to end up like this guy reading this on my way home from work.
3,"Aug 19, 2020",This is reminds me of dice and the gamer because of the blue screen message thing
3,"Aug 19, 2020",The dokkaebi remind me of the Goblin(Gong Yoo)😅
3,"Aug 19, 2020",I hope it's not a 10 year journey that I lose interest in and wind up regretting 3000ish episodes later
3,"Aug 19, 2020","Well, that escalated quickly "
3,"Aug 19, 2020","I just love plot twist with the cute goblin, then it turns to a head blowing monster"

3,"Aug 19, 2020","It said to kill more than one living organism, so technology you can just kill two bugs and be done with it."
3,"Aug 19, 2020","This is gonna be interesting. I wonder if Dokja can change what's going to happen, since he knows generally how the story goes, if he can use that knowledge to change the outcome, or if it'll always end up as predetermined. Man, I'm HOOKED. "

3,"Sep 23, 2020",I would love to be the only reader of this story
3,"Sep 23, 2020",i really like how they kept the original korean names and explained them for people wo wither don’t speak the language or don’t know much about korean mythology. even when the dokkaebi is speaking in the $&@# language you can still see it saying 아 (the letter a) in korean and i’m really happy they didn’t change it just for the translation
3,"Sep 23, 2020",I chose the right day to bring my any farm on the subway

3,"Aug 27, 2020","——————LISTEN UPPPPPPP————————-This mc is AMAZING and VERY sassy. So I’d recommend y’all to give him a voice according to that (it’s pretty tough to decide voices of the characters, especially in a webtoon). Example: Does anyone remember that ROAST? Yoo Sangah: I think it’s speaking Spanish....should I talk to it? Dokja: NO! What are you gonna do huh? Ask it for money? S. A. V. A. G. E."
3,"Aug 27, 2020",That thing is terrifying😰(it's so interesting) 
3,"Aug 27, 2020",The Quest is like Solo Leveling Style 😁😅😅
3,"Aug 27, 2020",Plot twist it’s just him reading the manga and a dream.? Thoughts? Read the second episode and I’m hooked 
3,"Aug 27, 2020",this is just a little like the webtoon Dice
3,"Aug 27, 2020",sheeeeetttttt more more more
3,"Aug 27, 2020","Well now we know who the author of the story was...the contest must've been like ""what kind of apocalypse to send to the humans"" or something"
3,"Aug 27, 2020","am I to expect 3000+ episodes as well, 'cos I'm down for it👍"
3,"Aug 27, 2020",From a 0 to 10 real quick 😳
3,"Aug 27, 2020",ok i think this is good
3,"Aug 27, 2020","this is really good, story and art"

3,"Aug 27, 2020",this last scene gave me Danganronpa vibes 
3,"Aug 27, 2020","I thought I’d give it a shot, but I’m getting major Solo Leveling Warrior vibes. Can’t wait for more episodes!"
3,"Aug 27, 2020","Goblin teference, seriously... Goblin has popped here too after kdrama success? lmaoz... buh this one looks slightly different. xp"
3,"Aug 27, 2020",wow this is too much just for 300 coin kill two person 
3,"Aug 27, 2020",This slaps 
3,"Aug 27, 2020",Solo Leveling Part 2

3,"Aug 27, 2020",are they dumb ants are living organisms they could have killed some bugs
3,"Aug 27, 2020","So, thay have to kill each others?? Nice"

3,"Aug 27, 2020","i love how ""i read the novel"" people need to say it to the world XDSadly nothing like this novel is ever going to happen ahhahaha, so yea people can enjoy a webtoon, even if they don't know its from a novel XD"
3,"Aug 27, 2020",this just turned into danganronpa guys
3,"Aug 27, 2020",That’s one terrifying puffball
3,"Aug 27, 2020",and the saying goes money cant buy everything
3,"Aug 27, 2020",Woah😱
3,"Aug 26, 2020",whoa
3,"Aug 26, 2020",Wait doesn’t non-fiction mean real tho? So that thing which they believed to be a mythical creature makes the story of twsa fiction not non-fiction. I just wanted to point it out because I got confused at first.  The author must have been confused or something of the differences between the two
3,"Aug 26, 2020",i freaking looooveeee this❤❤❤❤❤❤
3,"Aug 26, 2020","A godlike being outside of Space-Time appears and you think you can convince it with a piece of paper that only has value in our own society? That man is literally the definition of someone with no imagination. Not a bad guy, but too much of a closed thinker."
3,"Aug 26, 2020","""Kill on or more living organisms"" *Picks some flowers*"
3,"Aug 26, 2020","Hey so if Dokja didn't read the story or at least the end, would the world not be coming to an end (Or the free subscription won't end as they're stating)? So Dokja is a villain in a way for keeping at it? "
3,"Aug 26, 2020","They could just kill one or two bugs/ants/flies. If there aren't any, they could use hand sanitizer to kill the germs/bacteria living on their skin. If no one has hand sanitizer OR anything of the sort, THEN they'd have no choice but to just slaughter each other. "
3,"Aug 26, 2020","you have become a ""player"" lol "

3,"Aug 24, 2020",you can also read this in mangakakalot....it already has 18 chapters
3,"Aug 24, 2020","If I were able to keep a semblance of a level head in that moment, I would have had so many questions. What constitutes a ""living organism"" that'll count in the point system? people will obviously go for other humans, since the dokkaebi disappeared+ there's no knowledge on how to kill creatures like it, or if they *can* die. but what if I kill an insect? what if it's unintentional, like stepping on it without knowing? is the 300pts for each kill or just for completing the task? if someone dies.."
3,"Aug 24, 2020",PLEASE CAN THIS HAPPEN TO ME?!?!? (The author noticing me part LOLZ XD)
3,"Aug 24, 2020","Uh oh, it's a planet-wide killing game"

3,"Aug 19, 2020","This is so awesome! I’m loving it so far! I like that the mc is quick to catch on, and even though I’m confused about what is happening exactly or what it all means it’s exciting and like I’m just another person on the subway. I’ve got my theories and I can’t wait to see how it plays out. So far it’s reminding me a little of Hitchhikers guide to the Universe where Earth was scheduled for demolition to make way for an intergalactic highway "
3,"Aug 19, 2020",junko enoshima could never 💅
3,"Aug 19, 2020",dokkaebi reminds me of monokuma

3,"Aug 19, 2020",If this was me I would pick a plant or something so I don’t have to kill anyone 
3,"Aug 19, 2020",can it be mosquito? hehe
3,"Aug 19, 2020","I've never read the actual novel/manhwa, but I have a solitary theory that at the end, it's going to be a story too, and we're the readers. Lmao, tbh I don't know; that was spontaneous."
3,"Aug 19, 2020","So far, I'm enjoying this. "
3,"Aug 19, 2020",omg!!! Bihyung is so cute!!! I never pictured him this cute in my head!
3,"Aug 19, 2020",Could they maybe rip up some plants? 😅 
3,"Aug 19, 2020",This is about to turn into the ending sequence of the Kings Man I can feel it 
3,"Aug 19, 2020",im so happy Webtoon decided to pick up Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint! :0
3,"Aug 19, 2020",Ohhh so that's he's prize
3,"Aug 19, 2020",Oh my gosh 😧😦😶😯😧😮 that was insane and shocking. I didn’t expect any of that. 
3,"Aug 19, 2020",bihyung more adorable and sometimes (many times) idiot than other dokkaebi.
3,"Aug 19, 2020",OKAY NO WAIT IT’S ADORABLE IM 🥺
3,"Aug 19, 2020",dokkaebi...i literally just came here after finishing the kdrama ‘goblin’ today ;-;
3,"Aug 19, 2020",AWWW IT’S SO CUTE
3,"Aug 19, 2020",Why is evil so cute ?
3,"Aug 19, 2020",translator using dokkaebi beside imp or goblin to describe them is the best thing. sometimes im confused for other word to describe them
3,"Aug 19, 2020",I like this webtoon
3,"Aug 19, 2020",corona lookin thicc
3,"Aug 19, 2020",🤘🤘
3,"Aug 19, 2020",this is such a good story👍
3,"Aug 19, 2020",I expect to see an interesting story too
3,"Aug 19, 2020",Oh my god! This is my type of story!!! I'm so hooked aaaaa
3,"Aug 19, 2020",I guess you could could say the main character is like Cheese In a Trap. This whole entire situation is kinda UnOrdinary. Let's find of next time if the mc can survive this situation and climb the Tower of God.
3,"Aug 19, 2020",see I would try and cheat the system and kill like plants and bugs and stuff since they are technically living organisms. Big smart🤓
3,"Aug 19, 2020","i definitely do not know what just happened, but SERIOUSLY THIS IS EFFIN AWESOME"
3,"Aug 19, 2020",Bet these task are going to get harder as time goes on 
3,"Aug 19, 2020",Ffs ea
3,"Aug 19, 2020",They must live in a tinyverse or miniverse or microverse or they must be a battery in a oldmans flying car... 
3,"Aug 19, 2020",So could they like....use hand sanitizer and murder a ton of bacteria on their skin?? LOL. There have to be loopholes...it's so much easier to do that than to kill a human!
3,"Aug 19, 2020",ayy murder scene
3,"Aug 19, 2020",cute little Bihyung 😚
3,"Aug 19, 2020",So the Dokkahebi just turned the subway into a battle royale
3,"Aug 19, 2020","that smirk... Dokja's gonna wipe his smirk off, he is deado"
3,"Aug 19, 2020",reminds me of dice
3,"Aug 19, 2020",He looks too similar to our main protagonist in Solo Leveling :/ 
3,"Aug 19, 2020","I was just about saying this reminds me of botoom! but this is so much more I like this, will we be getting over 3,000 chapters too🥺"
3,"Aug 19, 2020",It gets better and better...  You're in for a roller coaster ride yall
3,"Aug 19, 2020",I cant believe that this immaculate novel is finally getting written into a manga. 
3,"Aug 19, 2020","That goblin thing is adorable, even though it just exploded people's heads 🥺"
3,"Aug 19, 2020","Oh I love this kind of story, its very Chaotic to say the least, Think of that One Movie: As the Gods Will
"
3,"Aug 19, 2020","oh god, here it goes again. Mindless killing plot that we've seen million times. Mirai Nikki, BTOOM, Darwin game, deadman wonderland etc. To make it subverts your expectation, the author combines it with isekai vibe. Don't get me wrong, it has potential tho. as long as the plot doesn't executed immaturely and it nails the characters. I just don't want to see harem and psyco girl trope anymore."
3,"Aug 19, 2020",the art style is kinda like solo leveling i like it😍
3,"Aug 19, 2020",I don’t understand? There’s already way more chapters perfectly translated
3,"Aug 19, 2020",its finally here!! still gonna read it early at naver but glad to see the west release
3,"Aug 19, 2020",This is like tower of god and dice put together
3,"Aug 19, 2020","Ok, on another note, people, go to the panel right after that fluffy boi says smth around the lines, ""Life ins't free now is it?"", look at the part with the two people: one a businessman clenching his briefcase or smth, and another boy. That boy next to the businessman in glasses looks pretty cute if you ask me.  Just saying..... even tho he probably won't be a main character......................"
3,"Aug 19, 2020",Tha- that fluffy thing was not what I imagined the dokkaebis to look like
3,"Aug 19, 2020",Lol kill a rat
3,"Aug 19, 2020","Story? Interesting. Art? Fantastic.  
Interested? Peaked. 
Hotel? Trivago."
3,"Aug 19, 2020",the decision to give the dokkaebi teeth like that is so cursed. i love it
3,"Aug 19, 2020","woah, this is awesome. it gives me chills and i still want to read more"
3,"Aug 19, 2020",AFTER WAITING FOR SO LONG....ITS FINALLY HERE!!
3,"Aug 19, 2020",My guess is the MC will kill the bugs.
3,"Aug 19, 2020","Kill one living organism. 
Me an intellectual: kills one of the bugs the kid had on the train. "
3,"Aug 19, 2020",I LIKE THIS!! LIKE A LOT!
3,"Aug 19, 2020","what is too peculiar to be called a fairy, too malicious to be called an angel, and too innocent looking to be called a devil? <wrong answer only>"
3,"Aug 19, 2020",holy cow this is so good!!!
3,"Aug 19, 2020","Ok, I'm sorry for saying this: Solo Leveling Vibes STRONK-"
3,"Aug 19, 2020",For those saying that this is like Solo Leveling — NO you're very wrong. I can assure you that this is not like Solo Leveling at all and even has better world building narrative.
3,"Aug 19, 2020","To all the people trying to spoil this for people who haven’t read it ,your a Karen"
3,"Aug 19, 2020","it's getting more interesting.. and I didn't expect such a cute thing like that will appear, but a gigantic monster instead lol"
3,"Aug 19, 2020",this is y u dont question magic beast that pop up out of no where😔 tsk tsk shame on u little human
3,"Aug 19, 2020",Killl that thing nowwwww
3,"Aug 19, 2020",but he's cute
3,"Aug 19, 2020",that thing was cute at first then.....not
3,"Aug 19, 2020",haha balloon go pop 
3,"Aug 19, 2020",This is reminding me a lil bit of dice
3,"Aug 19, 2020","Y’all better b just pulling grass out of the ground instead of killing animals, they living organisms "
3,"Aug 19, 2020",It has to be solo Leveling vibe. 
3,"Aug 19, 2020",oh gosh this Is really a treasure ... an horror/thriller webtoon really well done absolutely incredible

3,"Aug 19, 2020",Now i’m REALLY hooked
3,"Aug 19, 2020",This guy reminds me of Monokuma from Danganronpa 
3,"Aug 19, 2020","and pls don't compare with solo leveling, it's from the same studio so the artstyle it's almost the same but the stories don't, experience it without thinking that is the same thing or plot and enjoy it (ʃƪ＾3＾）"
3,"Aug 19, 2020",More than one?? I don't think this is the correct translation...
3,"Aug 19, 2020","me: *kills a ant* ""Is I safes?""  🥺"
3,"Aug 19, 2020",who else is getting Birdbox vibes???
3,"Aug 19, 2020","feelin' the vibes of as the gods will, magical girls apocalypse, and a little danganronpa woooooooh now this is what im lookin for"

3,"Aug 19, 2020","I read this on another site and just after a few chapters, I got attached that I even started the novel. I read this and the novel a few months ago. I already finished the novel and all I can say is that this story won't disappoint you. "
3,"Aug 19, 2020",This is so interesting- 
3,"Aug 19, 2020",This went from 0 to 100 real quick

3,"Aug 22, 2020",My first thought at those alerts was SAO 😄
3,"Aug 22, 2020",It says living organism. Doesn’t that mean they can just kill a plant or something? 
3,"Aug 20, 2020",I HAVE A THEORY THAT THE AUTHOR IS THE BOY WHO READ THE WEB NOVEL
3,"Aug 20, 2020",WHAT!? THIS IS SO GOOD!!! 🤩

3,"Aug 19, 2020",It said more than 1 living organism. Could that not be like a bug or a plant or something? 
3,"Aug 19, 2020",YES THANK YOU WEBTOON FOR TRANSLATING THIS
3,"Aug 19, 2020",wait what if the story winning the contest had something to do with it coming to life

3,"Oct 15, 2020","gee, I've never had top comment!"
3,"Sep 3, 2020",I had a feeling that thing wasn’t as cute as it looked... I just started reading another webtoon called Dungeon Reset- and that thing totally reminded me of the rabbit game master- but much much creepier! 😨
3,"Sep 2, 2020",waaaaa... he's so cute
3,"Aug 30, 2020",This feels like solo leveling 
3,"Aug 25, 2020",love this series already...💜✌🏻
3,"Aug 24, 2020",I'm just scrolling through here to get coins.
3,"Aug 21, 2020",Like dice
3,"Aug 21, 2020","Living organism.. then that counts plants and animals, right??"
3,"Aug 20, 2020",Yo solo leveling season 2 looks insane .
3,"Aug 20, 2020","And thus, the subway’s rat problem was solved."
3,"Aug 20, 2020",Is it just me do do I feel solo leveling vibes?
3,"Aug 20, 2020",this web toon is much more successful then noval inside the web toon
3,"Aug 20, 2020","oh god we all saw that white-haired guy who smiled when the objective popped up, right?"
3,"Aug 19, 2020","y did have be cute when i saw u i was like ""oh they dont have to worry its to cute to kill u ''' then i saw blood ""scratch that u have to run"""
3,"Aug 19, 2020","""I thINK iT'S SpeAKIng SpaNISH"""
3,"Aug 19, 2020",Dokkaebii went from 🤗 to 😈 
3,"Aug 19, 2020",that thing somehow reminds me of a furby
3,"Aug 19, 2020","AYYYYYH IT’S MY BOY BIHYUNG, I love this guy!"
3,"Oct 7, 2021","It said ""kill one or more living organisms and you'll get 300 points."" So basically insects also count in living organisms , so they don't have to particularly kill each other , they can just find some small insect or animal and kill it. This would help shed less blood and save more lives."
3,"Sep 4, 2021",hi. is it bl ? I am here from pinterest . but after reading two chapters I don't think it is bl .
3,"Sep 3, 2020",Just kill plants-
3,"Aug 21, 2020","So, washing their hands would probable work"
3,"Aug 19, 2020",I mean he DID warn y’all 😤
3,"May 17, 2022",i imagine dokkaebis voice as Sundrop from fnaf but a bit higher and kinda like monokumas English dub voice if that makes sense
3,"Aug 27, 2021",idk why but i have major sao vibes from this
3,"Aug 26, 2021","[The constellation ""Shadow keeper"" tells all incarnations following this story ""The fun has just begun.""][The constellation ""Shadow keeper"" has sponsored 300 coins.]"
3,"Jul 27, 2021",the creature is kinda cute tho 
3,"Jul 19, 2021","Nice. Is this something like Alice in borderland theme, survival of the fittest? It's interesting ..."
3,"May 31, 2021","Looking back on this chapter Sangah said ""a Dokkaebi"" when she saw him. Could it be she is a reader as well... or just knows about these creatures from Korean mythology"
3,"Apr 29, 2021",that means they're gonna have to kill each other or they'll die... sheeesh
3,"Oct 27, 2020",That kid had crickets. Let me at em.
3,"Oct 17, 2020",This is basically a mixture of Solo Leveling and Tower of God. AND I LOVE IT VERY MUCH. 
3,"Oct 17, 2020",this is alot like tower of god
3,"Sep 4, 2020","Solo leveling vibes. I hope this one ends better than that though, solo leveling was rushed as hell at the end"
3,"Sep 3, 2020",This reminds me of something... can't quite put my dinger on it though... but I recall a story quite similar....
3,"Aug 29, 2020",IM. SO. DOWN. WITH. THIS. STORY. 😍😍😍😍
3,"Aug 25, 2020",love this series already...💜✌🏻
3,"Aug 20, 2020",Well plants are living organisms. Just stomp a couple daisies 
3,"Aug 20, 2020",If you don’t want spoilers then just don’t read the comments at all u idiots 
3,"Aug 20, 2020",this dokkaebi looks like Lo Bo Bia Ren of TOG
3,"Aug 19, 2020",I knew it. It’s from solo leveling.. this would be epic
3,"Aug 19, 2020",bruv... I feel like that girl is gonna die in a way that makes me cri way more than I need to
3,"Aug 19, 2020","already a typo... the mission should read ""kill one or more"" or ""kill another"""
3,"Sep 8, 2022",spoiler the mc dies chapter 5
3,"Dec 22, 2021",Jesus loves you :)
3,"Aug 21, 2020",Just put on some hand sanitizer and kill some bacteria
3,"Aug 22, 2020","spoiler please, I love spoilers!"
3,"Aug 21, 2020","Why does the Dokkabei want peopleto kill each other? If this is being done shouldn't there be tasks to create living things too? (I'm not dirty minded, y'all are dirty minded)"
3,"Jan 14, 2021",The beginning was a little weak but it’s building up pretty nicely
3,"Sep 27, 2020","maybe this is a spo so please don't read it if you don't want to be spoiled.
which character will died and born again as a dokkaebi? I can't remember her."
3,"Aug 27, 2020",bro this is just a copy of the web novel dice

3,"Aug 29, 2020",💋𝐖𝐖𝐖.𝐒𝐄𝐗𝐆𝐎.𝐈𝐍
3,"Dec 13, 2020","I think the writer was inspired by solo leveling, for real tho"
3,"Aug 24, 2020",THIS IS JUST LIKE SWORD ART ONLINE also u guys might think I'm crazy but I would be amazing if this happened because I've seen sword art online so i already know that he is dead ass so i say this is cool I wish i was there😶😶😶😶😶
3,"Aug 30, 2020",💋𝐖𝐖𝐖.𝐒𝐄𝐗𝐆𝐎.𝐈𝐍
3,"Aug 20, 2020","Not to complain.....but the story is like a walking cliché, the MC has always suffer and he is alone in the world without friends or relationships on a corporative job and the girl he likes is far off his league but suddenly it is a complex apocalipsis and he is the only person knows how everything will turn out and he suddenly become the hero who fight the demons conquers the girls earth and give lessons to the greedy corporatives, It is even more cliché and predictable than solo leveling"

70,"Sep 15, 2021","I am proud to say that we have now reached the 69th episode, nice"
70,"Sep 15, 2021","""WHY ARE YOU RUNNING!?"" "
70,"Sep 15, 2021","why is the plagiarist how I imagined every girl who took ‘inspiration’ from what I drew in art class, “they’re not constellations, they’re sponsors!” "
70,"Sep 15, 2021",Jokes on her. Not even Dokja knows his attribute
70,"Sep 15, 2021","""I have a lie detector."" ""I have a bitch detector, and it's going off the charts."" "
70,"Sep 15, 2021",Yooo that suit makes him look Soo classy 👌🏻
70,"Sep 15, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" is weeping for not being able to watch the stream live.] [The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" is glad that the coin farm is now gone and is enjoying the partnership between the incarnation kdj and incarnation hsy.] [5 coins have been sponsored. ]"
70,"Sep 15, 2021",The amount of thirsty comments in this chap... they're not gonna survive in future chapters if Dokja in a suit already made them floored 
70,"Sep 15, 2021","Plagiarizer: says something cool and insparational Everyone: is moved Dokja: yk, that line-- IS PLAGERIZED *chases*"
70,"Sep 15, 2021","what's your attribute? 
uh... reading?"
70,"Sep 15, 2021",call me weird but this is a cute relationship
70,"Sep 15, 2021",dokja is just casually stripping ppl for their clothes LOL
70,"Sep 15, 2021","""What the hell is your attribute?"" That's literally the one question he doesn't know the answer to."
70,"Sep 15, 2021","""Many constellations are frustrated by the sudden ad"" yep we are right there with ya 😅"
70,"Sep 15, 2021",I’m curious to know what’s in those click to expand options
70,"Sep 15, 2021","I appreciate how expressive dokja is in the webtoon. in the novel it seemed he barely had an expressive face seeing how he almost never addressed his emotions. then again, the story was written in a way to make him look like a terrible narrator, so looking at all the things he missed or left out, makes me happy. "
70,"Sep 15, 2021","If you want to read ahead in the novel, this episode ends in the middle of episode 75 (chapter 15) - A Kingless World (5)!"
70,"Sep 15, 2021","""you'll have to pay to read it"" that hit a little close to home "

70,"Sep 15, 2021","Anime, when? "
70,"Oct 20, 2021",I'm honestly creeped out with the covers this November.. 
70,"Sep 15, 2021",What rumours were they spreading about Dokja? Seems very suspicious that she killed him before he explained himself 🧐
70,"Sep 15, 2021","Reading the manhwa when you have finished reading the novel is honestly interesting! It's probably the same as reading the novel many times, but this time it has visuals and I LOVE IT! 
Anyways, I want to point out many things!! First, Kim Dokja in a suit is so sexy!! Also, Anna Croft, I don't particularly like her but she's so pretty!! And lastly, the expressions of the characters are so on point and feels so real, like when KDJ felt lost, my heart clenched huhu LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT EP!"
70,"Sep 15, 2021",i like how she is so confident about the lie detection skill she has no idea how easy it is to manipulate. especially if it is only at lvl 1... 
70,"Sep 15, 2021","Items 4 and 5 on the contract are ""click to expand"".  Dokja trying to sneak some fine print in there."
70,"Sep 15, 2021",Damn plagiarizer getting mad glamour close ups. Tsundere?!
70,"Sep 17, 2021","Dear constellations readers,the story will now go into a slower build up phase, please buckle up and wait patiently as the fifth scenario at the end of this arc will be one hell of a ride (`･∀･)b "
70,"Sep 15, 2021","Saw this WEBTOON, read first 15 chapters. Then next thing I know I read the full LN on Webnovel lol. But back to WEBTOON to keep on supporting and enjoying the visual interpretation. Side note apparently novel is going to be adapted into movies 🙃🔥🔥"

70,"Oct 20, 2021",Spoiler? 'There's no way she could be worried about me'.... *sigh* and so it begins.

70,"Oct 20, 2021","3 options1. He's wearing the other guys underpants.
2. He ISNT wearing underpants.
3. ...He's still wearing his original pair.

I think I'll just assume the fluffy floating goats are nice enough to sell underwear on the shop... right?"
70,"Oct 20, 2021",Han Sooyoung is violent but she's short so it's cute. She's like an agitated hamster.
70,"Sep 15, 2021",Him in that suit has me questioning my sexuality 
70,"Oct 20, 2021",Just an advice to the readers!! people who haven't read the novel shouldn't come here in comments section. it's full of big spoilers!! there are many who already know the full story and deliberately give spoilers here in the name of theories. beware of these innocently acting people if you don't want to spoil the story for yourself🚨🚨🚨
70,"Oct 20, 2021",Ranveer Khan....damn that was funny ngl. A cross between Ranveer Singh and Shar Rukh Khan or Salman Khan

70,"Sep 15, 2021",Dokja looking hot in that attire 🤤
70,"Oct 20, 2021",Ngl that must’ve really hurt for Dokja who never had a good relationship with anyone in his life as a kid and as an adult. And one of the people who he thought he could somewhat call a friend was actually just another asshole
70,"Oct 20, 2021",not the thumbnails 😭😭 creepyy
70,"Sep 15, 2021","Does Dokja even have an attribute? If so, I do not remember. On a side note, Lazy Broke Weeb has not emerged yet."
70,"Oct 20, 2021",OH GOD THE COVERS GOT WORSE

70,"Oct 20, 2021",Kim dokja in a suit is even better than what I imagined from the novel (༎ຶ⌑༎ຶ)
70,"Oct 20, 2021",Dokja doesn’t want no Yu Junghyeok rip-off!
70,"Oct 20, 2021","updates aside , that cover edit is somewhar suitable for dokja !"
70,"Sep 16, 2021",I love how she honestly thinks that a lvl1 lie detector skill will work on Dokja 😂😂😂
70,"Sep 15, 2021","Wow Dokja in a suit. 😳
On another note, people like the plagiarist annoy me. The way they think they can just take someone else’s work really grinds my gears huehue."
70,"Oct 20, 2021",I'm loving his new outfit 😍classy and practical
70,"Oct 20, 2021","that suit is dope af yes, but hilariously the fandom won't be satisfied until that iconic ✨white coat✨ made it into webtoon 😂 when that day comes, I won't be surprised if the whole fandom, especially the novel readers going crazy over it lol"
70,"Oct 20, 2021",the COVER
70,"Nov 17, 2021","1.  Ranveer Khan. Wonder who’s that. 2. What’s in 4,5 click to expand?"
70,"Oct 26, 2021","I cannot express how incredible this Webtoon is. It’s literally SO CLEVER. I’m not one for fantasy, but holy cow I could not put this down. If this had 3000 episodes, I would totally read them all. I also love how immersive the Webtoon is; In a way, I feel like a constellation myself, and I too would love to donate coins if I wasn’t broke."
70,"Oct 21, 2021",Why does Dokja Kim look so good in that suit?! 😤
70,"Oct 21, 2021",My my… tragic backstory alert! And yeah… Sooyoung would BEVER care about Dokja. Yet 😉
70,"Oct 20, 2021",Thinking ab the now naked man dokja stole the suit from 
70,"Oct 20, 2021",dokja and suyeong has this sibling like relationship hahaha suyeong is the feral younger sibling while dokja is the tired older brother hahaha
70,"Oct 20, 2021",Sure the brown suit and gloves do look nice on him but that iconic white long coat will look even better
70,"Oct 20, 2021",Webtoon must be having a blast editing webtoons cover and scaring people like that..
70,"Oct 20, 2021",kdj against various overpowered combat skills: is that really all you’ve got lmao loser; kdj against lie detection: [nervous laughter] im in danger
70,"Oct 20, 2021",when this webtoon is finished some people are really gonna regret 
70,"Oct 20, 2021",‘there’s no way she’d be worried about me’ u can say that for now kdj 😀👍🏻
70,"Oct 20, 2021","wow, dokja looks like a demon in the new thumbnail"
70,"Oct 20, 2021",Ngl I'm a little disappointed they didn't mention the constellation who enjoys harems in the 69th episode😂
70,"Sep 15, 2021","Is it just me or does The Plagiarist look like a female version of Dokja?Feels like a clue, maybe."
70,"Oct 15, 2021",anyone from the free fast pass department?
70,"Oct 25, 2021",an indian name?... seeing an indian character makes me feel really nice cuz I am an Indian too!! Thankyou!!!😊😊
70,"Oct 22, 2021","Even if she's hot, I absolutely hate that plagiarist's personality. She's literally been caught red handed by the guy who read the entirety of the book she plagiarized, and yet, she still won't admit it (why??? youre literally saying ""i changed it"" but wont admit to copying it???) She's like the weird annoying kid in class nobody actually likes but is somehow popular. Hopefully they make her likeably c()cky, rather than just an @sshole with a superiority complex."
70,"Oct 22, 2021","Sponsors, you say? [The constellation ""RAID SHADOW LEGENDS"" looks down upon you]"
70,"Oct 21, 2021","Dokja isn't as unaffected as he thinks. he's just good at disassociating.  Plus, although I haven't read the web novel, I think it was mentioned in earlier chapters that the Reader attribute keeps him a little detached. Still, poor guy, it's more personal this time. "
70,"Oct 20, 2021","Dokja was wrong last ep, the plagiarist is kind of cute."
70,"Oct 20, 2021","As a novel reader, seeing the people in the comment section makes me laugh. It makes me laugh, knowing what the end is like."
70,"Oct 20, 2021",DOKJA BBY ARE YOU GOOD THERE IN THE COVER?????😭😭😭😭
70,"Oct 20, 2021",He just watched one of the closest people in his previous life get decapitated... Dokja are you ok?
70,"Oct 20, 2021","Ahhh why now the covers look very gloomy, yesterday they only had red background and closed eyes now many have no eyes 😵"
70,"Oct 20, 2021","I have respect for the artists. In the novel hsy was actually stripped down when she was captured by the wanderers, I liked that they changed that. or maybe I'm just misremembering"
70,"Oct 20, 2021","Is it just me, or is the art style becoming... better? Like it was amazing before but idk maybe I'm only now really appreciating the art. Remember to like the chapter, the likes on every chapter are steadily going down."
70,"Dec 16, 2021",I am sorry but I just cant stop staring at Dokja in that SUIT!!!
70,"Nov 3, 2021",why do all indian characters in webtoons have the surname Khan??! like yeah ik that Shah Rukh Khan is the most famous Indian but still...there are other surnames too😂😂😅😅😅
70,"Oct 26, 2021","pls my bi self is quaking, hsy kdj and Anna croft looks so fucking prettyYYyyyy"
70,"Oct 23, 2021",but...but the hot robe... 😔😔😔
70,"Oct 23, 2021","I FREAKING love suits, but the black gloves are the cherry on top, it's sending me, it's so hot y'all."
70,"Oct 22, 2021",author nim is so dedicated that only now I realised we only reached 69th chapter... it feels like we've travelled so far... it's because every chapter is so long...thankyou so much author nim
70,"Oct 21, 2021",There's just something about a man in a suit... but where'd he get the gloves tho. Not that I'm complaining ofc. 😌
70,"Oct 21, 2021",I can't wait till we reach chapter 200 or something and I can make a comment like 'Remember when...'
70,"Oct 21, 2021","fucking hell, this is ridiculously good! this manhwa is right up there next to solo leveling in regards to plot and quality. insanely creative and well-executed stuff. didn’t even know this was available on webtoon up until about five minutes ago. you have no idea how stupid i feel.🥲 and if that’s not all, i’ve been discovering a few other comics i’ve been reading elsewhere on here as well. guess i should try to look at things from the bright side… at least i’m eight episodes ahead of y’all…😭"
70,"Oct 21, 2021","Ignoring the fact that it was ripped off of a corpse, DOKJA IN A SUIT. Also hey, mrs plagiarizer, at least he says he wont kill or harm u and will protect u. From dokja, that’s pretty great. But also WAIT NUR HIS INFORMATION IS HIS GREATEST WEAPON I DONT WANT HIM TO HAVE TO SHARE. Also wait what are attributes again-"
70,"Oct 21, 2021",Before we start…ANYBODY ELSE UBER FREAKED BY THESE WEBTOON COVER ARTS WITH THE FRICKING CREEPY FACES??
70,"Oct 21, 2021","FOOL. She didn't expand the fourth and fifth clauses. Rule one of contracts that might be selling your soul, READ EVERYTHING"
70,"Oct 20, 2021","Interesting. But why would she agree without first expanding those subsections. I have a feeling she’s going to come to regret that, or at least be annoyed."
70,"Oct 20, 2021","Those ""click to expand"" are promising 🤣"
70,"Oct 20, 2021",Both Dokja and Soyoung give off such a lone god vibes. I love them
70,"Oct 20, 2021",is it just me or did his sexiness just leveled up!damn those gloves 💘
70,"Oct 20, 2021","Just have to say, Dokja looks good in that suit😗"
70,"Oct 20, 2021",I imagined sooyoung's chin to be smooth and soft instead of the sharp and pointy but those eyebrows are JUST BEAUTIFUL!!
70,"Oct 20, 2021",man i miss his crusty little robe already
70,"Oct 20, 2021","""they're not constellations, they're sponsors!"" dude the constellations literally sponsor the peeps here"
70,"Oct 20, 2021",he finally got another outfit 😍 this one looks SO good on him!!
70,"Oct 20, 2021",I love the webtoon pfp's
70,"Oct 20, 2021",Dokja 1000% put some sneaky parameters in those unexpanded bits of the contract. read the fine print before you sign! 
70,"Oct 20, 2021",Thinking about how many outfit changes Dokja's had... And that part of the plagiarized novel -- I cannot imagine Yu Junghyeok smiling
70,"Oct 20, 2021",kinda spoiler⚠️ THE HINTS ABOUT DOKJAS PAST THAT I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE TILL NOW DOSBDKSBODHSKDB

70,"Oct 21, 2021",ngl the thumbnail looks really cool
70,"Oct 21, 2021",Seeing this conversation after reading the novel brings back emotions. I am looking forward seeing the end of this webtoon and how it will draw the things. 
70,"Oct 20, 2021",It’s not plagiarism as long as you can run fast enough.
70,"Oct 20, 2021","hsy, me and ysa’s dearest wife…HELLO WIFE, LOOKING RATHER FINE I MUST SAY"

70,"Oct 21, 2021",Wait wait. Just to confirm for those who misinterpreted. HSY is the one who said 'Just what the hell is your attribute' in the last panels. Not KDJ.

70,"Oct 20, 2021","Based on what I remember in the novel, KDJ was also impressed with HSY's line since it proves that even without the title of King, people can be moved and inspired with leadership abilities of any person. "
70,"Oct 20, 2021",I think Dokja wrote the original twista
70,"Oct 20, 2021",So the LIAR has lie detector ability
70,"Oct 20, 2021",I'm crying she's so entertaining what the hell
70,"Oct 20, 2021",honestly the contrast of seeing Dokja in his office days vs now... it really is jarring ;-;
70,"Oct 20, 2021",I'm liking her more and more. They work pretty well together despite their arguing. And she keeps agreeing with him like a tsundere lol.

70,"Nov 22, 2021",Dokja in suit. Hot. 
70,"Nov 13, 2021",The last episodes remind me of Thomas Hobbes philosophy. You know the Leviathan. That time was important because the people no longer believed in the king’s power (the revolutions in europe at that time). Instead the power dynamics have shifted. 
70,"Nov 13, 2021",Ranveer Khan ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

70,"Oct 22, 2021","On a serious note though, I think this is the first time we've seen Dokja k!lling humans ruthlessly. Is it just me? 🤔🤔🤔🤔"

Though yeah putting up rare items in the Auction like that is a good last minuet idea, but like he realized. If you don't want someone to buy it, put a 1 million gold tag on it. May seem scummy but would reduce the chances of someone getting it greatly."

70,"Sep 9, 2022","How tf does this game decide what murder is?? Dokja says he hasn’t killed anyone, but I can’t help thinking there’s a bunch of people who have bled out because he left them with serious wounds… I mean, they address this issue once by having Sangha and Gil do the kill shot but it’s losing its believability pretty quickly… also where the f*ck did those weapon straps on that suit just appear from???"

70,"May 16, 2022",[The constellation theactorspandorum is proud that a herem is building minute by minute and might have a little tear]
70,"May 11, 2022",this constellation is slightly frustrated at this recurring scenario involving a woman taking orders from a guy who just happens to know better. 
70,"May 10, 2022",ranveer Khan wowwwww (it's nice to see Indian rep)
70,"May 7, 2022",so I rushed to the comments to say this. Ranveer khan isn't a name. khan is a semi Muslim last name. it refers to people from Khyber Pakhtun Khwa. while ranveer is a Hindu name. so someone named Ranveer Khan isn't likely.
70,"May 5, 2022","uhh ""a wall"""

70,"Feb 24, 2022","this ""Why are you running?"" made me remember a meme from my country (Brazil) -  ""senhora? volta aqui senhora"" - it's was a interview about... fiscal fraud (I don't really remember)? with a public servant. The woman says ""Eu nunca fiz isso (I never did it)"", and starts RUNNING, the journalist goes RUNNING SHOUTING ""senhora? volta aqui senhora (ma'am? come back here ma'am)""and the cameraman goes running behind them on the street"

It's the fact how little the first 30ish episodes (or more...correct me if I'm wrong) have very little likes and commnets(less than 15000 likes and less than 1000 comments). The episodes that have the foundation of the story. but once things get more spicy/fun/thrilling people start to like more and more. Please tell me the difference between these people and the constellation that were watching the channels just for thrill?!?!

70,"Sep 20, 2021",Considering how far Dokja has made it with the current scenarios. I think its same to say that these scenarios will become more unpredictable since the man is changing the future essentially
70,"Sep 18, 2021",I can't wait for his response and it will be true and that's because he doesn't know no one does except maybe the author

70,"Sep 23, 2022",i agree the reader prefer to kill right away without any loose ties

They'll die in the Apocalypse with that attitude. Seems Suyeong isn't all that bad. Maybe just a bit misguided. 
70,"Apr 7, 2022","Suyeong is actually really cute and dorky. I like how she was billed as this strong and threatening adversary but Dokja just pushes her around every chance he gets 😂. Literally held her by her forehead as he stole her phone 🤣 I'm excited to see how their relationship develops. Dokja was probably sad that his once friend Mr Yun turned into a bloodthirsty monster out for revenge. I wonder what he referred to by the ""rumors"". We're people at work spreading falls rumors about Dokja at work? "

56,"Jul 14, 2021","""an occupation stressful enough to cause dissociative identity disorder"" doesnt exist. DID can only be caused by reoccurring trauma and instability in childhood.

56,"Jul 14, 2021",Imagine being such an invested reader you know the story better than the writer themself
56,"Jun 28, 2021",love how they explained why the disciple wasn't wearing pants in that one random frame five seconds later

56,"May 26, 2021",So… anyone else think mr dokkaebi here looks snazzy af
56,"May 26, 2021",I am curious in what information this writer dude holds
56,"Jun 1, 2021",I just love how Gilyeong always rushes to Dokja at first glance when they reunite *cries in affection 
56,"May 27, 2021",AhahHA I can’t. He pinned that guy as a writer. *cries in unfinished manuscript*
56,"May 26, 2021",Huiwon's back and forth with dokja is priceless. Always brings a smile on my face ~ 
56,"May 26, 2021",petition for the author to add lazy broke weeb as a constellation 1 like= 1 signature
56,"May 26, 2021","I love that Gilyoungie automatically attaches himself to Dokja's leg, as always. 😂"
56,"Jul 14, 2021","Bruh, out of all the pictures they could’ve taken and used in Yoo Joonghyuk’s records, they used THAT one?"
56,"May 26, 2021","Anyone else wonder what J.Y. is thinking while staring at Dokja, who happens to be talking to a decapitated head 🤔"
56,"May 26, 2021",With the cooking level at 10 I can assume he is the next contender for Gordon Ramsay’s famous food reviews
56,"May 27, 2021","""He probably has a constellation who can handle such a backlash"" AHahahaHahAhHahAha 😭"
56,"Jul 14, 2021","He said A writer, not THE writer. So he may be writing fanfictions not the original novel"
56,"May 27, 2021","I'm highly amused how so many of us, yes myself included, look forward to finding Lazy Broke Weeb's sponsoring comment. They're very entertaining. "
56,"Jul 4, 2021","dokja's ""Wait, I'm still naked. Seongguk. Give me your pants."" got me 😂😂👌"

56,"May 26, 2021",Even Gordon Ramsey got nothing on Junghyeok yu with that cooking level
56,"Jul 14, 2021","So a reader, a writer, and a protagonist walk into a train station..."
56,"May 26, 2021","Heewon slapping Dokja again, how iconic 😌😌"
56,"Jul 14, 2021","We know that there are Writers, but what about EDITDORS?"
56,"Jul 14, 2021","""I thought you were done pretending to be Junghyeok?"" ""This is just how I am"" lmao 🤣"
56,"Jun 12, 2021","Thank you, Creator! This WEBTOON really helps me, to the point I’ve continuously kept up and spent what money I had to be able to read the fast passes!

56,"May 26, 2021","Not the main character of your story, go tell that to someone else😤"
56,"Jul 18, 2021",Dokja stopped pretending to be the protagonist so he was nicer but still took phones and pants 😂 i love how chaotic this character is
56,"Jul 14, 2021",YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH I LAUGHED AT THAT LAST LINE- IM A WRITER AND I FELT THAT LMAO

56,"May 27, 2021",This is one of my favorite WEBTOONs on this and I can’t really find the words to properly articulate what draws me in so much. Who else can agree with me?
56,"May 26, 2021","Anyone else get goosebumps when Dokja said ""are you, by any chance.... ...a writer?"" cause I did lol."

56,"Jul 14, 2021",Dokja really made the dude give him his pants LMAO
56,"Jul 14, 2021",i've said this before but cooking level 10 means male wife junghyeok 😳
56,"Jul 14, 2021","Ah yes, I too talk to living severed heads"
56,"Jul 19, 2021",well at least we know now that junghyeok can cook up some mad pasta or sth 
56,"Jul 15, 2021",I love Huiwon and Dokja's friendship!!!
56,"Jul 14, 2021",“Eyes on Tuesday Night” 😂😂😂
56,"Jul 14, 2021",The avatar... master of the four elements... 
56,"May 28, 2021",My gawd that full body panel of Junghyeok was delicious 
56,"May 26, 2021",Ok but why did Joonghyuk line up their heads like he's a cat offering things to their owner 😭
56,"Jul 20, 2021","""His head is decapitated, but he's still alive!"" Sir that's not a human any more that's a cockroach stay back"
56,"Jul 18, 2021",how dare there be less then a million likes? this is the greatest comic to have ever be WRITTEN and it doesn't NEARLY have as many likes as it deserves...
56,"Jul 15, 2021",I like how the Main Protagonist is just standing behind him and lets Dokja do his thing. At least he has a sense of dramatic.
56,"Jul 15, 2021",Dokja: I have stopped being mean.  Also Dokja: Gimme your f*cking (phone)!
56,"Jul 14, 2021","I kinda called the other dude whi said he read all the way to the end being the writer of TWSA but Dokja said ""A writer"" not ""The Writer"" so he isn't also as soon as he mentioned the Avatar skill and that panel showed up am I the only one that thought of Avatar The Last Airbender?"
56,"Jul 14, 2021",Junghyeok gathering all the heads like they're the infinity stones.
56,"May 28, 2021","how many more people have to start paying, to get 2 chapters per week? this comic is the only reason I am spending money on webtoons"
56,"May 26, 2021",How crazy would it be that he is the author??
56,"May 26, 2021",Honestly feel like cooking is the number 1 skill we need in a apocalypse. Prove me wrong
56,"Jul 16, 2021",It would be really funny if this comic went on for 10 years lol
56,"Jul 15, 2021",Junghyeok be cooking like a chef like a 5 star Michelin
56,"Jul 15, 2021","[The constellation 'Meggie-Elise' wishes to test Junghyeok's cooking skill.] [5 coins have been sponsored.] [The constellation 'Meggie-Elise' would like to pet a Dokkaebi and is wondering how many coins they would need to sponsor in order for that to happen.] [The constellation 'Meggie-Elise' laughs at ""This is just how I am.""] [The constellation 'Meggie-Elise' realizes that they talk too much.]"
56,"Jul 14, 2021",If he is a writer it makes sense that he has the avatar skill since writers create characters for their stories 
56,"Jul 14, 2021",Lmfao. A job that needs creativity but also stressful enough to get a dissociative disorder...definitely a writer
56,"Jul 14, 2021",“I guess it’s because I’m not the main character” says the main character 
56,"Jul 14, 2021",Oh shit! Reader VS Writer?! I'm guessing the decapitated guy didn't come here with his original body which is why he isn't bleeding. That's probably a clone. This is going to be impressive. But how does he know all of TWSA? Does he have a skill that lets him read it in bits and pieces?
56,"Jul 14, 2021",Not every protagonist can slay a dragon with their balls dangling in the wind
56,"Jul 1, 2021",Wow... Dokja really just deduced this man's identity in like 5 seconds. Kinda says a bit about the writer of omniscient reader viewpoint. Calling out the hardships of being a good writer
56,"May 26, 2021",Cool as a fan after decapitation but once Dokja starts talkin he looked shook!
56,"May 26, 2021",AAAAAAA THEY'VE MET FINALLYYY ot3 rights 💕
56,"May 26, 2021",Dokja really be intimidating everyone at this point and I love him for that
56,"May 26, 2021",Dokja looking so comfortable in that robe though
56,"May 26, 2021","""He's glaring at us to keep our mouths shut"" should be reversed since it's Dokja's pov and not the prophet's.
PS. Glad they changed feasibility to plausibility."
56,"May 26, 2021",WTF!? Why did Yoo Joonghyuk collect those apostles heads? What a psychopath
56,"Jul 14, 2021","Dokja: are you a writer , the man whose head is cut off( in his mind ):how does he know that. me HOW IS THIS MAN STILL TALKING 🤔🤔"
56,"Jul 14, 2021","I just realized that that TWSA lasted for 10 years, meanwhile we are reading about a character living through TWSA…aight here we go"
56,"Jul 14, 2021","omg, i wasn't expecting that. anyways, i hope that I'll be one of those 100 lucky readers then i can finally read ahead. how i wish. "
56,"Jul 14, 2021","but no occupation can cause DID, it's from childhood, isn't it?("
56,"Jul 14, 2021",I’m pretty sure that’s not how DID works...
56,"Jul 14, 2021","Dokja really has a thing for dying, doesn’t he?"
56,"Jul 14, 2021","for a decapitated head, they sure are pretty"
56,"Jul 14, 2021",GILYOUNG HUGGING DOKJA WAS ADORABLE 
56,"Jul 14, 2021","My mouth has been itching because I want to spoil you guys so badly ㅋㅋㅋㅋ But, I won't spoil you as I am a good girl ㅋㅋㅋㅋ"
56,"Jul 14, 2021",I shall… simp…. from a distance of course-
56,"Jul 14, 2021",damn i didn't know i missed junghyeok yu until this episode hsjhdjshshhshshs u handsome man-
56,"Jul 7, 2021","I wonder if he's a writer or if he's The Writer? The creator of TWSA has to be participating somehow right, even if just as a watcher? Could they maybe have a greater role?"
56,"Jul 7, 2021",Guess who’s gonna spend all her coins here? yes me ty for the attention
56,"Jun 24, 2021",FAST PASS IS BOTH A BLESSING AND A CURSE 🥲
56,"Jun 23, 2021","As soon as I saw the attribution of Immortal King I just realized her really hasn’t killed anyone. Yes he harmed people, but never killed anyone."
56,"May 30, 2021",Those aren't really good rewards for a dragon slayer
56,"May 27, 2021",“are you a writer?” oooo busted
56,"May 26, 2021",Noooo😭😭😭😭😭I was really hoping to read the next chapter. I bought over 800 coins today. I bought the other chapters today. I'm too invested in this webtoon.❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
56,"May 26, 2021",Dokja out here exposing ppl lol

56,"May 26, 2021",Well hello there first apostle/disciple 😌😌
56,"Jul 14, 2021",Has anyone else considered Prisoner of the Golden Headband is the Monkey King? Or is that just me?
56,"Jul 14, 2021","pls let the DID thing be explained better, god I dont want to stop reading because of misinformation"
56,"Oct 8, 2021","""your waste been excreted"" basically, he just took a virtual shit."
56,"Jul 19, 2021",Lazy Broke Weeb needs to be an actual constellation in this Webtoon. They're an icon now lmao
56,"Jul 18, 2021","Wait, so this guy claims to have read the entire novel even tho Dokja was the only reader... The only way that's possible is if that guy were THE writer. I honestly don't think so, but maybe he heard of the book, read through it a little, and with his creative writing knowledge predicted the end of the story? (this is only a off the top of my head theory)"
56,"Jul 15, 2021",when Lazy Broke Weeb is richer than me... 😭 WHAT AM I?????
56,"Jul 15, 2021",that constellation who wants huiwon to hit him again 🤣🤣
56,"Jul 15, 2021",can we see junghyeok’s cooking in action pls 😌 preferable not a stew made of beheaded disciples ofc
56,"Jul 15, 2021",So we have a reader a writer what’s next an editor?
56,"Jul 14, 2021",Cooking skill level 10? Send him to me mine is level -56546455 I can’t step into a kitchen without setting something on fire
56,"Jul 14, 2021","Aight so Dokja (whilst fighting a fire dragon) became king, died, came back to life and then killed said dragon. What a beast "
56,"Jul 14, 2021",I didn't like this mid level dokkaebi... older one was nice.. 
56,"Jul 14, 2021","[The constallation god of ♡ships♡ is curious as to what being a writer means, and is fighting off the naval god of warfare because they both command ships]"
56,"Jul 14, 2021",LMAO the author’s passive-aggressiveness shining through
56,"Jul 14, 2021",how am I supposed to wait a week for the next episode to come out 🤨
56,"Jul 14, 2021",I love Omniscient Reader so much...
56,"Jul 14, 2021","Uh, are we the Constellation [Eyes waiting for Tuesday Night]? This comes out on Tuesday nights for me..."
56,"Jul 14, 2021",The writer low-key telling us his job is hella stressful. keep up the good work and please try not to get D.I.D
56,"Jul 14, 2021","I say this every week, but I'm so excited for next week"
56,"Jul 14, 2021","One of the tips my creative writing teacher gave us when writing about someone you know, even if you change the name, they can still make a claim and come after you legally. They said the best way to guard yourself from that is to give them a small Willy and scrawny frame. Now I’m wondering who Dokja was modeled after irl 😂😅😜"
56,"Jul 14, 2021","oh he is a writer, okay.. the one who lack creativity so he stole other ppls work (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻"
56,"Jul 14, 2021",Ouuuuuuu fuckkk!!!!! A writer?!??? You mean the guy who wrote the novel you’re living in??!!? This is fucked up... 😭👌
56,"Jul 7, 2021",what im wondering is since that dudes head is on the ground and the main character jumps down his way with no underwear does that mean he saw his penis and the reason his face looks like that is because he saw something bigger than his and is now terrified....lmao😂😂😂
56,"May 27, 2021",Viewer is disappointed that he has to wait a week for the next episode
56,"May 26, 2021",Fight one of the final bosses and don't even get an item for it.  I would complain
56,"May 26, 2021","well, I've found myself in a state of distress. I don't wanna spend money, but if I don't get coins, I'll now have to wait 2 whole months to read the next chapter!!! guess I'm broke now 👌"
56,"May 26, 2021",[The constellation Lord of the Bleeding is irritated by how similar the Dokkaebi politics are to United States politics.] [He has sponsored 5 coins anyway.]

56,"May 26, 2021",He pulled that uno reverse card on the False First 
56,"May 26, 2021",Idk why but the constellation Eyes Until Tuesday  night resonates with me and sounds strangely familiar.
56,"May 26, 2021",constellation [eyes waiting for Tuesday night] knows the club goes up on a tuesday
56,"May 26, 2021",i bought more coins just for this webtoons 😭😭😭
56,"May 26, 2021",Did you see that guys face at the end? Dokja just called him tf out
56,"Jul 29, 2021","aww, I'm a bit disappointed the little conversation between dokja and the renouncers after he resurrected didn't get adapted to the webtoon (understandable, though. but it was such a great conversation and too good to be skipped).for those who curious about the missed conversation can see the reply below (don't worry this isn't a spoiler, just a nice little detail and brain-stimulating passage from the novel of this chapter (in the novel it was chapter 57)):"
56,"Jul 25, 2021",Wait... I'm actually shocked to realise that Dokja HAS NOT actually killed someone. I mean I just felt like he killed someone before but I guess not ...
56,"Jul 16, 2021","How magnificent it'll be if the Main Character, The Reader and and The Writer teamed up? WAAAAA"
56,"Jul 15, 2021",I did not picture the dokkaebis to be so cute 😍
56,"Jul 15, 2021","I do hope Dokja updates his wardrobe a little tho, his previous outfit didn’t do his 10/10 face, figure, and personality much justice. I know the white coat coming soon tho I’m fucking ready"

56,"Jul 15, 2021",Gilyoung hugging dokja 🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️
56,"Jul 15, 2021",I feel if this webtoon ever finishes the full story Lazy Broke Weeb will actually become a constellation
56,"Jul 15, 2021","It doesn't seem like surviving decapitation is that useful, unless you can attach it to another body. "
56,"Jul 15, 2021",if that is THE writer...fr idk...and then shouldn't he also know  dokja by name? cause that is how he received the email with twsa...but yeah if he is a different writer or smthn then idk...

56,"Jul 15, 2021",I have a sneaking suspicion that perhaps the constellation secretive plotter is the author of three ways to survive the apocalypse
56,"Jul 15, 2021",pfft- I loved that he just immediately figured them out lol
56,"Jul 15, 2021",I like how there’s a constellation of “eyes waiting for Tuesday night” because that’s when the WEBTOON actually comes out lol (also his body isn’t THAT skinny)
56,"Jul 15, 2021",jeez- I wonder how many coins he has... 
56,"Jul 14, 2021",dokja sitting in the corner holding his legs while huiwon slaps his back to no end was quite funny 😂

56,"Jul 14, 2021",Is no one gonna give him pants I feel like he doesn’t want people seeing his blegh parts ya know

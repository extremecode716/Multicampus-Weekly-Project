Episode,Date,Review
83,"Dec 15, 2021",Damn this man sent them to the Isekai world faster than Truck-Kun ever could
83,"Dec 15, 2021","That Dokkaebi is way too good at his job, immediately talking about a hot elf gf lmao"
83,"Dec 15, 2021",han sooyoung being mistaken as a minor... short people discrimination yet againedit: IM TALKING ABOUT THE PLAGIARIST. THE GIRL IN EMO BLACK HOODIE
83,"Dec 15, 2021",Weeping over the ‘Regressor’ ‘Returnee’ translation errors 😭
83,"Dec 15, 2021",A person is intelligent. people are stupid. never underestimate the capacity of human stupidity.
83,"Dec 15, 2021","There's a difference between regressor and returnee. The regressor is someone who in the moment they die they literally ""regress"" to a specific point in time. Like Yu Jung-Hyeok. And returnee is someone who goes to another world, dimension, galaxy, etc. And later they ""return"" to their original world. Please Webtoon, could you please change the translation? 🙏🙏🙏"
83,"Dec 15, 2021",God people can you shut the hell up and stop talking to the monster?
83,"Dec 16, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" is angry with the intervention of the high ranked dokkaebi.][The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" was impressed with the improvements of the incarnation ""ysa"".][5 coins have been sponsored. ]"
83,"Dec 15, 2021",Why would they want to go to his dimension when he looks like a starved caveman?
83,"Dec 15, 2021","I don't know how the translation teams are managed at Webtoon or if there are any at all, but for a while now translations have been ... whacky. Here it's still fine, but even as a Webtoon only, I can tell that Catastrophe-kun isn't a Regressor, but some sort of Returnee. Tower of God has had bad translations since SIU returned too. I hope this problem will be fixed soon, because in my opinion bad wording is very disrespectful to us readers and to the author whose work is mistreated."
83,"Dec 15, 2021",Who needs a hot elf girlfriend when you've got battle waifus in post-apocalyptic Seoul 😎
83,"Dec 15, 2021",So THAT'S the three ways to survive the apocalypse! I've always wondered what they were. 
83,"Dec 15, 2021",Imagine if this guy was a teacher giving tests. Thats a real catastrophe
83,"Dec 15, 2021","Now I'm even more confused about the translator for the webtoon. Ilsang is correctly called a returnee in the dialogue, but narration still calls him a regressor (which he isn't. heck, even webtoon only readers would know the difference)"
83,"Dec 15, 2021",I don’t think there were any hot elves where that guy came from 
83,"Dec 15, 2021","This is why humans irritate me honestly🤣That group made him stronger when they themselves were weak af, granted Dokja should've spoken up and told them not to speak (but I'm sure they wouldn't have listened because ""who is he to be giving orders""🥴)"
83,"Dec 15, 2021",He twists everything into an answer. Let's play the quiet game 
83,"Dec 15, 2021",I do have to say that those flames are rather pretty... I swear I'm not an arson! I just like shiny pretty things... and explosions
83,"Dec 15, 2021","“Returnee”, “Hunters’ Association” is this episode a crossover with The Druid of Seoul?"
83,"Dec 15, 2021",Damn when he was like “I’ve found you!!” What a fucking creepy face 😭😭 Daaang I wonder how Dokja and the squad are gonna get out of this one. (Also me seeing this episode will be free in 35 days: Nope. *spends 5 coins*)
83,"Dec 15, 2021","translators I am begging you please look up both the dictionary entry for ""regression"" and the original novel and ask yourselves if the way you're using the word has anything to do with either of those in the current context "
83,"Dec 15, 2021",Where the hell is our bro-kebi?! Our boy needs that support STAT!
83,"Dec 15, 2021","Some very satisfying moments are going to be coming up soon, it'll be great to see the art for it all. "
83,"Jan 19, 2022",The number of scenarios and sub scenarios they’ve got to complete is piling up like my college assignments 😭💀✌🏾
83,"Dec 15, 2021",Only 7 days left in the scenario and things are getting intense. 
83,"Dec 15, 2021","[Constellation, Director of Fate, sighs at the stupidity of the crowd of incarnations] [5 coins have been sponsored]"
83,"Dec 15, 2021",Just realized....we still have 7 days left. Oh man......
83,"Jan 19, 2022","These people are at the brink of dying,and still drooling over hot elf gf"
83,"Dec 15, 2021",Abyssal Black Flame Dragon says to pick up the slack. what a mood. 🤣
83,"Dec 15, 2021",man this has got some serious dragon ball style story telling you know the type destruction of a planet in 30 seconds spread over 10 20 minute episodes (and honestly this is a lot better)
83,"Jan 19, 2022","The fact that one of the guys in the crowd running away has a dog in his bag is strangely heartwarming. Like, sure there's an apocalypse going on and people are dying left and right, but he's not gonna abandon his little buddy <3"
83,"Dec 15, 2021",😭😭😭 pls fix the translation. Myeong Ilsang is a Returnee. I hate to be those novel readers elitist snob but this is such a disrespect to Sing Shong
83,"Jan 19, 2022","Sooyung became a full-time people carrier, 😂"
83,"Jan 19, 2022",Alright but there was a dude who had a puppy in his purse thats important
83,"Jan 19, 2022","Despite all the action with bloodthirsty catastrophies, I would be more worried about the original rules of sleeping 8 hours and eating three meals a day, when and where did they manage to do that  😂"
83,"Dec 15, 2021",RE-TUR-NEEnot regressor
83,"Jan 19, 2022",NOT DA HOT ELF GIRLFRIEND😭 DATS WAT YALL WANT? LIKE I MEAN RN? WHEN DA WORLD IS RUINED AND PPL ARE DYING?
83,"Dec 23, 2021","I forget her name, but I like how she complains about carrying people, but she literal clone jutsus that shit so she also doesn't have to carry people "
83,"Jan 19, 2022",actually in the original nove it isn't 'dance like monkey' but 'move your ass'. 😂😂😂
83,"Dec 16, 2021","Oh man, I'm glad a good number of ppl in the comments have already spoken up about the translation errors 😓 Also, can we talk about that person who was running away while carrying a puppo in their bag during Dokgak's dialogue? I hope they survive wherever they end up during this whole ordeal"
83,"Jan 19, 2022","hear me out, sangah is the author (just a theory)"
83,"Jan 19, 2022",Regressor is for people who comes back in time after dying; Returnee is for people who got isekaied and came back to their original worlds; Reincarnator is for people who are in a new body with memories of their previous lives after their deaths
83,"Jan 19, 2022",so happy to see they fixed the returnee translation :D
83,"Jan 19, 2022",I’m sorry but why is bloody KDJ so hot 
83,"Jan 19, 2022",Calling it now: the author must have survived by traveling back in time then. Large chance in my mind it's Dokja(Or maybe Stanford Pines lol)
83,"Jan 19, 2022",HUIWON YOU BETTER COME OUT NOW I MISS U AND THE OTHERS *SOBS*
83,"Jan 19, 2022","Someone: *breathes*Ilsang: Oh, that counts as an answer! *gets stronger*"
83,"Jan 19, 2022","Kim Dokja: Well I can't mansplain, manipulate, manwhore my way out of this one… //Yoo Jongyuk: *pulling out his sword* Manslaughter it is then."
83,"Jan 19, 2022",1. Regressor 2. Returnee 3. Reincarnator
83,"Dec 15, 2021",The manipulation in this one is strong damn
83,"Jan 19, 2022","“You’re hot, are you a middle schooler?” What a pick up line 👮. Also I’m pretty sure this survival scenario is a lot harder than C+ by now"
83,"Jan 19, 2022","if any of y'all is interested this webtoon is based of a Korean novel called omniscient readers viewpoint. I've been reading it lately and it's SUPER good!! u should check it out... 
... tho I will warn u it is like 6000 pages."
83,"Jan 19, 2022","This guy takes anything as answers, so you can't even tell him to shut up, damn"
83,"Jan 19, 2022","I just wanna say that to the Reader's who arew reading this, and Will read till the end, you'll be reading the same story for 10 years, More or less, so, when It finished you can be proud of yourself, and like Dokja, would read the same story for 10 years ...."
83,"Jan 19, 2022",Not a hot elf girlfriend 😭
83,"Jan 19, 2022",i feel sorry for the readers who read orv only in webtoon site with their stupid translation
83,"Jan 19, 2022",😂but that Avatar casually complaining is funny af
83,"Jan 22, 2022",i always see Natsumi_i and Cheesy as Pie in the comments for some reason lol
83,"Jan 20, 2022",“Hunters association” got me having flashbacks of Hunter x Hunter
83,"Jan 19, 2022",Anyone else somehow get jumpscared by a freaking webtoon
83,"Jan 19, 2022",why no one talking about how powerful Sangah has become.....
83,"Jan 19, 2022",Sangah is .....what??? I'm so intrigued
83,"Jan 19, 2022","The hunters association? Is he a climber from tutorial tower? Or was this an established thing?Also, follow up as I’ve learned new info, this could mean each of these worlds are interconnected in some way… a great wide multiverse "
83,"Jan 19, 2022","These people are so easy to convince ,only few  uses their brain.. Others just follow the crowd"
83,"Jan 20, 2022","Dokja, knocking on Jonghyuk's door, holding a Chinese dress and garter belt: Hello. //Jonghyuk, closing the door on Dokja's face: Goodbye."
83,"Jan 20, 2022","Dogak knows what the audiences love, the bastard is a marketing genius ha ha xD"
83,"Jan 19, 2022",dude he's a narcissist lol any response he deems an answer. that damn red guy playing on the hearts of the weak. that hot elf girlfriend love really got me ctfu
83,"Jan 19, 2022","That dokkaebi really just made all the weebs upset at  ilsang for going to another world lol, and ilsang low key kinda a menace, he even isekai'd those ppl, looks like truck kun has some competition. Also the dokkaebi said ""at least you no longer have to go into work"", mhmm so working is worse than possibly dying at anytime lmao"
83,"Jan 19, 2022","Kim Dokja fighting with his unbroken faith sword, Yoo Sangah fighting with three stigmas and then there is Han SooYong with a metal pipe... xD"
83,"Jan 19, 2022",35 days till C O A T 
83,"Jan 19, 2022","Lol Han Sooyung really needs to learn how to close her mouth 😂 though the real trick to fighting the disaster of questions… well, there’s two simple methods: Challenge a question with another question to avoid actually answering oor… that. Oof, yeah, Sangah’s stigmas definitely take a toll on her. I wonder if it’s the same for Her? Ugh, this bitch. Frankly, he’s a total bastard and deserves to be punished by the Star Stream for his cheating. At least Bihyung plays by the rules."
83,"Jan 19, 2022",Everyone keep quiet now..Pin drop silence please!
83,"Jan 19, 2022",he is weird
83,"Jan 19, 2022",Nice to see they changed the translation back to returnee
83,"Dec 16, 2021","Webtoon, how can you call him ""regressor"" and ""returnee"" in the same chapter ?! Aren't they editors who's suppose to check this kind of mistakes ?! He's a RETURNEE ! "

Yoo Sangah: Wow, impressive. //

Lee Seolhwa: Thanks. Then I’ll move on to Leos."
83,"Jan 20, 2022","i start reading this last night and i literally hoping that the ending will be like what Dokja experience lol. Its kinda fun experiencing what you have read, right? "
83,"Jan 20, 2022",I wonder...is it possible that you can weaken him by getting him to answer your questions?
83,"Jan 19, 2022","damn, Myeong is more irritating than I thought he would be. Also, Yoo Sangah pls marry me!!! "
83,"Jan 19, 2022","""But what if you call a catastrophe a treasure chest?"" those are some serious manipulation skills the Dokkaebi's got there"
83,"Jan 19, 2022",really glad they went back and fixed the translation error
83,"Jan 19, 2022",why are people having a convo here
83,"Jan 19, 2022",last panel reminds me of the Yelena shot
83,"Jan 19, 2022",Where did the leave Junghyeok?

83,"Jan 19, 2022","OMG, there are literally three ways to survive the apocalypse! And they're really specific! I guess all the reader comments weren't just from pendantic people... 😅"
83,"Jan 19, 2022",(Edit) Three ways to survive the apocalypse :- ———————————- —1. Return back in time( regressor-junghyuk). 2. Travel to different dimensions-isekai ( returnee-ilsang). 3. Reincarnate after death? ( reincarnator-???)

83,"Jun 11, 2022",I miss Gilyeong and Hyunseong 😭
83,"Mar 9, 2022",human stupidity never fails to make me despair
83,"Feb 8, 2022","Damn, I kinda love seeing Sangah acting so badass, but that's EXTREMELY suspicious of her. Even Gilyeong was more willing to kill people before, and he's a fricking child, so why would Sangah change so much in so little time? It just doesn't make any sense at all"
83,"Feb 8, 2022","This made me wonder again how old are the characters - we know about Dokja and Sangah (in their twenties) and Jihye (high-middle schooler), but how old is the plagiarist? And Junghyeok? The pro-gamer attribute throws me off sometimes, I am not able to imagine him doing something like that with the information we have about him at this point in the story..."
83,"Jan 28, 2022","the catastrophe mentioning a ""hunters association"" seems oddly familiar, like it's a reference but i can't pinpoint what exactly..."
83,"Jan 27, 2022",Sangha is what! Just say it dokja!! Please😞
83,"Jan 26, 2022",WHAT DOSE IT MEAN BY SOON? IVE BEEN WAIT SENSE 19 HOURS AND IM SO IMPATIENT 😩 😫 PLEASE 🥺

83,"Jan 23, 2022",thank goodness they changed the translation back
83,"Jan 22, 2022",at least I'm one of those who voted always every chapters i have read
83,"Jan 20, 2022",Something tells me Sangah might be a regressor!
83,"Jan 20, 2022","SMALL SPOILER FROM NOVEL
I THOUGHT THAT DOKGAK IS PAUL- XD- "
83,"Jan 20, 2022",What is this Attack on Dokja
83,"Jan 20, 2022",I'm unreasonably angry about how badly this returnee is misunderstanding the situation and believing whatever he wants.seems like he could be a powerfull ally if he would listen to reason.
83,"Jan 20, 2022",Dokgak is certainly interesting
83,"Jan 20, 2022","Dokja, I love you but, YOU FREAKING IDIOT 🤧😭😭😭"

83,"Jan 19, 2022","I can't believe this is still just 1 day, so much has happened ughhhh so awesome! "
83,"Jan 19, 2022",I really think that catastrophe of questions is Dokja from another dimension 
83,"Jan 19, 2022",ohhh come on stop!!! they're calling it returnee! they got the translation right in this chapter ok???? can I read some other kinds of comment????
83,"Jan 19, 2022",...Sangah is.... and we will never know what he was trying to say

83,"Jan 13, 2022","Damn it! I bought this chapter hoping that they changed the mistranslation but it's still there. 😡😡😡 Is there even someone proofreading Omniscient Reader? Just simply reading the very first panel (the phone screen) makes no sense how they even manage to translate it as 'Regressor' when it was written RIGHT THERE that there are THREE ways. 'travel back time' is a regressor, 'travel other dimension' is a returnee and 'born again' is a reincarnator. Line Webtoon, people are PAYING to read this😡"

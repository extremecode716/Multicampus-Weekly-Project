69,"Sep 8, 2021","Oh my god the constellation is right a harem is starting to form
Edit: The replies have a lot of minor spoilers, brave them if you wish"
69,"Sep 8, 2021",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' is delighted with the unexpected turnarounds of events.] [The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' is looking forward to get more surprises in this team up.] [5 coins have been sponsored. ]
69,"Sep 8, 2021",Dokja says it loud and proud… “You’re no beauty.” 🤣
69,"Sep 8, 2021","they was grinding 5,000 coins a day like scrubs. meanwhile Dokja can just do somthing badass and get 8,000 coins in few seconds."
69,"Sep 8, 2021","I really like how Dokja isn't portrayed as just a typical hero who wants to save everyone , but as someone who sticks to their own morales and does things to his own benefit"
69,"Sep 8, 2021",Dokja really just said “ you ain’t no Princess”😂 
69,"Sep 8, 2021",“A constellation who has been looking forward to a harem claps his hands in anticipation.” I’m dead 🤣
69,"Sep 16, 2021","*you are no beauty* According to all those ppl who you tried to trick that you're Junghyeok, neither are you, sir
Edit: SPOILER in 2nd reply"
69,"Sep 8, 2021",The disastrous life of Dokja Kim
69,"Sep 8, 2021","Dokja deciding who lives and dies while the gods just want a harem [+5 coins, the god of waiting every week supports your harem]"
69,"Sep 9, 2021","I feel like that ""eat 3 meals a day"" is too high of a requirement, I'm not even in an apocalypse and I don't have that much food"
69,"Sep 8, 2021",It seems my man needs to slap the f*ck out of each one of them to knock the sense back into them. Constellation’s gonna make it rain like it’s his birthday! 💰 
69,"Sep 8, 2021",I cannot WAIT for ya'll to see some of the stuff that happens in the webnovel. It only gets better. 
69,"Sep 8, 2021",No beauty? man shes gorgeous the hell you talking about? 
69,"Sep 8, 2021","I love how Dokja just casually dismantles an entire fighting ring, and gets a harem constellation praising him 🤣"
69,"Sep 8, 2021","""You're not a beauty"" my man is savage and I'm here for it "
69,"Sep 8, 2021",says the man who literally just stole someone else's pants and isn't even wearing a shirt
69,"Sep 8, 2021",“Scratches neck” y’all got anymore of them fast pass episodes? 
69,"Sep 10, 2021","Maybe it's the author's fault bc they're incapable of drawing ugly characters (this is sarcasm don't @ me), but how tf is Dokja ugly in this universe?? how is Sooyoung not a beauty?? Like, damn I wish I was ugly by those standards 😔"
69,"Sep 9, 2021","i kinda missed prisoner of the golden headband there, glad his back"
69,"Sep 8, 2021",I just love the interaction between Kdj and Hsy🤣
69,"Sep 8, 2021",YES TO OUR CHAOTIC KING AND QUEEN WORKING TOGETHER
69,"Oct 5, 2021",How many young adults in here still laughing about 3 meals a day and 6 hours of sleep?
69,"Sep 8, 2021",Ah I've been hoping they'd team up at some point since I was fond of the plagiarist's dumbass antics. I'm so glad lol
69,"Sep 8, 2021",I’m not saying I ship this new relationship…but I’m not saying I don’t either😗
69,"Sep 8, 2021","The final scenes are all too familiar to me. I remember being a moody pre-teen playing cops and robbers for a gym exercise. (Can't believe I even did this) As the cop, I would simply tag the males. Though if it were a female, I kid you not, I made 5 ladies trip on my foot in such a way that they would fall into my arms, and I bride-style carried them to the ""jail cell"". The teacher caught me and warned me not to do that again, whilst laughing menacingly. "
69,"Sep 8, 2021","me, trying to spend all my coins i stacked up from events before they expire due to webtoon's new policy: dokja just take them all...."
69,"Oct 14, 2021","I really like the fact that Dokja had this moment of clarity where he went “Wait, the hell am I doing?” I’m regards to letting people live or die based on how useful they are. I feel like there a lot of stories in the same vein as this where the protagonist wouldn’t hesitate to let people die for that exact reason. "
69,"Sep 8, 2021",Ready for this to turn into a harem series
69,"Oct 13, 2021","It's funny that they both have been called ugly when they look so much alike, when in reality they're both very attractive. People are just blind, I guess."
69,"Oct 14, 2021","Spoiler maybe:? Let me say. Romance isn't really present in this story. I see a lot of people holding on to that one constellation comment about a harem. And I don't want people dropping the webtoon because they think a harem is going to form, neither do I want people to be disappointed when a harem doesn't form. ORV consists of strong platonic relationships and found family, you can ship whoever you like, but that wasn't meant to be taken as foreshadowing. Sorry if I'm ruining the fun."
69,"Oct 13, 2021","I like this new dynamic. Unlike everyone else, she is less in ""awe"" of him because she (sort of) knows of the source material. This allows the two of them to banter freely."
69,"Sep 8, 2021","When he started setting it up I was like ""he's gonna say and you're no beauty"" The satisfaction is... *chef's kiss*"
69,"Oct 13, 2021",Pls they look like siblings lmao
69,"Sep 9, 2021",I think the plagerist is actually the prettiest character so far. 
69,"Oct 13, 2021","Actually, plagiarist girl is a pretty good match for Dokja. Both of them are real people (not characters), both of them liked reading trashy web novels, both of them have questionable morals and a willingness to commit extreme violence to get their way in this world. Truly a match made in heaven. "
69,"Oct 14, 2021",Lol is it odd they look like brother and sister?
69,"Oct 13, 2021",I think I know why Dokja made the plagiarist help with the fight. So he doesn’t lose King of no Killing. Since he needs to render enemies immobile for someone else to finish off
69,"Oct 13, 2021",those two are giving me bi panic at it's finest
69,"Oct 13, 2021",of course Dokja has high standard of beauty cuz of Jonghyuk😂
69,"Oct 13, 2021","I just realized, this scenario was designed to kill insomniacs "
69,"Oct 13, 2021",is it just me or does Dokja become more attractive each chapter?
69,"Oct 14, 2021",I love that ORV gives enough material for whoever you want to ship. Aro Dokja? Cool. He thinks about how hot everyone is but there’s no sign of romance. You wanna ship him with one of the girls? Go ahead. Sooyoung gets this moment. Heewon is his sword. Sangah was his friend before everything even started. You wanna ship him with the guys? He compares everyone’s hotness to Yoo Joonghyuk and spent more than a decade obsessed. Hyunsung is his shield and worships him.
69,"Oct 13, 2021",Nah when that guy said they get 5000 coins daily I burst out laughing 😂 if only they knew how much coins Dokja gets daily for basically doing nothing 
69,"Sep 8, 2021","how can you NOT just fall in love with dokja, that sass 🤣"
69,"Oct 13, 2021",She kinda looks like a female Dokja tbh. Which I find hilarious.
69,"Oct 13, 2021",imagine the ship wars amongst constellations
69,"Sep 8, 2021","one, I'm no hero, and two, you're no beauty...... his expression as he said that killed me XD."
69,"Oct 17, 2021","they look like a male and female version of each other, it makes sense he would say she isn't a beauty lol"
69,"Oct 13, 2021",“You’re no beauty” —KDJ being a savage as always
69,"Sep 8, 2021",And so the Righteous harem begins😂
69,"Oct 18, 2021",They have such a sibling dynamic they are both so horrible I love them
69,"Oct 13, 2021",I really like her 
69,"Sep 9, 2021",I will carry her if you dont want to kdj!! 🤲🤲🥺🥺
69,"Oct 13, 2021","i know Dokja said that to entice her, but she's a beauty"
69,"Oct 13, 2021","i love every character in this webtoon so much. everyone's dynamic is so fun to sit back and read cause it's so entertaining. plus the action, the plot, THE MORALLY GRAY MC and jung heewon, just her. i love jhw 🛐🛐🛐 "
69,"Oct 14, 2021","Finally, the third protagonist arrives! Everyone welcome the sassy witch with a sharp tongue, Han Sooyoung!"
69,"Oct 14, 2021","Bruh that constellation really said ""shippppp"""
69,"Oct 13, 2021","Frick frack, why did the artist have to make the plagiarist and Dokja look good standing next to one another?"
69,"Oct 17, 2021",have y’all noticed every episode it loses viewers so who gonna read the whole thing and be the lone reader
69,"Oct 14, 2021","""One: I'm no hero. Two: you're no beauty."" Heh, They both get ticked off at the same things."
69,"Oct 13, 2021",Dokja is not a simp lmao
69,"Sep 17, 2021",Dokja has to be my favourite protagonist
69,"Sep 8, 2021",pst author... want some coins? release another chapter... so we can spend coin
69,"Oct 17, 2021",dokja gets hotter and hotter every episode
69,"Oct 14, 2021","“It’s too late to try and look cool now” IDK Dokja, that last panel of posing looked pretty cool."
69,"Oct 13, 2021","""we're making 5000 coins a day"" meanwhile the richest mf alive is just standing there unimpressed"
69,"Oct 13, 2021",love it when the characters in the comic start to speak cliches themselves 
69,"Oct 13, 2021","Why do they look so good together? Everything about them is so similar, yet they’re polar opposites..."
69,"Oct 13, 2021",Dokja: it’s too late to look cool nowHe says as they both strike cool poses
69,"Oct 13, 2021","Dokja and the plagiarist look so freaking good together. They'd make a nice pair. I don't want a harem, but I do want Dokja to get into a relationship with her. I ship them heavy."
69,"Sep 9, 2021","God, I never imagined the banter between KDJ and HSY would look so funny XD"
69,"Oct 13, 2021","Harem? Where? I'm not even sure Sangah is even interested in Dokja like that, and Suyeong definitely isn't going to develop any. At least I would hope not, that'd be a cliche even more overdone than either of the cliches these two talked about just now in this episode. Only woman we have right now showing actual interest in Dokja romantically is our dear King of Beauty, Jiwon. So there's no harem here."
69,"Oct 22, 2021",she looks like she could be his sister and he treated her like one aswell 
69,"Oct 14, 2021",Is it just me or do they look like siblings?
69,"Oct 13, 2021",I think lazy broke dweeb is the constellation looking for a harem
69,"Oct 13, 2021",The plagiarist looks fine doe 😳
69,"Oct 13, 2021",I’m starting to like the plagiarist. I hope she becomes an alley and realizes the things she did was wrong. She has potential.
69,"Oct 13, 2021","huh, 5000 coins a day, how bout 8000 in 10 seconds"
69,"Oct 2, 2021",Wow first all the other characters calling Dokja ugly and now Dokja is telling Han Sooyoung she ain't a beauty. Lol this webtoon really said it may be the apocalypse but ugly is still ugly😂 (not that I find either of them ugly) Edit: There's a slight spoiler in the replies
69,"Sep 19, 2021",LOL it's to late for you to try to look cool now
69,"Sep 8, 2021","New title achieved, Thot Slayer."
69,"Oct 13, 2021","""A constellation who was looking forward for a harem clasps its hands in anticipation""
Well, of course I know them, they are us, the readers..."
69,"Nov 15, 2021",Omfg I knew he was gonna roast her when she called herself a beauty 😂😂
69,"Oct 22, 2021",oh my god dokja just gets hotter chapter by chapter-
69,"Oct 18, 2021",ohoho im starting to like Dokja and the plagiarists chemistry I feel like theyre gonna be a funny duo here 😂
69,"Oct 13, 2021",They do look good together tho
69,"Oct 21, 2021","dokja smile when he fights, i kinda like that 😆"
69,"Oct 20, 2021","if any of u are wondering why Dokja doesn't like Sooyoung, well... he describes Yoo Joonghyuk's beauty in ESSAYS so yeah hope that's enough explanation"
69,"Oct 17, 2021","he may not be the main character, but he sure acts like it "
69,"Oct 15, 2021",Their conversations are just constant sass
69,"Oct 13, 2021","“It’s much too late for you to look cool” he says, while looking cool. "
69,"Oct 13, 2021",haha like everyone is always saying dojka is not that pretty now he can finally say it to someone else 😂
69,"Oct 13, 2021","you get 5000 daily, he gets 5000 just by walking"
69,"Oct 13, 2021","The ""Constellation looking forward to a harem"" legitimately cracked me up. I was absolutely not expecting to read that."
69,"Oct 13, 2021",suddenly dokja look so hot than before :'D
69,"Oct 13, 2021","where is "" Lazybrokeweeb"" constellation in the comments?.."
69,"Oct 13, 2021","the “you’re no beauty” line is kind of interesting because in the context of deconstructing cliches it could be interpreted as “you aren’t a damsel in distress, you don’t need me to save you”. or maybe i am just projecting actual taste onto kim “the ugliest king” dokja because of my steadily growing crush on hsy 😐. speaking of which have i mentioned that i love her because i l"
69,"Nov 18, 2021",THEYRE SO HOT SLGJSNGUJSHGUDS
69,"Nov 15, 2021",He says it’s too late for her to look cool but I think that she has more cool in her smallest toe than I could ever dream of acquiring 
69,"Oct 18, 2021","finally caught up to this masterpiece after binge-reading last week (took longer than usual due to work 🥲) and can i just say how much i love dojka, his squad, down to the minor characters 😭 esp how his relationship with them continues to evolve that whenever something happens, everyone’s like: DOKJA!!! WAAAH can’t bear the agony of waiting for an ep every week!!! [The constellation, WEEBtoonislyf, is drowning in anguish and anticipation waiting for the next ep.]"
69,"Oct 13, 2021","I always saw the constellation who likes harems as a way of calling out a trope the authors dislike, honestly. Also AHHHGGHH!!! Looking forward to the Disaster of Floods arc!!"
69,"Oct 13, 2021","""you're no beauty"" 💀"
69,"Oct 13, 2021","Lol i love this pair. They call each other ugly and tease each other every time and when they’re in battle, they’re hella bad@ss"
69,"Oct 13, 2021",The start of a beautiful relationship 
69,"Oct 13, 2021","no no, y’all still look cool as hell"
69,"Oct 2, 2021",the harem constellation has their priorities straight
69,"Sep 30, 2021",I really love this too but you guys should definitely read the novel anyway I love how dokja dropped her like a sack of rice and told her she’s not pretty 😂😂 and I agree with that constellation dokja needs to have his harem hahahaha
69,"Sep 30, 2021",Dokja may have saved her but he then straight up murdered her with that line. 😂
69,"Sep 16, 2021",I don’t have any coins left… NOOOOOOOOO-
69,"Sep 11, 2021",congratulations you caught a tsundere would you to give it a nickname ____________
69,"Sep 8, 2021",I wanna say something witty but the fact the author confirmed possible harem status has got me too giddy to think of something
69,"Sep 8, 2021",You know that guy wasn't all there in the former lifestyle if he really thought everyone else around him was just as vindictive and psychotic. Wanderers seem to be a collection of those people who raised an internal red flag warning during a conversation 
69,"Nov 25, 2021","I wonder how many readers here would fail at the ""sleep for at least 6 hours every day"" part."
69,"Oct 26, 2021",Ik dokja ain't saying she's got no beauty🙄LIESSSSSSS
69,"Oct 21, 2021","“A constellation who has been looking towards to a harem claps his hands in anticipation” 😭😂 also, Dokja looked so hot when he sliced the bars of the cages, he looked like he was dancing 😌"
69,"Oct 21, 2021",how can people say that Dokja is not handsome?? he is drawn so beautiful and cool wtf
69,"Oct 20, 2021",LOL THAT CONSTELLATION WHO'S LOOKING FORWARD FOR A HAREM AHHAHAAHHAHA
69,"Oct 20, 2021",His smile when he was breaking the cages is beautiful 😁
69,"Oct 20, 2021",the constellation who wanted a harem 😭😭😭😂😂
69,"Oct 18, 2021",i should have waited for this to be completed TT-TT
69,"Oct 18, 2021",DAMN THEY BOTH STRONG AND PRETTY 
69,"Oct 17, 2021","You ask to be dropped, then you protest when you’re dropped? XD"
69,"Oct 14, 2021",That last panel was clean
69,"Oct 14, 2021",They’re hot 
69,"Oct 14, 2021","dokja: *breathes* +  5,000 . wanderers:😔"
69,"Oct 14, 2021",why are they both so hot please power duo
69,"Oct 14, 2021",I'm hoping a harem doesn't form. This comic has had a good mix so far and I want that to continue
69,"Oct 14, 2021","Ngl the plagiarist HAS DRIPPPPPPPP




and if possible i would yknow what im not gonna finish that sentence just know it had something to do with the"
69,"Oct 13, 2021",Will Junghyeok be part of the harem? hahaha
69,"Oct 13, 2021","“You got two things wrong, one, I’m not a hero, two… your no beauty.” Lol this is the kind of arguing relationship me and my sister have."
69,"Oct 13, 2021",I knew Dokja would say that she's no beauty lmao 😂
69,"Oct 13, 2021",im sweating gallons rn this duo is so hot goodbye 
69,"Oct 13, 2021",Webtoon be making me question my sexuality...
69,"Sep 14, 2021","damn... i cant believe i read this whole series in 2 days... but boy, im happy that i picked it up "
69,"Oct 14, 2021","Harem constellation, please leave"
69,"Mar 11, 2022","please don't let there be a harem, the story is to good to be messed up like that tsk tsk"
69,"Nov 28, 2021","The age old cliche of: “Let me down, but not like that!!”"
69,"Nov 19, 2021",That subscenario might be the only way to make me sleep 6h per night and eat 3 fair meals per day AND exercise by killing stuff to get coins 🤣🤣🤣
69,"Nov 18, 2021",I think she's a beauty though
69,"Nov 8, 2021",wow...the author really dropped a constellation that wants a harem...must be us.
69,"Oct 26, 2021","Yes, Kim Dokja beauty standars is Yu Jonghyuk"
69,"Oct 22, 2021","“The constellation clasps his hands in anticipation of a harem.”I just can’t anymore, I’m dying😅...."
69,"Oct 21, 2021",Their banter is hilarious 
69,"Oct 20, 2021","""it's too late for you to look cool now"" damn dokja you don't have to be so savage 😭"
69,"Oct 20, 2021","Just dokja being savage af the entire time - 1. ""I ain't any HERO"" 2. ""You ain't beauty"" 3.✨ The reader(dokja) believes in democracy and equality despite religion/caste/creed/race/SEX! drops to fight together ✨"
69,"Oct 18, 2021",I love how they argue over things like this.
69,"Oct 17, 2021",dokja s eyeliner tho 😫😫😫🤌🤌🤌🤌 chef kiss
69,"Oct 17, 2021","[A constellation whos has been looking forward to a harem clasps his hands in anticipation.]

69,"Oct 17, 2021",His abyssal black dragon disagrees... 😏
69,"Oct 16, 2021",Boy I was Hollerin when he dropped her like that lol
69,"Oct 14, 2021","Okay, which one of you mf ended up being the constellation wanting a harem? Guys, we talked about breaking the fourth wall..."
69,"Oct 14, 2021","The reader, the plagiarist, shiii all we need now is the actual author"
69,"Oct 14, 2021",next ep is 69 😊
69,"Oct 14, 2021","Dokja lied as natrual as he breathedwhen he said she wasnt pretty...
like your eyes alright m8?"
69,"Oct 14, 2021",I just love that the is a constellation that wants a harem. It's just too funny 
69,"Oct 14, 2021",DHSKDHIF i love this episode 🤧 1) THEY LOOK SO BADASS IN THE END 2) DOKJA IS SO COOL LIKE WTH DID YOU SEE HIM SLICE ALL THOSE CAGES (and legs of his coworkers) and 3) THERE'S A CONSTELLATION THAT LOOKS FORWARD TO A HAREM AHDJAHAJA I LOVE THIS WEBTOON TOO MUCH
69,"Oct 14, 2021","""A Constellation who looks forward to harem claps hands in anticipation"" and probably at least one Third of the Readers"
69,"Oct 14, 2021","I like how I said that Dokja was slowly getting a harem, AND THEN LIKE TWO SECONDS LATER, THE HAREM CONSTELLATION POPS UP—"
69,"Oct 14, 2021","Dokja, why are you single again?"
69,"Oct 14, 2021",The harem line... I'm deceased ☠️
69,"Oct 14, 2021","Why is it that in all the cover arts of the LN tho, Dokja is portrayed to be just as good looking as Junghyeok and Suyeong but here he’s portrayed as slightly above average"
69,"Oct 13, 2021",I’m glad we learned more about the requirements for the “King of No Killing”
69,"Oct 13, 2021",Han-seuyoung is probably my favorite character in the series! I've got 50 chapters left in the web novel and it makes me sad.
69,"Oct 13, 2021",Man drinks his gender equality juice. Homie aint no simp
69,"Oct 13, 2021",aren’t they siblings lmaoo
69,"Oct 13, 2021",Huiwon and her would be besties just sh**ng on dokja lmao

69,"Oct 13, 2021",dokja: you’re no beauty.me: SHE IS VERY GORGEOUS TO ME! 😮‍💨🤚
69,"Oct 13, 2021",i keep looking at that last panel and being violently reminded of how bi i am. as soon as an episode drops with both of them AND jhw together you will never hear from me again because i will have died of fictional characters being too hot for their own good. 
69,"Oct 13, 2021",that's it. i have a big time crush on dokja.
69,"Oct 13, 2021",mans no simp

69,"Mar 28, 2022","Him: "" you're no beauty "" her: eMoTional DaMage~"
69,"Mar 8, 2022",I don't think the artist realizes how fast people die when their limbs are cut off. No way the people dokja is slicing up are living.
69,"Dec 22, 2021",Knew he’d say ‘you’re no beauty’
69,"Nov 25, 2021",Am I the only one who doesn't want a harem? 
69,"Nov 21, 2021",but... she is a beauty 🥺

69,"Nov 13, 2021","""you're no beauty"" 😭"
69,"Nov 11, 2021",It’s kinda funny to me bc they literally look like they could be fraternal twins lmfao

69,"Nov 3, 2021",The Constellations are doing the same thing the readers are doing. 😂 Take our coins! 
69,"Nov 3, 2021","I love how blunt he is, also, it seems like his moral compass is still somewhere in there"
69,"Oct 31, 2021","""its too late for you to look cool""😂😂"
69,"Oct 28, 2021",author of this Webtoon must really like drawing this episode....🤣🤣🤣🤣

And I'm broke AF"
69,"Oct 20, 2021",I don't like the 3 meals or 6 hour rest rules
69,"Oct 20, 2021",This is the best WEBTOON I have read in a long time. 
69,"Oct 19, 2021","Is no one gonna acknowledge the fact that the ""plagiarist"" looks exactly like dokja almost as if they are siblings hmmm"

""you're no beauty"" DAAAANG xD"
69,"Oct 16, 2021","Sangah, as always a good person who tries to make friends with people like Dokja 😍 Can she be more loveable?"
69,"Oct 16, 2021",they suit eachother very well but I ship him with sanga
69,"Oct 16, 2021",One would think he technically saved a few other lives releasing all those people from cages … or is that why it showed 14 instead of 1?
69,"Oct 15, 2021","""Looking forward to a..."" bruh."
69,"Oct 15, 2021","Considering how Retail Workers are treated, are we really surprised by this?"
69,"Oct 15, 2021",I'm worried that Dokja is going to forget to eat one of his meals 😱
69,"Oct 14, 2021",Dokja rlly insulted himself and then insulted her…mans has no mercy THEN FKN DROPPED HER I CANT 😭😂💀
69,"Oct 14, 2021",Hahahha dokja is so savage! 😂😂
69,"Oct 14, 2021",Ok but she looks like his sister lmao
69,"Oct 14, 2021",That moment when your enemy is not your enemy anymore but you still act like enemies. Him and Sooyoung look a lot like siblings in the art style if I’m honest 🙏.
69,"Oct 14, 2021",A constellation who was looking been forward to a harem 💀💀💀💀💀💀
69,"Oct 14, 2021","ok, I may not like the plagiarist, but she looks like the coolest wannabe with dookja and their swords"
69,"Oct 14, 2021",Idk man you both look pretty cool rn
69,"Oct 14, 2021",I’m mentally preparing myself for when the Apocalypse is here and every event in this webtoon starts to happen
69,"Oct 14, 2021",Dokja: Let my people go
69,"Oct 14, 2021",damn dokja I thought she was real cute but by his standards I guess not ctfu
69,"Oct 14, 2021",Dokja was so badass in this chapter! Omniscient reader does it again with the awesome chapters 👍🔥
69,"Oct 14, 2021","""It's to late for you to try and look cool""Looks pretty cool to me ngl"
69,"Oct 14, 2021",Dokja knows how to spice things up and when to be honest. 
69,"Oct 14, 2021",I disagree with the statement that the plagiarist is no beauty. I would say she is a solid 8/10
69,"Oct 14, 2021",Bro she seriously said she was OOM lol
69,"Oct 14, 2021",He straight up said “ your ugly” 
69,"Oct 14, 2021",Former friend vs. former enemy
69,"Oct 13, 2021","""it's too late to look cool"" he says, then the next frame is the both of them looking awesome... "
69,"Oct 13, 2021",currently conflicting whether i should use my only 5 coins to fast pass 😩
69,"Oct 13, 2021",“You’re no beauty” Savage 
69,"Oct 13, 2021",that one harem constellations LMAO
69,"Oct 13, 2021",There is no FL in this webtoon but she is the closest to being a FL. A Queen rather.
69,"Oct 13, 2021","huh, the webtoon kinda toned down the violence in this part compared to the novel. didnt even show the rape that were going on and how they were playing rock paper and scissors to see who goes first in raping the plagrist girl. has a different sense of danger."
69,"Oct 13, 2021","really? The word you could have gone for is family, but you decided to use the word harem? commenters be stupid"
69,"Oct 13, 2021",is it bad that I like certain web toons so much I look in the comments for certain comenter because they make the chapter better with their fun comments this web toon (lazy broke weeb) because I enjoy their comments and how they interact like a constalation. XD
69,"Oct 13, 2021",The plagiarist needs to join their found family
69,"Oct 13, 2021","in the novel I shipped Dokja-Suyeong, here I'll do the same"
69,"Oct 13, 2021","kdj: ""you are no beauty""me: [k im d ok j a i s al ia r] 😂
but man, hankim dynamics hit different 😔 one is a reader and the other is a writer, and also in the same genre! you can expect their interactions to be interesting and meta af, even moreso if we also add yjh as the 'protagonist'; we can get a unique golden trio here"
69,"Oct 13, 2021",that last pose was awesome
69,"Oct 13, 2021",okay but this duo dokja and suyeong.. iconic
69,"Oct 13, 2021",What does wearing dark clothing have to do with anything?
69,"Oct 13, 2021",'You're no beauty' well dokja I can't wait to see you change your mind 😉
69,"Oct 13, 2021",ah yes cause junghyeok is the only beautiful one in your eyes 😌
69,"Oct 13, 2021","the art in this webtoon is too good for anyone to be ugly. my man kim ""ugliest king"" dokja gotta be one of the prettiest guys i've ever seen. hsy is canonically good looking but i didn't expect she'd be THIS pretty. my point is, everyone in this webtoon is far too good looking and i am weak "
69,"Oct 13, 2021",hey when did he eat last....
69,"Oct 13, 2021","Man, even if I had 500 coins to pay every day, I would die in this subscenario... it's basically saying ""self-care or DIE"" and I suck at self care. "
69,"Oct 13, 2021",I finished reading the novel...still bawling out 😭😭 seriously this novel is so damn incredible and is now my top favourite 😭😭
69,"Oct 13, 2021",Dokja gay as hell how come she's no beauty?! (comment for jongdok shippers)
69,"Oct 13, 2021",It may not fall into the “hero saves beauty” cliche but it sure seems like it’s falling into the “op fantasy character forms a harem cliche” 😏
69,"Oct 13, 2021",sooooo.... if i don't meet the 6hrs of sleep requirement since i'm an insomniac do i fail?
69,"Oct 13, 2021",Hes hot Shes hot Everyone is hot
69,"Oct 13, 2021",I'm getting some serious sibling rivalry energy from them
69,"Oct 13, 2021","Oh Dokja 😂 ""You're no beauty."" 😭 ""It's too late to look cool."" 😭😭"
69,"Oct 13, 2021",cant believe kdj is finally wrong. hsy is so hot. so cool and swag. every time i look at her i get 28200384 times gayer. she has so much gender literally give it to me right now. webtoon refused to put her in the story for over a year because they were scared of what i could do when my crush on hsy surpasses the size of the sun.
69,"Oct 13, 2021",got tired after 30 minutes of liking every comment that said Han Sooyoung is pretty🥲🥲
69,"Oct 13, 2021",I am starting to like her more and more
69,"Oct 13, 2021","Firstly, shes hot. Secondly, a harem is an amazing idea. Thirdly, shes hot. And lastly, Dokja and Han make an awesome ass duo.🤙"
69,"Oct 13, 2021",Han Suyeong best girl <3 I can’t wait to see more of her !!! 
69,"Oct 13, 2021",STOP IT THIS IS KINDA CUTE

69,"Oct 13, 2021",That’s one based constellation
69,"Oct 13, 2021",Only Dokja could pull this off 😂 they’re all grinding for a measly 5000 coins when Dokja got 8000 in a few swings of the sword. Also the pettiness & bickering is next level in this episode. I feel like the plagiarist will become and ally tho
69,"Oct 13, 2021",LOVE THEIR INTERACTION
69,"Oct 13, 2021","""You're no beauty"" Probably the only time I'll disagree with KDJ"
69,"Oct 2, 2021",holy shit dokja just did her dirty like that
69,"Sep 21, 2021","""No beauty""? I think this might be the first time I disagree with you Dokja."
69,"Sep 10, 2021","Hahahaa not true as a software developer I confirm we love our QA teammates, saving our asses from our dumb mistakes one test at a time ♥️"

69,"Sep 8, 2021",Take my money
69,"Sep 8, 2021",I love this webtoon 2 muchhow do ppl even compare this to Solo Leveling when the writing of this is so much better?
69,"Aug 24, 2022","You know I hate garbage writing like this. ""I can't decide to let people live or not based on how useful they are"" Yet he does that all the time. He would have killed pildu gong if he wasn't so useful. Walking hypocrite. "
69,"Aug 11, 2022",Dokja just not finding any interest in any girl or woman in his life is what I live for 🤣
69,"Jul 30, 2022","Dokja: ""You are no Beauty."" Everyone: ""He can't be Junghyeok! TWSA said he was handsome! this man isn't!""
Me: Lord everyone is so freaking honest and flat out blunt is hilarious! 🤣🤣"

69,"Jan 25, 2022",I can’t stop thinking about the dude who is walking around in only boxers
69,"Jan 17, 2022",(SPOILER) i already read that dokja doesnt end up w anyone so im content in reading this cuz im not a fan of harems
69,"Jan 10, 2022",I thought Sangah would show up since she worked there as well but I guess she doesn't have the most ties with it or just that Dokja hasn't bumped into her yet. Very worried about Gilyeong rn
69,"Jan 6, 2022",as soon as he said 2 things I knew he was gone say shes ugly 😂

69,"Oct 13, 2021",It took Dokja until now to figure out that he's been deciding the lives and deaths of people based on their worth? or was that not something he was doing?
69,"Oct 13, 2021",Being able to enjoy bickering with each other regardless of what else is going on at the time is a major companion goal of mine
69,"Oct 13, 2021",I love HSY and KDJ 's dynamic so much 😭
69,"Oct 13, 2021","theory: if a constellation doesn't need to be historical figure then could it be something from a modern work of fiction. could 40K Gods be in this comic. I want to see a chaos Space Marines shout ""blood for the blood God"" and ""skulls for the skull throne"" in this comic."

88,"Jan 19, 2022","Wait you can have multiple constellations???  I wonder if its because these constellations are all in one well known group they are all associated with.  And I wonder, are they all considered as one or is it considered as mulitple?"

88,"Feb 23, 2022","wow, she has the entire Olympus gods as her supporting constellations. I assume since it is specified as ""Olympus"", it means those who live and rule from that realm. So no Hades, Hepesthos or Poseidon, but still Zeus, Apollo, Athena, Afrodite and Hermes at least"

88,"Jan 21, 2022",He stole the book. It‚Äôs gone from the stack in the second frame. And his behavior too lol trying to play it off.
88,"Jan 19, 2022","How is her having that many constellations, as far as we know even tho it‚Äôs probably more of a loophole, support her even possible. Also what I haven‚Äôt seen anyone ask or wonder is, why is Sangah the chosen one of the attention of not just one, but many if not all of some of the most notable gods [constellations] out there? She‚Äôs obviously really good at what she‚Äôs doing, but they would‚Äôve had to have chosen her before they knew she would do that well"
88,"Feb 23, 2022","""A constellation who loves kpop wants to be your supporting constellation"" KPOP FANS WHERE ARE Y'ALL üòÇ"

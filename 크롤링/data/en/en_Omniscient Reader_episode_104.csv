Episode,Date,Review
104,"May 11, 2022","""Have you been thinking thar far ahead already?"" Sir, you have no idea. NO IDEA. "
104,"May 11, 2022",kdj: breathes // the rest of the gang: AS YOU WISH MLORD
104,"May 11, 2022",Gilyoung sticking out his tongue on the mid-level dokkaebi lmao
104,"May 11, 2022","Dokja refused the throne, but he’s still the king. Prove me wrong… "
104,"May 11, 2022","junghyeok, who spent the majority of the scenario being bondaged: *gives a few emotionally distanced speech to Shin Yuseung* my work here is done"
104,"May 11, 2022",kim dokja: I HAVE OUTSMARTED YOUR OUTSMARTING
104,"May 11, 2022","In this world of the Star Stream, although we may get lost in the story, we should never forget the presence of the audience. This game is not simple to play, and the protagonists of our story need to be not only brilliant warriors and strategists within the scenarios, but great actors and long range planners of the bigger picture as well. We may forget, but they never do. Let's take this moment to appreciate this rarely evident extra burden they carry."
104,"May 11, 2022",kim dokja collecting allies and supporters like it's a freaking pokemon game :^)
104,"May 11, 2022","why does this mid dokkaebi act like he's the author >< like duh, dokja knows more about this more than you"
104,"May 11, 2022","THE NEUTRAL KING ONLY APPEARING NOW REALLY SUITS HIS PERSONALITY LMAO, HE ALSO ONLY APPEARED AFTER THE FIGHT ENDED ON THE 4TH SCENARIO."
104,"May 11, 2022","It says defeat, not kill. I call a silver lining."
104,"May 11, 2022","The only thing Shin Yoosung had left was her pride. No matter where in this universe, no matter which worldline she go, she'll never find the precious companions in her memories. Yet, for a better future she believes in, she endured a thousand of years traveling to finally appear as the final disaster of the 5th scenario."
104,"May 11, 2022",That mid-level dokkaebi is the object of my contempt ತ_ತ
104,"May 11, 2022",I really like the how the person Shin Yoosung hated turned out to be the person who understood her the most. Like it really shows that your pain might be understood by the person you least expect 🥹
104,"May 11, 2022",The Mid—level dokkebi is like that DM that’s trying too hard to screw over certain characters plot lines/development cause they don’t like how they wrote their characters
104,"May 11, 2022",Thought that far ahead…? silly baka!! he’s been thinking about this since he was in high school!!!!
104,"May 11, 2022","technically, by getting rid of her reason for being a catastrophe, that should satisfy the condition of ""defeat the catastrophe"". I also KNOW some of the gods would love that work around."
104,"May 11, 2022",yjh's back so wide and lonely......aaaaa😭😭
104,"May 11, 2022","""i didn't know the incarnations of seoul would be such cowards."" BIATCH like your stinky poofy ass isn't?! get outta here, you're not even a supporting character, you're just a single-arc extra!"
104,"May 11, 2022","Will someone who reads the Original Korean help me out here: Does the original scenario include a word that may be translated to ""kill"" or is it specifically ""Defeat""? If it doesn't specify ""kill"" then they don't have to actually kill the catastrophe to defeat it and that would make the mid-level Dokkebi really dumb to be pushing the ""kill the catastrophe"" narrative."
104,"May 11, 2022",I feel so bad for Bihyung. Sure he is a sadist but I honestly want to see him succeed. I mean compared to these mid level dokkaebi he's a cinnamon roll.
104,"May 11, 2022","By definition, she is already defeated."
104,"May 11, 2022","Man, that were all the remaining kings follow Dokja is SO COOL. But it leaves me wondering how long will they follow him?? How long until they don't see him worth risking their lifes for? "
104,"May 11, 2022","WHEN YOU'RE INSANE ENOUGH TO WARRANT A PERSON WHO LIVED 200+ YEARS SAYING ""WHAT TF IS THIS GUY DOING..."""
104,"May 11, 2022",Dokja is indeed a king even without the throne. Slay!!!
104,"May 11, 2022","OKAY, MAYBE I DO LIKE YOO JOONGHYUK AFTER ALL"
104,"Jun 15, 2022","this chapter made me cry into my oatmeal. gosh Yoo Joonghyuk is such a complex character. he was introduced as this psychopath who would do anything to achieve his goals, and in the past few chapters, we've been seeing the man who Kim Dokja choose to read about for over a decade, the man who cares so so much for his companions, but has taught himself to repress those feelings for the sake of reaching his ideal ending. I'm not sure if I worded this properly. man I just have feelings"
104,"May 11, 2022","and as someone said before, defeat the catastrophe doesn't necessarily mean kill"
104,"May 11, 2022",I have a bad feeling about the mid dokkaebi 
104,"May 11, 2022",even the dokkaebi know he's more than just a regular guy now. they are starting to have expectations.
104,"Jun 15, 2022","happy Pride Month to Yoo Joonghyuk's Wide and Lonely Back, and to Kim Dokja, who took a detour from am emotional scene to talk about Yoo Joonghyuk's Wide and Lonely Back, emphasizing how wide it is"
104,"Jun 15, 2022","""I could read the emotions in Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes. Since I was able to read them, Yoo Joonghyuk felt strange to me for the first time. I had never seen such an honest Yoo Joonghyuk."" Kim Dokja monologue when watching Joonghyuk and Yoosung's conversation"
104,"May 25, 2022","Yoo Joonghyuk is a VERY pitiful person. It's easy to hate him and in fact, I'm already seeing a lot of readers hating him. But if you consider his future as someone with no choice but to repeat his life, his constellation (wink wink) is really trying to mess this man's mentality. He's living a fucked up 'trial and error' life. If he fails, he'll witness his loved ones d word countless times, over and over again."
104,"May 11, 2022",Dokja keeps collecting minions (*ahem* I mean allies) like some Pokémon game 🙌🏽 
104,"May 11, 2022",The worst part of this story is when each chapter ends… I just want more 
104,"Jun 15, 2022",probably the first time Junghyeok expressed this much? 
104,"May 25, 2022","""It was the first time I noticed that Yoo Jonghyuk's back was so big and wide. His back was wide and lonely."""
104,"May 11, 2022",Not gonna lie but I low key want this animated.👌
104,"May 11, 2022",Future Yuseung’s just sitting there missing an arm going “What the fECK is happening right now?!”
104,"May 11, 2022",Yuseung being protected by people she doesn’t even know makes my heart melt. Just the look on her face- I cant wait to see what her relationship with Dokja will be like 
104,"May 11, 2022",Dokja please tell me this Dokkaebi dies during this scenario in TWSA bc I cannot stand his ugly goat mug anymore
104,"May 11, 2022","""Centuries"" by 21 pilots really describing Dokja right now"
104,"May 11, 2022","Telling a minor God to go stuff it, I love you Dokja Kim"
104,"May 11, 2022","Dokja's literally the strongest in the current scenario. Trying to fight him with all of his teammates who are as strong as the scenario allows would be suicide. Not to mention that if they do somehow beat all of them they'd then have to fight a Catastrophe right after? They're not cowards, they're just smart. "
104,"May 11, 2022",Seeing Namwoon again makes me feel like it’s a possibility he’ll return again somehow (he’s in the flashback of yuseung’s friends). 
104,"Jun 15, 2022","Dokkaebi: ""Have you been thinking that far ahead already?"" ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎Dokja: *breathes in 3,149 chapters ahead* ""Yes."""
104,"May 11, 2022","“have you been thinking that far ahead already?” nah honestly im just winging it at the point, dokja probably lol"
104,"May 11, 2022",Gil being the same chaotic good we all know him to be. Bless this kid 
104,"Jun 15, 2022",Gilhyeong wanting to punch the catastrophe because she beat up Titano is adorable when you consider Titano is huge and strong and Gilhyeong is a child 
104,"Jun 15, 2022","This probably going to end around 2030-2035. If there arent any breaks taken, just a continuation till the last chapter and I'll be in my 30s by then. By my calculations, it ends in 2031 but you never know about unforseen events. "
104,"May 11, 2022","That Mid Level Dokkebi Is such a stuck up entitled POS. bruh like fuk off, u got played u fucking idiots. stop whines geez lmao. That's why He's MID "
104,"May 11, 2022",I have fallen down the rabbit hole that is spending coins. I like it here...
104,"Jun 16, 2022",Gilyeong is becoming as bold as dokja lol that big brother influence haha 
104,"Jun 15, 2022",What happened to LAZY BROKE WEEB  and why can't I find since 101?
104,"May 11, 2022",I like how this is playing out. I love heroes. They are missed in this era of corrupting and trivializing their value. Be our hero Dokja 👍
104,"Jun 15, 2022",“Have you been thinking that far ahead already?”MC: “I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you!”
104,"Jun 15, 2022","Not the loophole I was expecting to be exploited, but a very good loophole exploitation non the less. (I expected the ""It says defeat her, not kill her. She's clearly defeated."" Loophole) (Seems the sub scenario also has this loophole! ""Hey, Catastrophe, you're defeated, RiiiIGHT?"" ""Yes?"" ""Hear that, She's been defeated! Now pony up the coins you God Dam* Lamb Man!"" (Both middle fingers pointed at the goat bi*ch.""))"
104,"Jun 15, 2022",You are special. You are loved.
104,"Jun 15, 2022",dokjas waist tho
104,"May 11, 2022","this translation is BAAADDD. joonghyuk says that ""I do all these things because they are my past and I cannot deny what has already happened to"". the way the translations have been written is utter trash dialogue. I'm so disappointed"
104,"Jun 16, 2022",I think Dokja’s favorite hobby is pissing off dokkaebi lmao
104,"Jun 15, 2022",Homie is playing 4D chess and that administrator is still playing checkers.
104,"Jun 15, 2022",man i love the way everyone backing him up
104,"Jun 15, 2022","""If I die, I'm taking you with me. Don't you forget it"" hahahaha what an odd and funny relationship these two have"
104,"Jun 15, 2022",Dude is pulling loopholes out of his ass
104,"Jun 15, 2022",“Perhaps this was the warmest Yoo Joonghyuk could be. It was the first time I noticed that Yoo Joonghyuk’s back was so big and wide. His back was wide and lonely.” (ch 105)
104,"May 11, 2022","[Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" shows signs of hostility towards the mid-grade dokkaebi for trying to get his way. 5 coins will be sponsored to everyone who defends the 41st round Shin Yoosung.]"
104,"Jun 16, 2022",What if... there's a guy who used incognito to read the manga so there are two who read and finished the series.
104,"Jun 15, 2022","OMG!I READ DE COMMENTS TO NOW WHAT PEOPLE THEORING ABOUT!
BUT FOR THOSE WHO ARE READING THIS FOR THE SECOND TIME, STOP WITH THE SPOILERS "
104,"Jun 15, 2022","Just saw a top comment that Gilyoung is sticking his tongue out on the Dokkaebi P*ul, making it clear no one likes P*ul 😤"
104,"Jun 15, 2022","Isn’t there a quote or something that goes something like “it takes true courage to spare a life?” Or something. So it’s pretty funny that the dokebbi is saying that it’s cowardly for the Seoul dome to be sparing the catastrophe of floods. And that seems pretty brave to me, she’s literally a catastrophe who almost took out Jihye, Gilyeong, Yu, and Hyesong all by herself, and they’re some of koreas best fighters right now "
104,"May 11, 2022",Dokja always be summoning his harem
104,"Jun 17, 2022",WHERE IS LAZY BROKE WEEB I HAVEN'T SEEN THEIR COMMENTS FOR A FEW CHAPTERS NOW AND I'M CONCERNED
104,"Jun 16, 2022",webtoon kim dokja is so pretty and for wHat
104,"Jun 16, 2022",i’m waiting for my girl heewon to show up ahhhh
104,"Jun 16, 2022","I mean the scenarios goal is to defeat the catastrophe, the catastrophe seems defeated, no longer attacking/ submitted to dokja in a way. The scenario doesn’t say kill the catastrophes, just to defeat them. I don’t see why the scenario has not been accomplished "
104,"Jun 15, 2022","Honestly, I'd have just gone, ""By the way...both of these scenarios say 'defeat', not 'kill'. Ms. Catastrophe, will you admit your defeat, and surrender? You will?! Well, you heard her! 200,000 coins, please."""
104,"Jun 15, 2022",Ayo. I really love Dokja and Bihyeong's chemistry.
104,"Jun 15, 2022",Is it possible that... WE'RE THE CONSTELLATIONS WATCHING ALL THIS HAPPEN THROUGH OUR PHONES AND GIFTING COINS TO GO AHEAD EPISODES?
104,"Jun 15, 2022",mid level dokkaebi? more like MID😥 SHUT UR BITCHASS UP BRO
104,"Jun 15, 2022","""Have you been thinking that far ahead already?""Dokja: ""Like whole series far ahead. I'm writing the continuation though."" "
104,"May 11, 2022",Haven't they technically cleared the scenario because the clear condition is too DEFEAT the catastrophe not KILL the catastrophe?
104,"Jun 16, 2022","""No one can understand! All my friends are dead!""Junghyeok: 😐😐😐😐😐😐"
104,"Jun 16, 2022",our brotha thicc
104,"Jun 16, 2022",Bro this would be a nasty place to stop at if someone was binge reading this
104,"Jun 16, 2022","Just to mention, if someone managed to complete the subscenario, they would ALSO complete the main scenario, so it woukd be tripple the original reward"
104,"Jun 16, 2022",the way this series is so addicting I literally have myself wrist pain from reading it in two sittings
104,"Jun 15, 2022","""line of good and evil is blurred right now"" this. this is what I love about in reading stories/ watching shows. this is the ultimate thing that makes a story the best for me."
104,"Jun 15, 2022",yjh really just delivers banger dialogue and then immediately leaves 😭😭 it's the protagonist effect 
104,"Jun 15, 2022","My subconscious while I've read this for the last idk how many chapters it's been- ""Huiwon Huiwon Huiwon Huiwon Huiwon Huiwon Huiwon Huiwon Huiwon Huiwon Huiwon Huiwon Huiwon"""
104,"Jun 15, 2022",Curious if anyone has considered rock paper scissors. Lol they didn't define defeat. Wouldn't that be a good work around? Lol 
104,"Jun 15, 2022","Boy, he read the story for YEARS! "
104,"Jun 15, 2022","I feel bad for those two,they're so lonely even staring at each other surrounded by people they're still by themselves 🥲id say thankfully dokja is there for them now but he literally has alone/dokja in his name 😂💔💔"
104,"Jun 15, 2022",that Dokkaebi can't do math. 1 quest that gives X reward and a second that gives 2x for same task actually triples what the person would get. 🤦
104,"Jun 15, 2022",YOU HAVE NO DAMN CLUE HOW MANY STPES AHEAD OF YOU HE IS. HE'S LAPPED YOU LONG AGO.
104,"Jun 15, 2022",personally I feel like defeat doesn't mean you have to kill like right now she looks defeated but I'm sure nobody really thinks about that 
104,"Jun 15, 2022","dokja living his fanfic dream life, exactly as he planned out? more likely than you think"
104,"Jun 15, 2022",his wide and lonely back ... this is the episode where yjh really took shape for me . kdj isn't ready yet to see beyond the fourth wall but the characters he knows still show themselves beyond it in ways I hadn't expected
104,"Jun 9, 2022",F your rules 😂
104,"May 12, 2022",You know if you think about it. The scenario just says to defeat the catastrophe. No where does it say kill her. Dojaka defeated her already. 
104,"May 11, 2022",I couldn't read this last night because I had a 102.6°F fever (39.2°C?) and damnit I'm so mad I got sick on a Tuesday night and had to wait almost 12 hours to read this chapter because it was so good. Of all the times to get sick😭
104,"May 11, 2022",i have a feeling that dokja has a plan for at least the next 10 years and he probably didn't include himself in that plan 
104,"May 11, 2022",The one who can feel her pain is junghyeok 😭
104,"May 11, 2022",I wouldn't be shocked if this gives Dokja a flood of coins as well.
104,"May 11, 2022",When Disaster!SYS realized that YJK is the only one who can really understand her grief T^T Just f-ing stab me! It’ll hurt less than this!
104,"May 11, 2022",DOKKAEBI CATCH UP WITH THE TIMES!! DoKjA iS aLwAyS oNe StEp AhEaD oF yOu
104,"May 11, 2022","Lee Jihye: What bullsht is this? // *everyone agrees* OKAY FINE, I ALSO AGREE"
104,"Jun 15, 2022","The Constellation [The Sadistic Chicken Lord] is happy about the continued suffering of the Mid-Level Dokkaebi because it keeps trying to ruin the fun, 1000 Coins have been gifted to the Incarnation [Dokja]"
104,"May 11, 2022","[Constellation ""Herald of the Black Dawn"" wants to hug those kids.]"
104,"Jun 22, 2022",“That damn mid-level dokkaebi” yes sir it is HIM
104,"Jun 20, 2022",“So quit pushing us” is the Korean equivalent of “Shut your damn trap you stupid human mutant goat”
104,"Jun 19, 2022",Dokja so drippy lmao
104,"Jun 17, 2022","why does defeat have to mean kill? Dokja clearly defeated her, but he didn't have to kill her to accomplish that. that dokaebi is getting on my last nerve 😤"
104,"Jun 16, 2022",I've been binging this series for the past hours and couldn't stop until I reached the last chapter... It's so good! How is Dokja able to think so critically and proceed with the right actions? I can't comprehend it at all. I guess he's that intelligent!
104,"Jun 16, 2022",in the very first episode he says that he'll eventually kill the consolations so keep that In mind 🤭
104,"Jun 16, 2022",Dokja defending his daughter 
104,"Jun 16, 2022",That dokaebi isn't aware that Dokja is playing the loooong game
104,"Jun 15, 2022","Yhe feeling when you are getting into it and it ends.
Just like that.AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
104,"Jun 15, 2022",Damn you Paul
104,"Jun 15, 2022","okay but like,,,, Dokja's waist."
104,"Jun 15, 2022","Dokja has a freaking fivehead, you really think a little subscenario is going to deter him?? "
104,"Jun 15, 2022",damn if i took a shot everytime the dokkaebi creat a subscenario just cuz dokja messed up lmao
104,"Jun 15, 2022",am i the only one who finds bihyeong so cute ( ꈍᴗꈍ)
104,"Jun 15, 2022",Always pulling impressive fits 👏👏👏
104,"May 11, 2022",Dokkaebi enjoy using the little between the lines stuff to their advantage but seems they cannot handle when the players are smart enough to do the same. Hypocrites 😆
104,"May 11, 2022",Imagine getting out played by a mere human 
104,"May 11, 2022",man do I hate the mid level dokkaebi
104,"May 12, 2022","[A Broke Weeb] has donated 5 coins. ""This God is satisfied. Any objections?"""
104,"Aug 19, 2022","in the webnovel, kdj goes on about yjh's big and lonely back in this chapter lmao"
104,"Jul 21, 2022",But the conditions were DEFEAT the catastrophe. You can win the fight and thus defeat her without killing her can't you?
104,"Jun 23, 2022",I can honestly say that I have never disliked a character as much as I dislike this dokkaebi in his tiny suite. I REALLY want to see him get a factory reset
104,"Jun 19, 2022","junghyeok rlly give me vibes like??yeah_i'm_cool_asf_look_at_me_bro_dokja.jpg
DTAJZYAJSH I CANT😭"
104,"Jun 19, 2022",But once again there is no time limit
104,"Jun 18, 2022",Kid sticking his tongue out to the Dokkaebi is my favorite part 🤣🤣💀
104,"Jun 18, 2022","dang, I really binged this whole thing 💀 "
104,"Jun 17, 2022",i...i catched up all the way..NOOOOO
104,"Jun 17, 2022","The scenario is to defeat, not kill. I’d say she’s been defeated rather thoroughly."
104,"Jun 17, 2022",I LOVE how the squad is so loyal and trusting of Dojka's choices 
104,"Jun 17, 2022",The dokkeabi are catching on to the fact that he knows something about the future but not to what extent
104,"Jun 17, 2022","The next chapter: Pay five coins and ur wishes to read this chapter may be fulfilled! 

Me: *Cry's in broke!*"
104,"Jun 16, 2022",let me just take to say that I don't have a plan on replacing orv on my top stories i have read. i just love and live for this i feel like crying
104,"Jun 16, 2022",“Unfortunate bastard” to Junghyeok Yu from Yuseung Shin. I understand you now.
104,"Jun 16, 2022",I just saw 3 orv angsts. My day is complete.
104,"Jun 16, 2022",help??? dokja in latest panel is soooooo prettty
104,"Jun 16, 2022",did Dokja still have that bounty on his head when Yuseung killed him? shouldn't she get that reward? 
104,"Jun 16, 2022",basically Yuseung this whole chapter : *surprised Pikachu face*
104,"Jun 16, 2022","I really want to comment about the chapter, but... Oh my, Dokja's waist on last panel 😳"
104,"Jun 16, 2022",kay but... why does junghyeok dress like a priest? anyone?
104,"Jun 16, 2022","joonghyuk's back that was the first time I found him attractive - ahem - also. the catastrophe was already defeated, hence no more issues. or is the word defeat a wrong translation?"
104,"Jun 16, 2022","Yeusung's face in the last panel; ""ok... but seriously... WHO TF IS HE!?!?"""
104,"Jun 16, 2022",biyheong start the ad
104,"Jun 16, 2022","Dokja might be in for a rude awakening of sorts next chapter.. And it does suck and put more things into perspective, That’s just my guess though cause things seem to be going a bit TOO well for him - Also I get the feeling the Japanese constellations Dokja tricked are still in Bihyeong’s channel waiting for Dokja to die again since he came back cause of the Immortal King ability so I think they’ll protest Dokja wanting to keep Future Yuseung alive just to be against him or something like that"
104,"Jun 16, 2022",I need more of this
104,"Jun 16, 2022","I love the brief moments in which we can see past all of Junghyeok's roughness and the reasons people dislike him, and instead get to see the reasons people love and understand him, regardless of his flaws"
104,"Jun 16, 2022",They just fought her and I'm pretty sure they all saw how badly their butts were kicked. There's no way they're dumb enough to try it again right?
104,"Jun 16, 2022","urgh this mud level dokkaebi can be really annoying at times... he should try role playing games ... once, our gm told us "" no you can't do that "" our answer was that yes we can't, but we had to because of the rules of the universes we were playing in, so we still managed to do it ( we weren't in the best shape at all in the end... ) "
104,"Jun 16, 2022",Wait so doesn't that mean they get 300 thousand coins if the kill the Catastrophe because they complete both Scenarios. I mean I might kill for 300 thousand webtoon coins
104,"Jun 16, 2022","Shocked they didn't mention how the scenario rules say DEFEAT not KILL. The definitions are completely different, with the first not requiring the second."
104,"Jun 16, 2022",Bold of me to assume that I can go out of this webtoon once I complete this chapter
104,"Jun 16, 2022",This dokkaebi is the definition of meddlesome just let dokja be the hero he’ll never think he is! 
104,"Jun 16, 2022",Bihyung nervous as a new teacher called to middle in teenagers fight hahaha
104,"Jun 15, 2022",FUCKKKKKKK I WANT TO KILL THAT LITTLE SHIT WITH MY BARE HANDS. Knowing what that shit Dokkaebi will do make my blood boil.
104,"Jun 15, 2022",sleepy c hitting us with that quality art
104,"Jun 15, 2022",just realised she just ripped her her whole arm off ?!#)@+@)@?!?!?

104,"Jun 15, 2022","That dokkaebi is so annoying. Personally, I wouldn’t let that slide"
104,"Jun 15, 2022",man honestly i can't wait for paul to get his ass beat
104,"Jun 15, 2022","Yes, Dokja is that far ahead of you that he calculated every possible outcome of a scenario. Why do you think he's still alive and kicking a**?"
104,"Jun 15, 2022","""lmao I'm 5 episodes past your understanding""- Dokja probably "
104,"Jun 15, 2022","welp I just learned to pay extra attention to detail. Also, I can't wait for Yuseung to learn that Dokja destroyed the Throne"
104,"Jun 15, 2022",........The bloody loopholes. Dokja I hope you have the plan because the lawyer floating goat-boy looks royally pissed and annoyed
104,"Jun 15, 2022","""Have you been thinking that far ahead already?"" he thinks further ahead than you could even dare to imagine"
104,"Jun 15, 2022","Nice to see that even though he destroyed the Throne everyone still learned the lesson: Dokja is the King of No Killing, his word is Law (and it NEVER turns out well for those who finish off monsters whom he spared). Thought that far ahead? All the way to the ending he wants to see, a world even a regressor with infinite chances failed to get: The Best End"
104,"Jun 15, 2022","""The only person in this world who understands her pain is..."" she finally realizes and now let's hope empathy stops violence"
104,"Jun 15, 2022","Love that the other kings are just straight up willing to back Dokja's decision on this despite not really knowing what's up. Our main man has left DEEP impressions on all of them, and the ripple effect from that has already become a tidal wave.
Also, Gilyeong's 'I can beat her up as much as she dis Titano' is sending me. The boy has no fear!"
104,"Jun 15, 2022",If she ends up having to die im ganna throw a fit
104,"Jun 15, 2022",I wonder if he’s talking about the constellations??  Also I love how Gilyeong still wants to punch her haha
104,"Jun 15, 2022",I enjoy how there's lowkey 2 main characters both dokja and the regressor are amazing protags 
104,"Jun 15, 2022",I hope Dokja will beat the shit out of that dokkaebi Paul
104,"Jun 15, 2022","""It was the first time I noticed that Yoo Joonghyuk's back was so big and wide. His back was wide and lonely."" <//3"
104,"Jun 12, 2022",Oh man you know what f*ck cocaine or whatever drug you got this. This. Right. Here. Is some class A adictive substance and every poor fool who fast passed with me can not deny me this.
104,"Jun 11, 2022",gilyoung is such a deadass mood lmfao 😭😭
104,"Jun 9, 2022",In addition to there being no time limit. The words are defeat the catastrophe not kill it. Make her admit defeat you win. hehe
104,"Jun 9, 2022","""Have you been thinking that far ahead? ""Have you just found out? 😂😂😂"
104,"May 17, 2022",I started this yesterday… I’m caught up… why…
104,"May 13, 2022","im waiting excitedly for the next episode, and im glad to see what looks like a kind of prequel to this being made. it looks good from what i read. "
104,"May 13, 2022","I wonder if Dokja will end up falling for someone, but decide to stay a respectable distance to keep the shipping Constellations guessing 🤔 It'd be funny if he acknowledged that idea."
104,"May 11, 2022",doesn't he win if she surrenders?
104,"May 11, 2022",the rules:  go left dokja:   no thanks. I'll stay here
104,"May 11, 2022",That dokkaebi needs to stop challenging dokja on Uno
104,"May 11, 2022",Noooo I want to read more😭
104,"May 11, 2022",The team just “Sit your dumbass down!!”
104,"May 11, 2022","Ah yes welcome to episode 103 of Dokja Kim, the walking maguffin "
104,"May 11, 2022", how does he notice these small details it's so unbelievable I love it and I need more
104,"May 11, 2022","I hope she comes out of this alive, she deserves a chance to live after all she went through."
104,"May 11, 2022",If I die you coming with me 🤣
104,"May 11, 2022",Can’t wait for the older version of herself can be a powerful ally for the crew🙂
104,"Sep 23, 2022",I was really thinking that the loophole was that refreshing doesn't mean killing but i guess Dokja's going with the time limit loophole... Wonder how that'll work out...
104,"Sep 18, 2022",I forgot everyone’s name except Dokja’s
104,"Aug 17, 2022","So all the timelines exist at the same time?? Bc if the 41st round YS is the catastrophe, that means that there wouldn’t have been a catastrophe before that. And if she was sent back in time?????? Like idk all the timelines are linked, right? So even if YJH regresses the timeline doesn’t completely vanish..?"
104,"Jul 29, 2022","in my opinion, them recruiting the Catastrophe (In a way) is defeating her. because she's no longer trying to destroy Seoul"
104,"Jul 7, 2022",i want to know.. how can we actually kill this irritating dokaebi? the one with the glasses on ofc...i want to slap him real bad 
104,"Jul 6, 2022",they are so loyal to kim dokja 😭
104,"Jun 25, 2022","Of course Dokja planned this all out, he knows everything. >:3"
104,"Jun 22, 2022",Defeat her in checkers. Or thumb wrestling if you can’t find a board.
104,"Jun 22, 2022",GILYOUNG GOT VIOLENT IN THE SHORT TIME HE WAS AWAY FROM DOKJA LMAO
104,"Jun 22, 2022",omg this is my first comment ever and I'm glad it's on this I'm looking forward to the next episode 
104,"Jun 21, 2022",...is this the Omniscient Reader equivalent of method overloading?
104,"Jun 21, 2022","they already defeated her, it never says kill, just defeat"
104,"Jun 21, 2022", kim dokja isn’t the strongest or the smartest but he has this power to lead people and to make them follow him and that’s what I love about him.
104,"Jun 20, 2022",did I read it too fast? I intentionally did not read this like for a month... and now I'm caught up
104,"Jun 19, 2022",Started reading this webtoon a few dsys ago and now it's my fav among all I'm currently reading 
104,"Jun 18, 2022",What an unlucky day to ran out of coins. Any constellations there who's willing to support me lol
104,"Jun 18, 2022","No, he's been READING that far ahead"
104,"Jun 17, 2022",Glad that the other Kings are still supporting THE king
104,"Jun 17, 2022",the squad majing and Avengers pose all around to protect yoseun. epic
104,"Jun 17, 2022",1) SHIT HOW DID I FORGET THE DAY OF THE WEEK AND MISS THIS I’M TWO DAYS LATE AAAAAA 2) I love how they all just agree to Dokja’s decision and back him up <3 they really do love him haha 3) can we burn this dokkaebi and punch him to the farthest corner of the universe please and thank you— 4) Dokja’s face when the dokkaebi appeared—I don’t think we’ve ever seen that facial expression on him before :0 he looks truly annoyed for the first time in this webtoon I think
104,"Jun 17, 2022",Mans just KNEW what was gonna happen.
104,"Jun 17, 2022","I’ll admit the fan art led me to the WEBTOON. It’s great. It’s really, really great!"

104,"Jun 16, 2022",It clearly says defeat not kill. Sir I would like to point out that the catastrophe's will was broken thus it is a mental defeat.
104,"Jun 16, 2022",bro i loved this istg
104,"Jun 16, 2022","Gee, I’ve never had top comment!"
104,"Jun 16, 2022",hahahah he has no idea HOW far ahead he is XD

104,"Jun 16, 2022",stop i started this yesterday what do you mean i’m all caught up-
104,"Jun 16, 2022","They have to defeat the catastrophe, not kill it. Just have the lady admit defeat, or renounce the title catastrophe of floods and therefore have defeated the catastrophe and gain the reward."
104,"Jun 16, 2022",I hope this Dokkaebi dies soon too🥰 can't stand that little sheep looking thing.
104,"Jun 16, 2022",I think we'll see a secound dokabi lose his powers soon enough
104,"Jun 16, 2022",dokja is so far ahead that bounce back!
104,"Jun 16, 2022","Yeah Dokja always thinking ahead, again with the dope chapter, Omni Reader👍"

104,"Jun 15, 2022",This man is literally their leader without him even realising it
104,"Jun 15, 2022","Dokja, as always, is playing advanced 4D chess"
104,"Jun 15, 2022",All it says is to DEFEAT the Catastrophe... not kill. There are plenty of ways of defeating someone and keeping them alive at the same time
104,"Jun 15, 2022","ahhh there's this line that i really like from the novel, when yjh said to shin yoosung ""If you want, I will bear your hatred."" i remember it got me ugly crying lol"
104,"Jun 15, 2022",i really thought he was going to go with the whole defeat =\= kill thing
104,"Jun 15, 2022","Well, you don't have to kill someone to defeat them. So they could actually keep her alive and complete the main scenario"
104,"Jun 15, 2022","I mean, the scenario talks about defeating, not killing. If she surrenders, she is effectively defeated."
104,"Jun 15, 2022","This dokkaebi would be pissed to know just how far ahead Dokja's plans are... Unrelated, but I'm glad Junghyeok gave that talk. Regressor to pseudo-regressor(?). I got the impression that he understood why Yuseung hates him (makes sense why he walked away, probably bc she wouldn't actually want to see him). "
104,"Jun 15, 2022",I don't get it....is the Catastrophe from the 41st round or the 2nd round ? Please someone explain it in simple words....😭
104,"Jun 15, 2022",Give these chapters some love! The art is fantastic and I cant keep coming back for the story. Thank you author!!!

104,"May 14, 2022","okay but all I can think about is his friend who can make copies of herself and how when he left she was watching and bummed out that he didn't even look for her. like, dokja makes big friend mistakes too"
104,"May 13, 2022","Hm... So Yuseung and Junghyeok are functionally like the Doctor and River Song? She started at his 41st regression, while he started at his first (obviously), the two of which are moving toward opposing ends of their stories. Junghyeok doesn't know the terrible things he will put her, and others through, when he's given up hope, and she's painfully aware, and wants revenge. She warned him, in the second regression, but like most heroes, he's too dense to listen, and gets himself killed, here..."
104,"May 12, 2022",The dokkaebi looking more and more human as the story progresses. Could this be a bit of visual metaphor or perhaps foreshadowing?
104,"May 12, 2022","all she has to do is say ""I admit defeat dokja. you beat me"" because the scenario says defeat, not kill"

104,"Jun 22, 2022",I have a feeling than Junghyeok has far more regressions and the number he shows is to keep his two information hidden. that's why he was familiar with the catastrophe girl and maybe.. just maybe.. he always knew Dokja and knew he was an ally as strong as him but by trial and error knew that only get stronger by letting him travel in his own like he does with the shield guy?

There is a mild spoiler after this so please stop reading if you don’t want that.    Unfortunately the majority of the constellations don’t send indirect messages. He does not have the whole picture here and he will realize that in the next chapter.

Episode,Date,Review
110,"Jun 22, 2022","Everyone needs to know that Dokja hit Paul exactly 124 times, spending 62,000 coins just for a good beating. 🤩💫"
110,"Jun 22, 2022",HADES SOON HADES SOON HADES SOON. I CAN'T WAIT OMG 
110,"Jun 22, 2022",Awh.. I wanted to see Paul get knocked around some more 😭
110,"Jun 22, 2022","I am to explain that the catastrophe Shin Yoosung was handed by a great demon to the dokkaebis, in the course of the transfer, the strings of the contract were created using the great demon's power. But the flames of hell were deeply embedded in her body, burning her vitality to extinguish all evil. Uriel's stigma was a fire that never burned out until all the evil was gone. As the contract was made out of 'evil' it was burned in the process, making the contract terminated."
110,"Jun 22, 2022",Hmm...I like the term 'deeply embarrassed' more than the term 'flustered' for the Prisoner of the Golden Headband's reaction to Kim Dokja returning the sponsored coins.
110,"Jun 22, 2022",does anyone remember lazy broke weeb?? and Neptune's if so pay 5 coins to   give gratitude to there service as veteran readers.
110,"Jun 22, 2022","I think the reason Sangah figured about Dokja's plan quickly is because of the story of Orpheus, who visited the Underworld in order to revive his wife Eurydice, it's a famous myth in South Korea. And seeing that some details seem to match with Shin Yoosung...yeah, that's it. "
110,"Jun 22, 2022","I love that dokja was like “weeeew, glad their gone cause now I’m gonna REALLY do something that’ll upset them!”"
110,"Jun 22, 2022","Sun Wukong wanted to give him more money JUST to see that punk get hit some more, and I can appreciate that!"
110,"Jun 22, 2022","[Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" is disappointed that the webtoon did not show Kim Dokja beat the living sh*t out of Paul.]"
110,"Jun 22, 2022",Wukong really paid this man to keep going. Bless that monkey's heart.
110,"Jun 22, 2022","I wonder, is he really doing all this because he just cared about and didn't want Yuseung to die, or is it because he could actually really use or need her for his plans? It seems like he just really cared about what happened to her emotionally, but it's also so hard to tell with him sometimes and I know he wants to craft a story, so she must play into the story he wants to tell somehow. (Either the original story he read he's trying to get the same end or maybe even to get a new ending.)"
110,"Jun 22, 2022","EXCUSE ME, BUT WHAT DOES THAT ""Did you bribe them?"" MEAN WHEN DOKJA SAID IT? IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DOKJA ASKING BIHYUNG IF HE RETURNED ALL THE DONATIONS??? WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN"
110,"Jun 22, 2022",Those tears in Yoosung's eyes 🥺
110,"Jun 22, 2022","Lately, every single chapter has some freaking amazing art! it's gorgeous to look at. that scene where the main group were watching Paul getting dragged away? glorious "
110,"Jun 22, 2022","If Dokja does manage to bring back catastrophe Yuseung, will we have two precious Yuseungs in the party? 🥺 Just imagine the possibilities "
110,"Jun 22, 2022",Dokja if he were a reader rn: The chances of getting a top comment after 30 mins is impossible. Also Dokja: But there's still a chance 
110,"Jun 22, 2022",FATHER OF THE RICH NIGHT LET'S GOOOOOOO!!!!!
110,"Jun 22, 2022",tbh i was expecting a nice reunion with huiwon but hey our boy is busy so i’ll wait
110,"Jun 22, 2022","Yep, I’ve been looking for something like this. Nothings hit the spot since solo leveling. This is epic"
110,"Jun 22, 2022","What's does ""pour soul"" mean? Is it supposed to be poor? Yes, that's it."
110,"Jun 22, 2022","""As expected, the demons handed the dokkaebi Beast Lord Shin Yoosung"" that's grammatically incorrect 😔"
110,"Jun 22, 2022",I hope they take the bait by next chapter
110,"Jun 22, 2022",whose ready for him to Trick hades
110,"Jul 27, 2022","""I'll leave the channel open, so don't cause any trouble while I'm gone. Please"" hahaha the glare he gives him tho, such a parent"
110,"Jul 27, 2022","haha, i love how bihyeong was like, “i’m leaving now, okay? *don’t do anything stupid, you fucker.*” and dokja was like, “now that you’re gone, i’ll be doing *everything* stupid.”"
110,"Jun 22, 2022","Sun Wu Kong just tried help the crowdfunding of bearing up Paul to a pulp, but my man Dokja just refused because his actions now are righteous | (Well not that he didn't captalize more moral with his constelations supporters in the process...)"
110,"Jun 22, 2022",so I see comments and now I'm thinking there's an IQ battle between the cosmos beings and man. who's gonna win this test? 
110,"Jun 22, 2022",Forgot about this arc coming up tbh buts its a great arc nonetheless
110,"Jun 22, 2022",YES BRING HEE BACK PLEASE. Also hell yeah I'm so glad Paul got his ass kicked
110,"Jun 22, 2022",[<Second Promise> application sequence initiated] 🙂
110,"Jun 22, 2022","how like how Hades is the ""father of the rich night"", night referring to his rule over the underworld and rich meaning that he's also the god of money."
110,"Jul 27, 2022",sangah stop being hot challenge
110,"Jul 27, 2022","Damn. Tbh, we are literally constellations who seek entertainment over people's suffering. Can't help but feel a bit disgusted of myself lol At least they are fiction."
110,"Jul 27, 2022","""But humans find the purpose of life in pointless things like this"" daaaamn... But he's right tho, we're all about emotions"
110,"Jun 22, 2022","I just realized Paul is every movie studio/producer. something deep and rich is happening in the story, something dramatic, something wonderful. instead of letting it grow, he crushes it down to be nothing more than another churned out meat-fest, a copy of every other mediocre stream/movie/show."
110,"Jul 27, 2022",is it only me cuz i really preferred demon-like judge of fire over demonic judge of fire. i feel like it makes a huge difference in how readers perceive both the way it was explained in the novel yk. 
110,"Jul 27, 2022",this man gets attractive every ep
110,"Jun 22, 2022","I NEED HER BACK ALIVE, I'M CRYING MYSELF TO SLEEP UNTIL SHE RESURRECTS."
110,"Jul 27, 2022",Oh yes… I can’t wait for this next arc! Where Dokja gets to meet *[g̸͕̃͝a̷̘̖͒r̴͖͋͝ͅb̷͉̈́͜l̴̻̈ȩ̸̮̃d̸̡̯̒̒ ̷̡̡́c̸̳̻̅͘e̶̠̹̊̉n̸̨̹̐ș̷̒o̵͛ͅr̵̙͎͆s̶̘̄h̷̫͙̄͊i̵̡͖̿p̶̼̅̑͜]* !!!

110,"Jun 22, 2022",ADOPTION ARC ADOPTION ARC ADOPTION ARCFOR 41!SYS AND DOKJA.
110,"Jul 29, 2022","How is this not the top action, it’s better than teenage mercenary, don’t mean to hate but seriously. Edited:And the reason why is bc, when I was reading teenage mercenary it was really good but you don’t feel as excited, this Webtoon actually makes me feel something."
110,"Jul 27, 2022",So was everybody able to see Dokja beat Paul or no? Cuz it seemed that way to me lol. Thought it was a private meeting.

110,"Jul 28, 2022",[Constellation Stormy Ram King demands for more Paul's ass-whooping time]
110,"Jul 27, 2022","I wish people would stop comparing this to the novel. This is a visual interpretation of a book, just like a movie can be a visual interpretation. Some things will be cut, some things will be kept in. Some of the things cut may be scenes that you liked in the original novel but for whatever reason this author cut it, either way, it’s still a good piece of work and I don’t think it detracts at all from the main story, plot, or sentiments coming through "
110,"Jul 27, 2022",Not the Enforcers making fun of Paul LOL I'm always Touched by Dokja's action for his Comrades ㅠ ㅠ
110,"Jul 27, 2022",I was hoping for a 7-page Muda beat down of Paul
110,"Jul 27, 2022","Actually, if he just asked Hades would bring someone back to life for a good, dramatic story about them. worked for Hercules..."
110,"Jul 27, 2022",Dokja is like 40 steps ahead of everyone in the story at all times

110,"Sep 8, 2022",damn the enforcer's reaction to Paul's face is gold
110,"Aug 10, 2022",i keep forgetting that dokkaebi’s name is Paul. whenever i see the name paul in the comments i j imagine this old white dad in a polo and khakis. 
110,"Aug 6, 2022",DAAAMN. You know it's personal when Dokja straight up refunds the gifted money. Sheeeesh. I teared up when I saw Yuseung's teary face as Dokja made her that promise 😭

110,"Jul 29, 2022",so is he basically having the constellations bully hades into talking to him like a twitter spam?
110,"Jul 28, 2022",Not me imagining Dokja summoning Hades from Lore Olympus… *pat pat*
110,"Jul 28, 2022",the episodes just getting shorter and shorter
110,"Jul 28, 2022",bae dokja always been the sassiest slay 😝
110,"Jul 28, 2022",My man dokja just spent a fortune on a beating💫🤩
110,"Jul 28, 2022",Hades you say?
110,"Jul 28, 2022",When they think some measly coins will stop you from laying a finger on them:
110,"Jul 28, 2022",We need a filler episode where it's just Dokja beating the crap out of Paul for several panels 😂😂
110,"Jul 28, 2022",yeah- F you paul
110,"Jul 28, 2022",I know it's not there but ill imagine the noise of Paul getting kicked is that of a squish squeaky toy😂
110,"Jul 28, 2022","I hope they don't make Hades an evil asshole like he's typically portrayed, in fact he is one of the most reasonable Greek gods"
110,"Jul 28, 2022",OMG HADES!!!! AHH I CANT WAIT TO SEE HIM AND PERSEPHONE INTERACT WITH DOKJA!!!!
110,"Jul 27, 2022","That ass whooping was so satisfying. 😌 And Dokja just being like, ""You ain't gotta pay me, this fade is on the house."" 😂"
110,"Jul 27, 2022","Thank you author and artist, for another wonderful piece of work!"
110,"Jul 27, 2022",[The poor ass constellation feels sad that they can't get 5 coins. He decided to reread it for fun]
110,"Jul 27, 2022","""now there's no one to object what I'm doing next"" mans never planned to do things by the rules and they're just in the way "
110,"Jul 27, 2022","God I hope this works out, I want two versions of Yuseung in the crew lol. Can we get our sappy reunion with Huiwon tho, she showed up to save the day but we haven’t talked to her without shit going down yet! "

110,"Jul 27, 2022",Dokja petting yuseungs head 🥺 dokja ilysm
110,"Jul 27, 2022",UGSHAHSHAHD IM SO HYPED FOR THE NEXT ARC LETS GOOOOOOO
110,"Jul 27, 2022",if you want to think about something really terrifying remember this. odds are that coin amount we were shown last episode was probably after he gave Mr. White the coins to bribe the guards. so he likely had even more.
110,"Jul 27, 2022","Didn't someone comment last week that that panel of Dokja was poetic in the novel, that he was communicating his feelings with Yuseung... Well, ""I'm gonna beat that damn dokkaebi to a pulp"" doesn't sound really poetic but I'm not complaining"
110,"Jul 27, 2022",You already lost heheeee-punch-
110,"Jul 27, 2022",aww bihyeong looked so sad while he was leaving for administration 
110,"Jul 27, 2022",also kdj looks so freaking hot with yoosung's beast king transformation 
110,"Jul 27, 2022","Ah, so it was never about getting an audience with Hades. It was about the Constellations *knowing* he wanted an audience with Hades. Also, gotta give it to Son Wukong. He knew exactly what the penalty was, and wanted to gift Dokja a free punch."
110,"Jul 27, 2022",why do I feel like the episodes are getting shorter😭
110,"Jul 27, 2022",The Underworld part is one of the best in my booklist
110,"Jul 27, 2022",Oh no he’s going to pull an Orpheus XD
110,"Jul 27, 2022",The fact that some Constellations were willing to pay to watch Paul get his ass beat 💀 Let’s go boys 😂
110,"Jul 27, 2022",Damn dokja is the king of negotiations and asking for meetings always. Just going around asking people to meet him so that he can scam them. 
110,"Jul 27, 2022","I have been reading this for 2 days and I'm caught up. But I was obsessed with this story since I started it. In fact, got so obsessed with the story that I haven't put my phone down. I am excited to see what this story has to offer."
110,"Jul 27, 2022",It's gonna take a really long time to meet him but aaaa!!! First panel of best father<3
110,"Jul 27, 2022",*Viking God of Rock donated 500 coins in an attempt to continue the beating of Paul*
110,"Jul 27, 2022",Can we get a Lore Olympus crossover?
110,"Jul 27, 2022",Plot getting thicker than a bowl of oatmeal! Gott damn!
110,"Jul 27, 2022",ah refreshing to see an a-hole get what he deserves
110,"Jul 27, 2022","I wonder what we will see from hades in the next few episodes,from the myths that I know of hades is a rather charitable man,however retrieving a soul comes with rules and otherwise if you break them even the slightest bit the soul will stay in the underworld forever"
110,"Jul 27, 2022",the only bad thing about this about this episode is that it ended-
110,"Jul 27, 2022",this is better than solo leveling 
110,"Jul 24, 2022",I WISH HADES WILL APPEAR I CAN'T WIATTTT TO SEE HIM
110,"Jul 24, 2022",Thanks to the author for making this master piece 🥹🙏🏻
110,"Jul 21, 2022",I wonder how many constellations are there in total? I'm also curious as to what penalities you would get for trying to bring someone back from the dead? 
110,"Jul 20, 2022",The art in this story is fantastic. I am aware we're nowhere close to the end but with each chapter I get more excited to reach the ending that Dokja is planning. 
110,"Jul 13, 2022",IS IT BAD TO LAUGH WHILE OUR DOKJA HERE IS BEATING PAUL TO PULP? 😭 
110,"Jun 24, 2022",I don’t know if it’s already been explained or not but is participation in the scenarios optional? 
110,"Jun 24, 2022",HAPPY FATHER’S DAY to the BEST FATHER coming soon!!! It’s HADES TIME BABEYYY
110,"Jun 24, 2022",Daddy Hades is in the chat!

110,"Aug 14, 2022",cant wait for dokja to meet his adoptive parents ;>
110,"Aug 6, 2022","Dokja is the new protagonist of this twsa, cause I understand why they somehow hates Junghyeok. That bastard is too emotionless😂"
110,"Aug 5, 2022","the panel where they showed yuseung crying, its soo beautifully sad?? like idk her expressions are so sincere..idk the word for it but yes u understand me :)"
110,"Aug 3, 2022",it's so disappointing that they cut the beat up part
110,"Aug 2, 2022",imagine reading 109 Of these chapters in one sitting🙃
110,"Aug 2, 2022","I just caught up with the series and I am still in awe of how good it is!!! Definitely my favorite webtoons, I'm so glad someone recommended it to me!"
110,"Aug 2, 2022",BIHYUNG😭💖
110,"Aug 1, 2022",I already imagine when I was reading a novel ver and I can finally see the action in the webtoon 😌that was satisfying to see Dokja sexy kick to punish that Paul 😘🤌
110,"Aug 1, 2022",I have no coin's 😭
110,"Jul 31, 2022",DAD HADES IS COMING!!! 🤧
110,"Jul 30, 2022",lol Dokja is the best
110,"Jul 30, 2022",i think i’m too dumb to keep up with everything that’s going on lmao 
110,"Jul 29, 2022",They need to get better translators for this webtoon. Everything about it is A+ but is all being  undermined by the shitty translations
110,"Jul 29, 2022",HEIDJSLAKSHKSKD COINS I NEED COINS
110,"Jul 29, 2022",NOOOOOO I DON'T HAVE NO MORE COOINNSS

110,"Jul 28, 2022",i can’t believe i alr caught up
110,"Jul 28, 2022","[The Constellation BBlovesdragons is intrigued by the turn of events, this constellation encourages you to keep going]"

110,"Jul 28, 2022","Meanwhile Hades from Lore Olympus sneezes... Hades: ""Hmmmm, someone is talking about me"""
110,"Jul 28, 2022",So how many coins did dokja spent to beat the crap out of Paul?
110,"Jul 28, 2022",Promise #1 Beat the crap out of Paul: Complete. Promise #2 Bring Beast Lord Yuseung back: Work in Progress. Promise #3 ??? : unknown
110,"Jul 28, 2022","I'M LATE AGAINN 😭😭 But this chapter!!! Brilliant. We see the promise that Dokja told Yuseung before she disappeared, and the lengths he's going to get her back. We also see Paul (IM STILL NOT OVER THAT) getting the punishment he deserves (and a good beating <3) and Dokja running wild now that Bihyeong's gone 💀 the art's as beautiful as always and i can't wait to see what this new arc brings! :)"
110,"Jul 28, 2022",Dormamu ive come to bargain
110,"Jul 28, 2022",This is the time where I'm mad I don't have money for coins. Gotta rely on free coins from webtoon

110,"Sep 25, 2022",Ohh finely Paul got what he deserves!!! I can’t wait to see Heads and what will happen!!! 
110,"Sep 24, 2022","Dokja is really dangerous. You never know if he is being genuine for saving a lot of the characters or if he is doing so because he has an ulterior motive. I can never read him. If you observe closely, all the characters around him have some purpose for his goal: Jihye, Sangah, Gilyeong, Yuseung etc. This time, what could really be his purpose for wanting to revive Yuseung to the extent of possibly making enemies with Hades himself? Is it only pity and concern or for an entirely selfish reason?"
110,"Sep 24, 2022",Sheesh he’s going so far for her. It’s sweet tbh but it’ll cause unnecessary stress 😭

110,"Jul 27, 2022",😭
110,"Jul 27, 2022",what would’ve been hilarious would have been if there was a crossover where it was like hades from lore olympus in that smaller frame. no where near as much doom and gloom but the humor would have been there. i do know that this is a retelling of a comic so it can’t really be changed so his personality as portrayed in other webtoons would not have carried over sadly
110,"Jul 27, 2022","he complicated things but i guess it's only fair coz he needs pernission from Hades to enter the other world.. seriously thought he was going to use Ariadne because.. labrynth u know 😅 so it does not matter if yuseong soul goes missing he could use the string to find her. Not that i pictured it easy, but, less burocratic 😋"

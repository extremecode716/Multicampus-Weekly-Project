Episode,Date,Review
105,"May 18, 2022","""it's ok, go ahead and kill me"" I'm sobbing 😭"
105,"May 18, 2022",[The genre of the scenario has been set to 'Tragedy']... 😢
105,"May 18, 2022",dokja kim back must be hurting and aching for carrying the whole scenario 
105,"May 18, 2022","I REALLY like this episode, it shows that Dokja isn’t as powerful or as smart as he pretends to be, and it shows his arrogance, something we have been kind of blind to.  It’s a bit refreshing"
105,"May 18, 2022","So the ""real"" Yoosung is still conscious inside her controlled body. What an awful feeling that must be, to be aware but not in control. 😭"
105,"May 18, 2022",The mid-level Dokkaebi has now become the worst character in this entire webtoon. 
105,"May 18, 2022","Woahh that shot of Dokja with beast king skill… it’s things like this that make me appreciate the webcomic format. Plus, the shot itself is beautiful"
105,"May 18, 2022",Jihye’s “why me!” just gets me😂
105,"May 18, 2022","Dokja may have miscalculated but he's still the omniscient reader. He still has knowledge that not even the constellations have, and he's still in the right. Turn it up and turn it on them Dokja!"
105,"May 18, 2022",I like how Dokja doesn’t get endless plot armor it’s a nice change to most of the mangas or animes I watch. It shows how fallible anyone can be even someone that seems infallible.
105,"May 18, 2022",Guess there's a limit to Dokja's scamming spree huh
105,"May 18, 2022",I just cant with that mid level dokkaebi and i wish him the worst  ʘ‿ʘ
105,"May 18, 2022","So three things. 1) Once again, excellent, action-packed episode 🙌🏻  2) How traumatizing this whole ordeal must be for young Yuseung, especially if the poor girl is to witness the death of her older self (though, hopefully, older Yuseung will only be stopped and be able to move on) 3) In retrospect, I’m kinda glad that Dokja had no choice but to pick this white coat, it makes for a strikingly beautiful beast transformation 👌🏻"
105,"May 18, 2022",Noooo she could have such a good redemption arc! She shouldn’t have to die!
105,"May 18, 2022","Yo, shout-out to that one constellation named [Eyes waiting for Tuesday night] he the realest 😭"
105,"May 18, 2022","Man, this is just sad. The fact that they're forced to kill her is tragic, but it makes sense that not all constellations were on board with his plan. I guess I can only wait hope Dokja finds another way around this... "
105,"May 18, 2022","I appreciate the Chekhov's Guns that the author picks back up periodically, it allows the main character to work for their victories in an unexpected way instead of it being a boring pubstomp every time. ALSO WAIFU SKILL ACTIVATE"
105,"May 18, 2022",PLEASE LIVE I STG MY HEART CAN'T HANDLE THIS😭😭HER SAYING IT'S OKAY JUST BROKE ME. THAT FCKING STUPID MID LEVEL BTCH😤🤬
105,"May 18, 2022","good lord, when he activated that skill and the image of his cost flowing into wings. Gorgeous art once again. "
105,"May 18, 2022",Still wait to see if Dokja can stop this by using the Contract he made with her in the past to overwrite the control they have over her future self.
105,"May 18, 2022","Oh that's genius, in forcing Yuseung to fight, the dokkaebi locked her into the evil alignment. Now that he's swapped his bookmark to Huiwon he can use time of judgement and it literally can't fail to activate because she's been forced to evil. I'll be sad to see her go but it's an excellent countermove on Dokjas part."
105,"May 18, 2022",Anyone else really wanna see another Dokkaebi get slugged into space now?
105,"May 18, 2022","I feel bad for shin, she don’t deserve this, she been through enough torture"
105,"May 18, 2022","Ahh, makes sense, with a forcibly set ""evil"" nature, Huiwon's judgment skill will be highly effective. "
105,"May 18, 2022",I miss lazy broke weeb :'(
105,"May 18, 2022",I’m so sad for her 🥺💔 But I do like that We are shown that Dokja is not infallible. Like he’s super smart and op which is awesome but nice that we have a moment where he’s wrong. Just sad that it’s at the expense of this poor girl who was about to have a moment of redemption 😭😭😭💔
105,"May 18, 2022","poor dokja, it's really his first time experiencing a failure like this and it's going to cost someone their life😭"
105,"May 18, 2022","what a tragic end, i really hoped that the catastrophe would’ve been able to stay for a bit longer but in the grand scheme of things it wasn’t possible )^:"
105,"May 18, 2022",even a evil person may have a set of morals. He changed her to evil not chaotic evil plus Dokja may have a backup plan.
105,"May 18, 2022",I will never stop giving money to this Webtoon.
105,"May 18, 2022",ok but Dokja protecting Yuseung got me in the feels 😭 my man's fully embraced the single dad life
105,"Jun 22, 2022","""It's okay, go ahead and kill me""  I remember I saw someone say that orv was all fun and games until the 100th ep and this hurts more than I expected "
105,"Jun 8, 2022",Prisoner of the golden headband is such a firm Dokja Supporter! 
105,"Jun 22, 2022","Forcing Yuseung's alignment change into to evil... That's just f*cking heartless. To die like that, after gaining some hope... I hope present Yuseung won't have to go through anything like this "
105,"Jun 22, 2022",who else want to punch that dokkaebi? 
105,"Jun 22, 2022","As a few of you already said, Dokja's arrogance made him underestimate the constellation. He forgot that not all of them are the same and easily manipulated or swayed by his tricks. This is a hugh fall back, it also made the constellation cautious of him, so future tricks might be harder to pull of. But, it also reminded Dokja, who he is dealing with, he now knows, he has to step up his game. This would have happened sooner or later, but now he can learn from it. but at what cost..."
105,"Jun 22, 2022",[The Constellation “The Lost Wanderer” is not pleased by what the dokkabi have done]
105,"Jun 22, 2022",Jihye carrying gilyoung 😭❤️
105,"Jun 22, 2022","That ""go ahead and kill me"" hit me right in the feels.. Yuseung was hopeful of the current scenario and had that hope torn away from her. It's hitting Dokja heavy too because he failed her. But it looks like he doesn't intend to give up so easily on his plan. I wonder what he's planning on doing with the Judge of Evil Huiwon."
105,"Jun 22, 2022",HIS CAPE OMG WINGS!!!!
105,"May 18, 2022",So all in favor of voting the mid grade jerk out of the scenario? Yes?
105,"May 19, 2022",with great fast pass comes great debt
105,"May 18, 2022","as a binge reader I don't usually spend coins but this one is a drug, I need MOOORREEE"
105,"May 18, 2022","So sad. I hope he pulls off a great turnaround. Keep up the great chapters, this is my favorite weekly read! "
105,"Jun 22, 2022",that beautiful panel of kdj's coat flowing and morphed into wings-thingy gives me strong tsubasa reservoir chronicle vibes (or just clamp vibes in general) 😳
105,"May 18, 2022",Sooooo me and this mid level Dokkaebi are about to fight…. For multiple reasons… 🥊
105,"May 18, 2022",this is literally so sad 😭😭
105,"Jun 22, 2022",GILYOUNG BEING FORCEFULLY GRABBED AND KDJ WITH GOLDEN EYES AAAAAA
105,"Jun 22, 2022",I always hated this part the moment I read the novel. Paul you absolute a**hole
105,"Jun 22, 2022","Not the “it’s ok, go ahead and kill me”🥺😭"
105,"Jun 24, 2022",I CALLED IT! THERE WAS NO WAY NONE OF TUE CONSTELLATIONS NOTICED THE MAXIMUM SUB COUNT. SOMEONE WOULD TRY TO SUBSCRIBE BUT THEY WOULDN’T BE ABLE TO AFTER THE MAXIMUM 🤦‍♀️
105,"Jun 23, 2022",Where is Lazy Broke Weeb?? Tragedy
105,"Jun 22, 2022",This arc was the first time I cried during the novel and it definitely wasn't the last ... Even though I already know what happens it's still a punch in the gut ;;
105,"Jun 22, 2022",this need to be an anime 😩
105,"May 19, 2022",Constellations really just watching a whole YT stream lol
105,"May 19, 2022",Fml she even gave up and wanted him to kill her I bet she is suppressing most of her skills so she is just rampaging with her most basic skills..😭
105,"Jun 23, 2022","Can you hand over that mid-level dokkaebi for a moment? I swear, I just want to talk. "
105,"Jun 23, 2022","you know the author is doing a good job when your heart just plummets while your reading.I honestly didn't see this coming and realizing that the constilations were fully aware of what Dokja was doing,weren't being manipulated by him,and were just letting him get away with it because it amused them was a massive shock."
105,"Jun 22, 2022",I wanna see that Dokkabei suffer
105,"Jun 22, 2022",Sentiments of the Beast King? really? Beast King's Sensitivity makes way more sense
105,"Jun 22, 2022","""... The majority of constellations have agreed to the plausibly of this change in direction"" no! How could you agree to something like that?! I don't like the constellations anymore"
105,"Jun 23, 2022",its so refreshing to see dokja struggling a little. not everything is going to go his way & i like how the scripting made it look like he was going to succeed at the start. it’s like a nice reminder that we’re experiencing this story from dokja’s pov & that there are so many perspectives we dont get to see
105,"Jun 22, 2022",I was rereading earlier today and I'm pretty sure the exact words said from yoosung here match what younger yoosung was saying earlier when they told her about the catastrophe...
105,"Jun 22, 2022",this is just the beginning of TRAGEDY
105,"Jun 22, 2022","One of the constellation names of the screen torwards the beginning is ""Eyes Waiting for Tuesday Night."" Haha I too am waiting for Tuesday night for this webtoon. "
105,"May 20, 2022",finally caught up wish I didnt
105,"May 19, 2022",I'm a bit sad about how it's turning out for her but at the same time I'm very happy Dokja scheme are not working all the times
105,"May 18, 2022","dam, fucking cunt. that shit was wack. did her dirty. she just wanted peace "
105,"May 18, 2022",FU-CK PAUL. All my homies hate Paul. 🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼
105,"Jun 22, 2022","[Constellation ""Storm Of Dragons"" is not pleased with the Dokkaebi]"
105,"Jun 29, 2022","refreshing to see dokja falter tbh, finally he seems like a human, albeit a super smart one"
105,"Jun 24, 2022",jihye may be the funniest character 
105,"Jun 23, 2022",so when will twitch.tv/bihyeong.com become a thing
105,"Jun 23, 2022",crying sobbing
105,"Jun 23, 2022",HES GOT THE WINGS
105,"Jun 23, 2022",Awesome art scene where his cloke resembles wings or feathers and he's protecting the girl.
105,"Jun 22, 2022","I remember hating everything in this arc and crying like a bitch here. Rereading it in manhwa form is no better, I'm still crying so much :(("
105,"Jun 22, 2022",Huiwon!?! My lord.. I miss her so much... just bring her back already 
105,"Jun 22, 2022",You kill me with these cliff hangers 😭
105,"Jun 22, 2022","I'm really in awe for the story this webtoon has man its just on a whole another level its characters, their development, world setting, esp. our M.C and this brilliant plot with just the right amount of twist and turn. its pace and how the way thing turn out will always something I'll look forward to. and also a great shot out to the artist as well. kudos to all the creators involved in making this webtoon, and lastly thanks to webtoon for  making it available"
105,"Jun 22, 2022",WE MUST KILL THAT MID LEV DOKKABI! WHOS WITH ME!?
105,"Jun 22, 2022",[A constellation who hates his fellows is sneering and threatening to leave.]
105,"Jun 22, 2022",NO NO NO NO FUUUUCK
105,"Jun 22, 2022","Well he’s gonna get 100,000 coins for defeating her so I want to say it’s a win, but she was such a good charcter! Uggh constellations, why y’all like violence so much?"
105,"Jun 22, 2022",I'm impressed at the rate Dokja adapts. Several chapters ago he couldn't learn a skill and didn't think of using bookmark to use the skill for several hours or even days. And now he not just only used two skills to help the situation but choose the one that can change opinion of constellations towards the Catastrophe. I mean if Huiwon's judgment doesn't consider the Catastrophe evil it won't damage her. It must prove something to constellations and it's what Dokja wants. 
105,"Jun 22, 2022",If the implications have been that the readers are similar to the constellations then does that mean most readers would rather have an action packed fight rather than Dokja saving Yuseung? Noooo I refuse to believe this!
105,"Jun 22, 2022",SCREW THE CONSTELLATIONS!!!
105,"Jun 22, 2022",I want to see dokja max out his mana. because I want to see him using that sentiment of the beast king and way of the wind and bookmark simultaneously with his sword and sword song active too because I think that would be an amazing power up sequence 
105,"May 20, 2022","ahh. does anyone else kinda feel like a bad constellation? I mean, we are literally paying coins to watch these scenarios play out. and the scenarios are written and portrayed in order for us to want to pay for them. I may be being a hypocrite, but I kinda feel bad at the same time. even though I know this isn't real."
105,"Aug 1, 2022",Props to Jihye thinking about Gilyeong’s safety 
105,"Jul 30, 2022",I swear to all of the gods I will kill that Dokkaebi if I can 
105,"Jun 29, 2022","OR has such amazing female characters. They all have wonderful personalities and capabilities, and none of them are drawn in objectified ways. Like Yuseung, I’ve noticed monster-like female characters of her type in other action comics are typically drawn with so much emphasis to their body that it’s frankly creepy. But OR draws each character with respect and each character carries the narrative."
105,"Jun 28, 2022",I’ve spent 2 sleepless nights catching up and I’m glad I did 
105,"Jun 24, 2022","*Starts looking for lazy broke weeb's comment*(also brb crying at ""its ok go ahead and kill me)"
105,"Jun 24, 2022",just wanted to say BEST STORY EVER I'm in love 😭❤
105,"Jun 24, 2022",lmao Jihye scooping Gilyeong like a sack of potatoes 
105,"Jun 23, 2022","Ah, learkers, people who read the Webtoon but don't comment. (people like me)"
105,"Jun 23, 2022",i finally caught up with everything and am soooo sad! why does she need to die? :( she didn't need to die
105,"Jun 23, 2022",Really starting to hate that Dokkaebi
105,"Jun 23, 2022",NOOO YUSENG!! it's so sad that they were forced to be the villain :(( fxxk you constellations and dokkabei. mostly the dokkabei bc they legit shaped the world in this TWSA world.
105,"Jun 23, 2022",Dokja scheming streak has ended. 😥 
105,"Jun 22, 2022",Beast King's Sensitivity is a much nicer name imo
105,"Jun 22, 2022",this is gold
105,"Jun 22, 2022",I sense that Dokja is about to make the most galaxy brain play in this series.
105,"Jun 22, 2022","future yuseung deserved better, but this was executed so well I can't "
105,"Jun 22, 2022","I get the feeling that those “Many” constellations laughing at Dokja’s decision are the Japanese ones he trolled — Also fvck that mid-grade Dokkaebi, I hope he gets his ass kicked (I get this vibe he will very soon)"
105,"Jun 22, 2022",i just hate the translation from disasters to catastrophe 
105,"Jun 22, 2022",this episode was EPIC!!!can't wait for the next one...
105,"Jun 22, 2022",that supporting actor pov panel after blocking her punch looked so damm amazing
105,"Jun 22, 2022","Everytime it seems that this story seems to fall in cliche or can lead to disappointing direction, something interesting occurs. And most of the time it seems to fit. I can't decide if this change fits for now, but this story was so far good and you guys had already shown that you know how to make good story and consistent worldbuilding, so let me say one thing.Good luck and thanks for finally exciting story."
105,"Jun 22, 2022",I patiently waited for a week to read this chapter 😭
105,"Jun 22, 2022",The constellation [The Death Monarch] demands  that the mid-level dokaibe who wears the suit be fired. The constellation [The Death Monarch] thinks that all the constellations hates that dokaibe by now.
105,"Jun 22, 2022",I should not have read this in the subway... how am I supposed to wipe my tears with the mask on!!!
105,"Jun 22, 2022",aaaaaaaaaaa this is so compelling 😭 huge thanks to the artists involved for making this story accessible to those of us who find books hard
105,"Jun 22, 2022",That dokkaebi is really pissing me off 
105,"Jun 22, 2022",This is...emotional
105,"Jun 15, 2022",i cried...😢😢
105,"May 18, 2022",It's wings. 😢
105,"Aug 3, 2022",THAT FCKING DOKKAEBI
105,"Jul 31, 2022","Go ahead and laugh, Constellations. Till the day Dokja pull you guys from up there down to nothing left of you even a single story."
105,"Jul 15, 2022","no, but who? WHO THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO DRAW DOJKA SO HANDSOME WHEN HE WAS LISTED AS ""AVERAGE-LOOKING PROTAGONIST"" WHO?? CUZ WHOEVER YOU ARE!! I LOVE YOU! THANK YOU! MY EYES ARE BLESSED!"
105,"Jul 4, 2022",why is Dokja so hot
105,"Jul 2, 2022",This is the best webtoon i've ever read hands down.
105,"Jun 29, 2022",dont mind me just crying in the corner..
105,"Jun 29, 2022",The constellation [Addictive Binger] grows tired of waiting for the next chapter. 
105,"Jun 28, 2022",literally started reading this like 3 days ago and now im fully caught up. this has been a really great series and I am excited for more!
105,"Jun 27, 2022",All my homies hate Paul 
105,"Jun 25, 2022","""It's okay. Go ahead and kill me."" :')"
105,"Jun 24, 2022",I DID NOT READ EVERY SINGLE EPISODE IN 3 DAYS 💀
105,"Jun 24, 2022","""Caution. This chapter is packed to the gills with EMOTIONAL DAMAGE."" Constellations be advised."
105,"Jun 23, 2022",can someone give me the head of that  dokkaebi🙂🔪
105,"Jun 23, 2022","Man, I really hope this gets turned into an Anime!"
105,"Jun 23, 2022",*crys*
105,"Jun 23, 2022",alright when is that goat gonna die am sick of him 
105,"Jun 23, 2022",When the GM railroads your railroading
105,"Jun 22, 2022",noooooo I got to the last chapter that was released I need to wait a week aaaaa The constellation Draganso as ben restrained by the divine chains 
105,"Jun 22, 2022",amazing
105,"Jun 22, 2022",why am I imagining DOOM music?
105,"Jun 22, 2022","I WILL BE BACK AFTRT AN HOUR, AND THEN WE SHALL DOMINATE"
105,"Jun 22, 2022",So this means Huiwon has become a character
105,"Jun 22, 2022","Told ya the goaties are evil mofos. I hope Dokja sweep them at the end, along the constellations. Bunch of powerful pricks."
105,"Jun 22, 2022",before this beautiful series ends someone oughta make sure that mid level dokebbai gets what he deserves
105,"Jun 22, 2022",I CAN'T EVEN RANT UNDER A COMMENT. WHERE ARE YOUR COMMENTS? DID YOU CHANGE YOUR NAME AGAIN?
105,"Jun 22, 2022","Yo, Dokja is gonna use the Judgement skill that Huiwon has. The one that only works against Evil targets, nice thinking Dokja."
105,"Jun 22, 2022","you know, what with kdj having everything go his way till now, i'm kinda glad to see him be humbled/make a mistake for once"
105,"Jun 22, 2022",Lee Jihye immediately picking up Lee Gilyoung and running 😭💜
105,"Jun 22, 2022",I have a sudden craving for lamb chops. Fresh lamb chops.
105,"Jun 22, 2022","The constellations seemed like they used to be pretty cool just watching, and I know they’d be mad with this guy manipulating them. But I lost a lot of respect for them letting the scenario change and agreeing that the plausibility could be changed because they’re being petty. Like it’s so freaking petty!!!! "
105,"Jun 22, 2022",I hate Paul the dokkaebi :'(
105,"Jun 22, 2022","the way Ji-hye grabbed Gil-Young and ran. she didn't think, just moved. "
105,"Jun 22, 2022",ooh Huiwon's skill is tailor made for this situation. The catastrophe will be determined as evil and the constellations of good alignment will kill her. It's unfortunate but I'm guessing that's what will happen.
105,"Jun 22, 2022",AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THE FUR
105,"Jun 13, 2022","It’s hurts to see him think In that moment before the slash, He’s showing us this is a price he has to pay whenever he fails to change a scene due to too many interventions."
105,"May 29, 2022",im not crying but i will say that my heart is literally gonna self-destruct in T-minus 5 seconds
105,"May 24, 2022",i hate that goat lookin mf with glasses i hope he gets what he deserves fr 🤚🏻
105,"May 20, 2022",this hurts my heart.
105,"May 19, 2022",dang the twist really hurts tbh
105,"May 19, 2022",Dokja my man I feel so bad for him
105,"May 19, 2022",This is not the scenario I wanted to see :(((( poor thing
105,"May 19, 2022",That one hurt a bit…
105,"May 19, 2022",I just love how fast Dokja just figures out everything. I mean if it was me I'll be so dense and dumb :')
105,"May 18, 2022",Never thought I’d hear namwoon’s name again. Rest In Peace.
105,"May 18, 2022",I can't see how to save both the younger and adult versions 😰
105,"May 18, 2022",SYS GOING AFTER JIHYE😭
105,"Aug 23, 2022","If you didn't notice, Eyes Waiting for Tuesday Night said:""I've ALWAYS found her story quite sad.""

HOW COULD ANYONE NOT NOTICE THIS
EITHER HE'S A READER OR HE'S LIKE SECRETIVE PLOTTER.
(i read the wn and I'm not telling you of secretive plotter's true identity. They wouldn't want you to know.)"
105,"Aug 20, 2022",[the scenario has been changed and set to angst]
105,"Aug 19, 2022",sobbing but also that panel of jihye picking up gilyoung😭
105,"Aug 12, 2022",I like how dokja started to use his reader skills more
105,"Aug 11, 2022",screw you dokkaebi with glasses
105,"Aug 5, 2022","LazyBrokeWeeb, where are you ;-;"
105,"Jul 30, 2022",Why isn't anyone talking about poor Jihye 😂 She's being chased by Future Yuseung without knowing why 😂

105,"Jul 5, 2022",I came back to this webtoon only to be met with depression and crying 🥲🥲
105,"Jun 29, 2022","that was sad 😭😭😭😭 Yuseong, you deserve better than this 😭"
105,"Jun 29, 2022",OH MY GOD. 1HR LEFT UNTIL THE WAR
105,"Jun 29, 2022",NOOOO PLEASE IM SO INVESTED
105,"Jun 29, 2022","That really. really sucks. Catastrophe Yuseung is aware the whole time yet can't control anything she's doing. Dokja genuinely wanted to save her. apart from gaming the constellation system, but now he's going to invoke Huiwon's ultimate skill and just destroy her because she was forced to become evil. I hope she can have closure in the end, at least."
105,"Jun 29, 2022",i've done it WHOOOOOOOO I READ ALL OF IT IN ONE DAY YAY!
105,"Jun 29, 2022",I only noticed now but if he defeats yuseung that dokkaebi has to give him the reward for the sub scenario
105,"Jun 29, 2022",no!!! 😭😭
105,"Jun 28, 2022",DOKJA PLEASE NO ITS 3AM AND IM CRYING- pleassseee

105,"Jun 25, 2022",I just realized how much Gilyeong and Yuseung look like offsprings of Dokja and Sangah
105,"Jun 25, 2022",cliffhanger should be illegal😭🔪
105,"Jun 25, 2022","Everything has been an uphill battle. I shouldn't be surprised now would be any different. however, Dokja always manages to find a way. He may come out on top like alwaus, but it's what he'll lose in the process that I'm worried about."

105,"Jun 24, 2022","man, this is really so sad :((( and the fact that the scam came back to bite him (well, I don't wanna say ""serves him right"" but uh -- well he did it to save bihyung's channel I guess but still) anyway, I still hope they could save future yuseung, but I feel like they won't be able to :(((((( at least they got through to her! I think she would have stayed if the dokkaebis let her"
105,"Jun 24, 2022",did huiwon just became a character !!
105,"Jun 24, 2022","Why do they have to kill her when the objective is to ""Defeat"" which includes immobilizing or her giving up the fight when she was on her knees -_- so much for a smart protagonist"
105,"Jun 24, 2022",that is trash! it would been been so cool having the catastrophe on their side and it's pretty heartbreaking to see her just wanting to die now 😢
105,"Jun 24, 2022",this is so sad. yuseung always one of my fav along with heewon n ofcoz biyoo too
105,"Jun 24, 2022","Oh wait! He’s using the alignment sword thing from Huiwon! Since her ability allows her to kill if they are evil but fail if they are good, if he uses it he will be able to kill the evil part of her… or maybe he won’t be able to hurt her because deep down she’s good. Or he’ll turn the sword on the mid-level dokkaebi enforcing the scenario. Ooh this is so interesting"
105,"Jun 23, 2022","both her and tiny yoosung told him ""it's okay kill me"" poor dokja can never catch a break with people he considers family 😢"
105,"Jun 23, 2022","her, ""it's ok, go ahead and kill me"" is as painful as Natasha's, ""it's ok, let me go""...I am not crying...YOU ARE..."

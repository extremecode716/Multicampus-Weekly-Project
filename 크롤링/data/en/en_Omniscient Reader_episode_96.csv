Episode,Date,Review
96,"Mar 16, 2022",Dokja the Adopted Dad 🥺 look at his whole family now
96,"Mar 16, 2022","I knew the kids would fight over him🤣But they both snuggled him and that's so cute because he's like a dad😭❤I'm shaking with excitement and anticipation to know what's going to happen next. They have yet to hit the 10,000 mark and Bihyeong (sorry if spelled wrong I'll check and correct if needed) is worried about it since Dokja getting a SC would violate their contract. Mans is counting down🤣"
96,"Mar 16, 2022","They cut it off just when Gilyoung was about to say: ""I think you are misinformed. Hyung likes a man."" 🤭"
96,"Mar 16, 2022","I’d like to add that the original scene of the kids arguing included this gem: 
“Don't talk to me, you worm bastard."" Lee Gilyoung was stunned. The cockroach and other bugs moved wildly on his head. Lee Gilyoung barely regained his composure. “Hyung hates kids like you."" ""I know who ahjussi likes."" ""…You know who hyung likes? Who?"" ""An unni."" Lee Gilyoung laughed. ""Unni? I think you are misinformed. Hyung likes a man."" ""How do you know?” ""I've been with hyung for a long time."""
96,"Mar 16, 2022","Lol! The way both Gil and Yuseung are already shooting daggers at each other. Dokja is definitely going to face his most difficult challenge yet, the subtle yet extreme art of parenting two kids without showing favouritism. 😂"
96,"Mar 16, 2022",Dokja has achieved Exhausted Single Dad status. Chesh offers 5 coins of sympathy. 
96,"Mar 16, 2022","Lee Gilyoung when he meets Shin Yuseung: Finally a worthy opponent, our bickering will be legendary!!.  "
96,"Mar 16, 2022","Dokja checking in on Huiwon was really wholesome. I think the fact that Dokja has succeeded so much in this harsh and brutal world by not losing his humanity and also looking out for his loyal friends who maybe powerful now but when they started off were just normal people, shows how true friendship and affection can make even the worst of horrors, survivable."
96,"Mar 16, 2022",I. Love. This. Damn. Story.
96,"Mar 16, 2022",Huiwon is getting super strong and she looks so handsome in that suit 😍
96,"Mar 16, 2022",Dokja has 2 Pokémon trainers under his wing 😂
96,"Mar 16, 2022","Ah yes, the sibling rivalry for Dokja's attention "
96,"Mar 16, 2022",Lmaooooo…It’s almost as if she’s the omniscient reader between the two of us 🤣🤣
96,"Mar 16, 2022","It's still so weird to see Dokja being addressed as just ""Dokja"" by the boys instead of ""hyung""... at least ""Mister"" is still in 😅"

96,"Mar 16, 2022","YES Huiwon appears again, I missed her "
96,"Mar 16, 2022",Where’s the bug boy’s hammer of thor? 😂
96,"Apr 15, 2022",Time to see how the Omniscient Scammer gets his way out of his promise to the constellations 
96,"Mar 16, 2022","are the translators sure that ""Dokja"" doesnt mean ""Dad""?"
96,"Mar 18, 2022","I remember Dokja ""befriended"" all these people at first because he thought they would be useful and he was gonna use them now look at them being friends<3"
96,"Mar 19, 2022",Huiwon in a suit. 😳😳😳
96,"Mar 16, 2022","No, babies! Don't fight! You can share your dad!"
96,"Mar 16, 2022",So glad to be back with you guys had to take my medical boards so I missed a week…. It wasn’t worth missing but I did pass 🤩
96,"Mar 16, 2022",Oooo the Monster & insect tamers death stare👀🤣 
96,"Mar 16, 2022",dokja with the kiddos is so cute ☺️ 
96,"Mar 16, 2022","Uh oh, I hope he has a good plan because it seems like he might be forced to choose a constellation "
96,"Mar 16, 2022",DOKJA IS LIKE A DAD🤗🥰🥰....I CAN'T 
96,"Apr 20, 2022","Everyone is talking about the kids, but what about Donghoon, the angsty gamer teen son?"
96,"Apr 9, 2022",I love how Dokja's not even dating but he's already raising 2 pre teens 😭🤣
96,"Apr 20, 2022","Aww i wanted the ""Hyung likes a man"" to be included, but then again, beggars can't be pickers"
96,"Apr 20, 2022",that panel of Dokja waking up with the kids lying beside him was so domestic and wholesome
96,"Apr 20, 2022",i am so proud of this single dad raising two kids in his own
96,"Apr 20, 2022",okey but Huiwon outfit
96,"Apr 20, 2022",dokja low-key turning into Batman with all these kids he's adopting 
96,"Apr 21, 2022",His name might mean only child but he is a proud father of 3 😌
96,"Apr 9, 2022",Huiwon in a suit! i repeat. HUIWON IN A SUIT!!!
96,"Apr 20, 2022",still upset and sad they cutted Gilyoung and Yoosoung's hilarious conversation 💀
96,"Apr 20, 2022",seeing Jung Huiwon makes me smile
96,"Mar 20, 2022","Even if only for a small moment, I'm so happy to see Huiwon again!! And those clothes really suit her (I really like finger-less gloves ngl) "
96,"Apr 20, 2022",in a blink of an eye Dokja became a dad of two😆
96,"Apr 20, 2022","Those two are really fighting over Dokja, huh?"
96,"Mar 17, 2022","this story is good. I've read the novel but to see my beloved characters come to life, qnd have the antics I enjoyed brought forth, is so wonderful. Ot makes me cackle to see the young ones fight, to see the little doekabii in all thier fluff. to thise who made it this far,this journey is one you won't forget I can promise you"
96,"Apr 20, 2022",NOOOOO THE HYUNG LIKES A MAN LINE😭
96,"Apr 20, 2022","I'm the second here as a non-fast-passer! I would like to thank my family, my dog and my friends for this opportunity. Gilyoung and Yoosung were adorable this chapter. I'm excited for what's to come!"
96,"Mar 16, 2022","The kids are the cutest, can't wait to see more of their interactions 😅  Gil's face in the thumbnail is so happy! "
96,"Apr 20, 2022",They cutted 'THE' part 😭
96,"Apr 20, 2022","Why does this man smile when others suffer? Makes me feel bad for the dokkaebi heheh. And I think he's beginning to understand how difficult raising children is. Huiwon and Dokja give off sibling vibes though. The way she was able to tell she was there- WHOA. Also, I think a lot of us have forgotten that this is an apocalypse for everyone, including our main cast's families. I wonder if we'll ever get to meet Sangah's family. And Dokja's I know because wiki spoilers heheh."
96,"Apr 20, 2022",nooo they cut off the part where Gilyoung says dokja likes a man 😭😭😭
96,"Mar 16, 2022",Okay I wanted that to be Gilyoung’s gf but the fact that they’re fighting for favorite child is way better 🥺😂
96,"Mar 16, 2022",The kids are just so precious 😂
96,"Apr 21, 2022",Dokja literally saved both these kids from having to turn down terrible paths it’s so cute to have them look to him as a parental figure. I just hope they eventually get along because together they have domain over basically all of the animal kingdom. Which dokja’s “intuition” watching their backs then they’d be an unstoppable team. 
96,"Apr 21, 2022",Dokja and the kids are so adorable 🥰  also they have only been separated for a week?!? It feels like months to me but that’s because I only read this once a week 😂 😭
96,"Apr 20, 2022",Dokja is a now a non-proud father of two😂🤣🤣
96,"Apr 2, 2022",Man they argue like REAL siblings LMAO 😂
96,"Apr 21, 2022",hyung likes a man

96,"Apr 27, 2022","THE NOVEL IS DIFFERENT! WHEN YOOSEUNG SAID THAT DOKJA LIKES GIRLS OR SANGAH, GILYEONG ACTUALLY SAID ""HYUNG LIKES GUYS/MAN"" 🥴"
96,"Apr 25, 2022",Seeing everyone at that comment's replies saying they'll read the novel is giving me life~
96,"Apr 21, 2022",I can't get over what a great dad Dokja is.
96,"Apr 21, 2022","the way they cut it right before gilyoung says “hyung likes a man” and then cut to dokja waking up like 👁👄👁 almost feels like a nod to the novel readers, like “you know what happened lol”"
96,"Apr 20, 2022",Dokja the omniscient reader? Nah. Dokja the tired dad.
96,"Apr 20, 2022","The Constellation [The Sadistic Chicken Lord] is gleeful at the drama that is happening between the two kids and the entertainment they will bring with their rivalry, 500 Coins each have been gifted to the Incarnation Gilyeong and the Catastrophe Yuseung Shin"

96,"Apr 6, 2022",that icy catastrophe suits Junghyeok lol❄️
96,"Mar 16, 2022",Dokja is the Omniscient Reader and yet he needs those 2 kids to tell him who he likes. Typical protagonist behaviour
96,"Mar 16, 2022",Dokja is gonna get the secretive ploter I'm sure
96,"Apr 20, 2022","HUIWON IN A SUIT, I REPEAT HUIWON IN A SUIT "

And the family that he has found & chosen along the way has been super awesome.

96,"Jul 21, 2022","NGL, I wish my kids wanted to snuggle with me like that from time to time. Whereas my spouse probably wishes they snuggled with them less. Also thanks to top comment about the missing line pointing out the differences between original novel and comic version. Definitely checking out the original novel to find out more of the lore and do a comparison."

96,"Jul 13, 2022",sibling rivalry lmaoo
96,"Jul 9, 2022","*possible spoiler just a theory*


what if Dokja is the constellation The Secretive Plotter? The name fits, and he is just there, not much is known about them, and they are becoming slowly more predominant in Dokjas life."
96,"Jul 8, 2022","Now I'm for sure certain, he's raising pokemon trainers"
96,"Jul 7, 2022",Ohh how I miss seeing Huiwon 🥺

96,"May 5, 2022","NOOOOOOO they cut out my fave Gilyoung scene!!😭😭 It's HILARIOUS when Yusueng starts to talk about a girl (that's probably implied to be Yu Sangah) that Dokja likes and then he confidently goes, "" I think you're misinformed, Dokja likes a man!"" 😂😂🤣"

96,"Apr 21, 2022",LMAO I wasn't expecting Gilyeong and Yuseung to fight over Dokja like that 🤣🤣 I think it's even funnier considering that Dokja is afraid Yuseung will leave him for Junghyeok if they ever meet. But looks like she really admires Dokja's. That's good..
96,"Apr 21, 2022",Yuseung already looks like she's out to get Gilyeong in the first panel 😂

96,"Apr 20, 2022","Dokja: ""Whats it been a week?""  Me: Its been 84 years....... Granted, that is a long week for Gilyoung to be away from his dad. So happy to see Huiwon again tho, I can't wait to see her supporting constellation."

96,"Apr 20, 2022",I'M ALSO HERE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE TWO COMMENTERS WHO HATE ON YOOSUNG 'BECAUSE SHE'S A LITTLE GIRL' WHY O WHY? YOU LOOK AT THAT CUTE FACE AND WHAT????
96,"Apr 20, 2022",The authors of this series apparently have another series called 'The World after the Fall' which has recently come to Webtoon! I think it's pretty interesting as well.
96,"Apr 20, 2022","LMAO. They're like two kindergarten children latching onto their parent. It's really cute lol. Dokja is a single dad after the apocalypse! I do sympathize with the kids. They're not kindergartners, but they're still young kids and their society was destroyed. They're not safe now either. Even strong adults could easily die at any moment. This is a legitimately scary world to live and grow up as a kid. "
96,"Apr 20, 2022","THEY CUT OUT THE ""You're wrong. Hyung likes a man."" SJBDJWJSNSBS"
96,"Apr 20, 2022","Its good to know that Dokja didnt exactly ditched or ignored his friends, he was actually watching them through his skill"
96,"Apr 20, 2022",dokja ultimate dad
96,"Apr 20, 2022",this is too cute fksjgnmsnd
96,"Apr 20, 2022","Dokja, dad of two jealous kids. 🤣"
96,"Apr 20, 2022",How many scenarios are there. All I know is the jeongyuk yu is a regressor and got to this scenario many times. But how many till they win? Also - Dokja is going to be a daddy when all this is over. He’s already a daddy. 
96,"Apr 20, 2022",it feels wired that the episode didn't end with the window that tells the scenario going on
96,"Apr 20, 2022","WAS IT JUST ME OR DID THEY CUT OFF THE PART WHERE GILYOUNG SAID SOMETHING LIEK ""i think you are misinformed, Hyung likes a man"" ????"
96,"Apr 20, 2022",It makes my heart so warm to see them bicker over Dokya so jealously 😭😭💖💖💖💖 so cute 
96,"Apr 20, 2022",I'm truly sorry but I don't really like that little animal girl (I'm sorry I can't remember her name)
96,"Apr 20, 2022",Anyone else think the dokkafebi with glasses has a super nasal voice?
96,"Apr 20, 2022",Bro lmao! Dokja looked so much like a dad it was so cute! Two of his kids fighting over who gets to hang out with dad the longest 😂 It’s such a cute image! He didn’t try to be an adoptive father but ended up as one 😆
96,"Apr 20, 2022",Dokja became a Father of 2-- I mean 3 LOL 
96,"Apr 20, 2022","when the two kids fighting for their dad, now I want to see the reaction of the father(junghyeok) to their new child"
96,"Apr 20, 2022",I ship the tiny children.
96,"Apr 20, 2022",I got too impatient & read ahead in the web novel. this is so worth keeping up with 
96,"Apr 20, 2022","she knows dokja for a week who does she think she is? besides it’s not a girl, it’s a MAN😤"
96,"Apr 20, 2022","Here it is. The greatest rivalry we've all been waiting for. Two dangerously overpowered kids fighting over the love of their adoptive, suicidal father. It's like two wild animals fighting over territory, which is fitting considering they're both tamers. Funny how Shin Yoosung immediately switches to hostile-competitive mode once the threat of another child taking her ahjussi's attention came into the picture."
96,"Apr 20, 2022","Gee, I’ve never had top comment!"
96,"Apr 20, 2022","This is probably the  only webtoon that I can say doesn’t decrease in quality by the episode. I don’t think I’ve been bored once with this comic. My only hope is that the comic doesn’t, for lack of better words, “overstay its welcome.” In other words, i hope the writer doesn’t extend the story to the point where it becomes stale. Sometimes its better for things to end than it is for them to wear and tear. But since this based on a book, I think it’ll turn out fine, length wise."
96,"Apr 20, 2022",Okay now how is he gonna get out of his promise to choose a constellation? That's gonna be interesting to see. Is the new kid gonna play a role in that? 
96,"Apr 20, 2022",I guess the catastrophe of flood's emergence was due a child's jealousy now
96,"Apr 20, 2022",Man the constellation are gonna be livid when they realise Dokja F them and is proposing something like caloberation. Plus the kids are funny
96,"Apr 20, 2022",So Dokja's now the Tired Dad™ lol ... and I'm guessing Bihyeong was counting the number of constellations so idk how Dokja won't get one at this rate. And Yuseung the Catastrophe looks cool already can't wait !!
96,"Apr 20, 2022",Dokja and Jonghyuk now have two kids🥺
96,"Apr 20, 2022",(NEWS! Child prodigies fighting over who gets to be the favorite child of a single father.)

96,"Mar 17, 2022",Uh-oh.. 
96,"Mar 17, 2022",I just hope that his choices don’t backfire and he loses a great companion! Especially the children!
96,"Mar 16, 2022",Ooo Dokja made a deal!! He has to pick his constellation next episode!!! 
96,"Mar 16, 2022",I’m excited to see all the characters finally coming together 
96,"Mar 16, 2022",Oh no. He has to pick a supporting constellation now.
96,"Mar 16, 2022","I think there might have been a translation error. When the two kids are together the Dokja he thinks ""Like recognises like"" but I think the actual saying is ""Game recognises game"". Just a small nickpick but an amazing episode"
96,"Mar 16, 2022",the moment we've all been waiting for
96,"Mar 16, 2022","Daddy Dokja learns about parenting, so cute."

96,"Mar 16, 2022",It's cute how they fight over him lmao
96,"Mar 16, 2022",It’s nice to finally see the kids meeting. (°▽°)
96,"Mar 16, 2022",Best Girl Huiwon returns! Dokja's right hand woman!
96,"Mar 16, 2022",things are finally getting interesting.🤔
96,"Mar 16, 2022",I’ve heard of cats and dogs but beasts and insects?! Sheesh
96,"Apr 20, 2022","He's adopting lot's of kids, hope he finds a mom for them."
96,"Apr 20, 2022",nooo they cut it at the part when gilyoung says that dokja likes a man 😭😭 
96,"Apr 20, 2022",Am I the only one that thinks when they grow up they would be a good ship?
96,"Jun 8, 2022",I ship the two kids
96,"May 26, 2022",They be hetwashing (straightwashing) Dokja T-T wish they would keep more dialogue from the original novel...tbh I have yet to complete the novel its really long and it takes forever to get free coins but it has imo a Yaoi undertone...
96,"May 10, 2022",I ship Gilyoung and Yuseung
96,"Apr 21, 2022",AHAHAHA THE KIDS ALREADY FIGHTING OVER ADOPTIVE DAD 😂😂🤣🤣🤣
96,"Apr 21, 2022",100 chapters and at like 20% of the novel LOL this is why it is never a good idea to make a manwha on a webnovel
96,"Apr 20, 2022",woah a hot dokkeibi? dokei? what
96,"Apr 20, 2022",Can't wait for the next episode.
96,"Apr 20, 2022",NO NOT MY EMOTIONAL SUPPORT QUEERBAIT 😭😭😭😭😭
96,"May 8, 2022",Help- did i just ship Gilyeong and The little girlie?? they hate each other but😋😩 lollll so cuteeee
96,"Apr 20, 2022",We need R Rating for the first image.
96,"Apr 22, 2022",I think it’s about time dokja gets some pussy
96,"Mar 16, 2022","Dokja is the father then would some of you agree Sangah would be the mother figure for the children not only that Sangah throughout the series she acts like a mother figure 
Dokja + Sangah + Gilyeong + Yoosung = Family "
96,"Apr 20, 2022","a little weird that the kids have big crushes on dokja, but its pretty hilarious. despite the two super underage having crushes on an adult, it doesnt feel as gross as other asian novels/comics because they portray Dokja as the unwilling recipient to their affections rather than those squeamish long gazes and sensual undertones others have.

77,"Nov 3, 2021",Confirmed that the Demonic Judge of Fire ships Dokja and Junghyeok.
77,"Nov 3, 2021",‚ÄúYou are acting like a wife.‚Äù~ Han Su-Yeong 
77,"Nov 3, 2021",they changed it... they changed the wife quote.... gonna cry
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Dokja unlocked a new skill! Malewife 
77,"Nov 3, 2021",demonic judge is hard shipping here and rich enough to fund the ship
77,"Nov 3, 2021",THE WAY BOTH OF THEM JERKED BACKWARDS WHEN YJH OPENED HIS EYES PLS SNHDHDHDHDHD
77,"Nov 3, 2021","oh right in the soup panel with demonic judge of fire‚Äôs indirect message spam, the small text next to dokja‚Äôs speech bubble should say ‚Äúshe‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhe‚Äù"
77,"Nov 3, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" was deeply moved that it spits its drink on the monitor.] [The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" wanted to sponsor more but cant.] [5 coins have been sponsored. ]"
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Demonic Judge of Fire: now kissss!
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Uriel being the best fan girl in all our hearts.
77,"Nov 3, 2021","in all seriousness, I too wish to be fed by Dokja "
77,"Nov 3, 2021","‚ÄúI‚Äôll seduce him‚Äù Suyeong says, little does she know that Junghyeouk is the gigachad [+5 coins]"
77,"Nov 3, 2021",""" This looks like it will end up killing him """" Well I guess he have to die then.""
Why do I find it so hilarious üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
77,"Nov 3, 2021",I mean..they would make a cute couple. Also wooowww he seriously caught onto him and had them take him to Dokja specifically. They're gonna make great friends
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Kim Dokja is everything - Manipulate Mansplain Malewife
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Something tells me those coins for feeding him was of a different nature than just kindness
77,"Nov 3, 2021","I find it hilarious that the ""main character"" seems to always be passed out somewhere "
77,"Nov 3, 2021",canonically assigned malewife by han suyeong........
77,"Nov 3, 2021",dokja saying he wont let Suyeong feed Junghyeok even if she wants too LMAO alright someone is possessive
77,"Nov 3, 2021",The fact that Suyeong would willingly try to seduce Junhyeok is the strawberry ontop of the cake for me
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Am I the only one to find Bihyeong cute??
77,"Nov 3, 2021",‚ÄúYou two would make a great couple.‚Äù Yes. Yes they would. 
77,"Nov 3, 2021",not Dokja and Junghyeok getting shipped by the Demonic Judge of Fire üò≠
77,"Nov 3, 2021","Hmm I‚Äôd miss it being called [Midday Tryst] but, [Midday Rendezvous] is kinda cool, right?"
77,"Nov 3, 2021","I don't think Dokja could ever decide to kill or let protagonist boy die. He spent so much time wishing he was like him in the past that he's still not fully aware that he's grown a ton as a person caught up in this crazy world. As for Yu, I'm very interested to know how he knows as much as he does about Dokja all of a sudden. I have a feeling that things are going to get even more interesting in the next few chapters. "
77,"Nov 3, 2021",I can sense a bromance forming
77,"Nov 3, 2021",when you try and do all the side quest's to get stronger BUT THAT 1 A-HOLE is speed running the main campaign!!!

77,"Nov 3, 2021",ALSO AT THE END.... IT IS HER!!! OMG!! IM SO EXCITED!!! 
77,"Nov 17, 2021","I just realize but Webtoon did A BIG miss translations yet again! In Jonghyuk character profile, his second stigma is reincarnation when he already had regression. This two was almost the same yet different that why you can't both skill in one person. Regression is for regressor like Jonghyuk and reincarnation for reincarnator. PLS fix this webtoon! It is supposed to be ""Transmission"" a skill that let a regressor get his previous skill. Webtoon keep making mistake here and there üò≠"
77,"Nov 8, 2021",god i love hsy and kdj. ultimate asshole friendship. wlw mlm solidarity (hostility). aroallo aroace hostility (solidarity). both tsunderes but different in the most frustrating way possible (kdj: [antagonizes someone nonstop then dies for them with zero hesitation] no one could ever love me // hsy: [absolutely horrible unhinged with one (1) gram of Cares About People] i don‚Äôt care about you). add yjh and it‚Äôs THREE terrible assholes who never say what they mean. ultimate main character trio tbh

77,"Nov 3, 2021","and why are they referring to Uriel as ""he""? "
77,"Dec 2, 2021","Ok but like isn‚Äôt it cool that the Writer/Plagiarist, The Reader, and the Protagonist are all here together now. I heard they‚Äôre one of the best trio‚ú®"
77,"Nov 3, 2021",‚ÄúYou two would make a great couple.‚Äù YOU ARE SO RIGHT
77,"Nov 3, 2021",Dokja did you really expect a thanks?

77,"Nov 14, 2021","I truly hope I can complain to webtoon to change the translator, even illegal scanlation have better translation than webtoon. I think those scanlation translator should hired by webtoon. I am sorry since this is kinda rude, I am just tired since Omniscient Reader is top series in the webtoon, but the translation can't give it justice"

77,"Dec 8, 2021",My new favourite power duo with a ‚Äúwe only tolerate eachother‚Äù relationships - Han Su-Yeong and Dokja. Their dynamic and the way they bounce off eachother is so funny to me

77,"Dec 9, 2021","I honestly have never shipped two men so hard together even when reading the best of the BL masterpieces out there, which I do quite often. I think I'm going to be a KDJ√óYJH fanfic addict soon enough, too."

77,"Dec 8, 2021","i just can't have enough of junghyeok. Everytime i see him, i fall for him. I know Dokja is the MC but sometimes someone outshines him. As someone who finished the novel already, I know how great of a character he is. i just cant help falling for him. That sunfish basta*d is pure love ‚ù§"
77,"Dec 8, 2021",Am I the only one who thinks Dokja is getting cuter day by day gradually? 
77,"Dec 8, 2021",the demonic judge of fire is supportive of you lmfao
77,"Dec 8, 2021",Yeah I really wanna know what would happen to them if he regressed. Do those versions of the people we know disappear? Is Dokja the same in each regression? Has he failed to stop junhyeok from killing himself in previous regressions? I have too many questions now and no coins to help answer them
77,"Dec 8, 2021","Yo webtoon, The Demonic Judge of Fire is a 'she', not a 'he'. (This isn't a spoiler, it was revealed somewhere in the first 10 chapters...)"

77,"Nov 3, 2021","huh. ‚Äúmidday rendezvous‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmidday tryst‚Äù. is that just a webtoon translators thing, or did they change the actual korean term between the webnovel and the ebook? because that seems like the kind of change singnsong would have made for the ebook version, but webtoon‚Äôs translators have updated terms before"
77,"Jan 14, 2022",nah istg dokja keeps flirting with the guy who's supposed to kill him

77,"Dec 8, 2021","Also, thanks Dokja for making me remember how much I miss Huiwon and the gang"
77,"Dec 8, 2021",Guess she was right. He is capable of asking for help. This story is so full of surprises‚Ä¶
77,"Dec 8, 2021","Ugh what is up with Webtoons translators lately?!?!?!?!?!  They can't even stay consistent. In ch 42/43 Junghyeok's 2nd stigma is TRANSMISSION not Reincarnation (which is not an appropriate term for the ability).  It's really sad to see the ""official"" translation become pure & utter trash."
77,"Dec 8, 2021","Ok, spoiler questions time, be warned. 1) Why Dokja is calling Uriel He, when he knows it's a she? 2) Why Jonghuyk has a Reincarnation stigma? He's a Regressor, not a Reincarnator, that's entirely different stigma and sponsor behind it."
77,"Nov 5, 2021",I was really hoping to see more of the love///hate///troll relationship lol. it's the best thing in this webtoon.
77,"Jan 9, 2022",I am so glad me and the constellations are on the same ship üö¢ it's like a cruise line

77,"Dec 31, 2021",SOMEBODY FINALLY SAID IT!!!! THEY ARE PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER 
77,"Dec 17, 2021",Ok but. Blowing on tea before giving it to your loved one is extremely my shit. Even if it‚Äôs weird gross antidote potion. I also would have gifted coins for this scene
77,"Dec 16, 2021","The soup: ‚ÄúThis looks like it‚Äôll end up killing him‚Äù 
‚ÄúThen I guess he‚Äôll have to die‚Äù 

I LOVE THEM"
77,"Dec 15, 2021",bruh the first time Junghyoek woke up was a literal jumpscare 
77,"Dec 13, 2021","Lol Han Sooyoung is always arrogant, but I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs only one person who could seduce Junghyuk üòÇ. Lol this was one of the funniest scenes. And‚Ä¶ prolly the scene where Uriel began to do that üòÖ. Oh, but Midday Rendezvous is highly useful in ways Telepathy isn‚Äôt! Ah‚Ä¶ her."
77,"Dec 11, 2021",Uriel is literally paying for Dokja and Joonghyuk to interact. She's the perfect definition of a simp.

77,"Dec 8, 2021","""Here, I found a spoon"" where? How? Why? Things you never think of in the apocalypse"
77,"Dec 8, 2021",wouldn't be surprised if the Demonic Judge of Fire gives a Million coins to Dokja if he married Junghyeok 
77,"Dec 8, 2021",üòÜ lmaooo these tsundere's
77,"Dec 8, 2021","""You two would make a great couple""Me:Stop, if you say that the fujoshi community reading this will... *Looks at the comment section*, never mind it's too late."
77,"Dec 8, 2021",...why would you change the lines from the novel into something thats worse than the original? like its not so hard to keep the original meaning of the lines but u just had to change it? there has been many mistranslations / not as good tl in this manhwa but this chapter's ones was one of the worst imo LIKE THE WIFE LINE...

Episode,Date,Review
66,"Aug 18, 2021",my favorite part of this comic is watching dokja piss off the dokkebi and especially Jungyeok
66,"Aug 18, 2021","Feels like a prologue ending. We're in the big leagues now, folks."
66,"Aug 18, 2021","(Please read my replies too) Here, the Big Dipper made an appearance. But actually, it already had in ch61 and 62. In ch61, ""Room of the North Star"" was actually ""Room of the Big Dipper"". Big Dipper is 북두칠성, but the reason for the mistranslation to ""North Star"" was because 북 means ""North"". However, these two are completely different. North Star (북쪽 별) is another name for Polaris (폴라리스) belonging to Ursa Minor, stemming from its position being the closest to the northen celestial pole, while..."
66,"Aug 18, 2021",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' have mixed feelings about the throne and will wait for the outcome of this scenario.][5 coins have been sponsored.]
66,"Aug 18, 2021",It seems like a few constellations are about to have an existential crisis. 
66,"Aug 18, 2021",NO BUT DOKJA TURNED JUNGHYEOK FROM LAYING FACE DOWN AND POSITIONED HIS HAND OVER HIS STOMACH LIKE A SLEEPING PRINCE I CAN'T
66,"Aug 18, 2021","Imagine meeting your favorite protagonist, knocking him out, and slapping him silly. That’s djk for ya"
66,"Aug 18, 2021","I know this scene is really tense, but watching Dokja walk around in a dusty robe with a sword and a giant vase is really funny. He looks like a beginner in an rpg where you pick up and wear whatever you can find 😂"
66,"Aug 18, 2021",dokja be like: 👏 why 👏 you 👏 always 👏 gotta 👏 try to 👏 kill me 👏 junghyeok *slaps more*
66,"Aug 18, 2021",You know sh*t’s about to go down when the rain freezes in time.
66,"Aug 18, 2021","""I guess this is my only chance to ever slap you"" and you don't plan on wasting it lmao "
66,"Aug 18, 2021",Man dokja out here trying to troll the gods. Half expecting him to turn to the constellations and say “is this deez?”
66,"Aug 18, 2021",Damn Junghyeok realized this on his 41st recession?  Dokja is speedrunning this.
66,"Aug 26, 2021","Yo Huiwon is the best character in this comic, god she is so badass. She's always ready to throw hands for Dokja."
66,"Aug 18, 2021",I think Mr.Dokaebbi is mad
66,"Aug 18, 2021",i am not like the others. your tricks wont work on me. Dokja: hmm is that right? ( proceeds to do the impossible and tricks him anyways.) you were saying?
66,"Aug 18, 2021","YOOOO THIS HAS BEEN BANGER AFTER BANGER FOR A DAMN WHILE NOW, I am loving this plz take all my money and keep releasing, don't drag it out longer then necessary but until your vision is complete I'm strapped in for the ride :)"
66,"Aug 18, 2021","The constellation [Lord of the Bleeding Wallet] gazes around in confusion at the absence of [Lazy Broke Weeb]. He hesitates to continue, but gives his offering. [5 coins have been sponsored.]"
66,"Aug 18, 2021","Can I just say I love the causal passing of the jar (sorry, forgot what it's called, if you know please tell me). The focus should be on the whole ""you're acting like the main character"" bit and everyone rallying to defend Dokja but in my head, it's just two panels of ""here, a jar"" ""Inventory update: one jar. Equip jar?"" and it's cracking me up"
66,"Aug 18, 2021","I’m really loving this WEBTOON. Probably one of my favourites out of them all. I love the story, the characters, and the art. everything about it gets me excited for the next episode"
66,"Aug 18, 2021",Sigh…the translations are so bad like they’re made to intentionally confuse. Just to be clear sitting on the throne does NOT make you a constellation. It raises the status of your sponsor so they have an opportunity to go from historical grade to narrative grade. That’s why they’re all salivating over it. Also what dokja meant was that sitting on it would make it impossible for him to reach the end of all scenarios. This scenario itself will end with someone sitting on the throne.
66,"Aug 18, 2021",Imagine passing out with a glare on your face 😂😂 Wow Dokja you've gotten on Junghyuk's bad side so much that even if he's passed out he's still gotta let you know that he's pissed off😂
66,"Aug 18, 2021",Dokja: Strength Lv. 100 *smirks and proceed to punch YJH* Also Dokja: Oh sh*t! I hope that he isn't dead *worried face*
66,"Aug 19, 2021",That is the face of Dokkebi that's about to turn on all his Minecraft Hacks and is about to get banned from the server for admin abuse.
66,"Aug 18, 2021",HDKDVFKDBKD DOKJA REALLY JUST PICKED HIM UP LIKE A CAT
66,"Aug 18, 2021","[The Constellation, LADY OF THE SINGULAR FOOTWEAR, is increasingly bemused by Dokja's apparent death wish. 5 coins have been sponsored.] "
66,"Aug 18, 2021",This just keeps getting better and better 
66,"Aug 18, 2021",Someone call a burn unit cause Dokja is spitting hot fire and these constellations are getting ROASTED!
66,"Aug 18, 2021",65 chapters in and each chapter is still as good as the last!
66,"Aug 18, 2021","""fair fight"" he said"
66,"Sep 22, 2021","I keep forgetting they're in the middle of an apocalypse and only Joonghyuk is the most prepared one when it comes to attire. So when it showed Dokja wearing third rate converse rip-offs, I lost it."
66,"Aug 18, 2021","in the novel he said ""i don't want to be king of ugly humans like you"" and ""i don't want you ugly constellations to be my sponsor"" 😂 on another note...i like that scene where the rain stops."
66,"Aug 18, 2021",This is jungyeoks third failed attempt at killing Dokja I’d assume he’s tired of getting outplayed 
66,"Sep 22, 2021","i usually dislike these video game-esque webtoons where the mc is super unique and op but goddamn this one does it different so that im always entertained. its rarely dokja flat out having op abilities that can annihilate characters or just somehow being super strong or whatever, but the times when it is it feels so earned that its hype as hell. seeing him punch the hell out of jungyeok was so satisfying. so many chapters worth of planning to all pay off here and it was so worth it. 10/10"
66,"Sep 22, 2021",Okay but huiwon running up there like that really got me excited I love her 
66,"Sep 22, 2021",Jungyeok sleeps through all the important stuff. At least his sister is seeing it this time and can tell him about it. 
66,"Aug 20, 2021","Guys, it been a whole year since this series launched! 🎉"
66,"Aug 19, 2021","""one eyed Maitreya throws his eyepatch to the ground"" 😂😂😂"
66,"Aug 21, 2021","My favourite part was definitely when Heewon saw the Maitreya ruler and was like, ""Gungye?"" I bursted out laughing XD"
66,"Aug 18, 2021","Loved pingpong Joonghyuk 🏓 I didn't realize the ""ROAR"" was because of the thunder so it seemed like Joonghyuk was the one who did it lol he was picked up like a big cat. The way they showcased time stopping with the rain was *chef's kiss*"
66,"Aug 18, 2021","Ah yes, our favorite protagonist, Junghyeok the pinball 😂"
66,"Sep 13, 2021","I find it endearing when Kim Dokja slaps Yoo Jonghyuk, whether it be his face or the unforgettable back-of-the-head slap"
66,"Aug 24, 2021",Lazy Broke Weeb certainly isn’t broke if they’re able to fast pass every week😏
66,"Aug 28, 2021",I tell you what I'm enjoying Dokja more and more as a character
66,"Aug 18, 2021","reaching lv.100: 72,000 coins.                               the look on Junghyeok's face: priceless"
66,"Aug 18, 2021",The fact that YJH’s body ricochets onto the barrier is giving me life 
66,"Aug 18, 2021","Another good week of Dokja making almost everyone mad, beautiful "
66,"Sep 22, 2021",Seeing  Dokja piss off the dokkebi is just pure entertainment 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
66,"Aug 18, 2021","damn bro, imagine being the MAIN CHARACTER and OP God amongst men, and getting 1-shot by some random who showed up out of nowhere. 
COULDN'T BE ME 😂😂"
66,"Sep 22, 2021",dokja really said 'oh junghyeok's out? best time to slap him i guess'
66,"Sep 22, 2021",Has anyone else noticed that the squares around the Omniscient reader letters have started... Fading? Like the future of the novel is being changed? Weird. 
66,"Sep 23, 2021","No One:Absolutely No One:
Kim Dojka: I’m gonna piss off every powerful being in this world that has the ability to kill me"
66,"Sep 23, 2021","has it already been noted that dokja read twsa and they just mentioned how he's more like maim character and...here we are reading it and he is the main character...so...if this series end and we read till the end...will we have all knowledge of next scenario 😶 will we become the ""prophets"""
66,"Sep 22, 2021","I love how this makes TWO major arcs having ended with dokja beating up junghyeok, junghyeok passing out, and dokja slapping and lecturing him"
66,"Aug 19, 2021","And so it finally begins!! To think, everything until now has been basically the prologue!! XD"
66,"Aug 18, 2021","There goes Huiwon being best girl again, bringing that ""hell hath no fury"" fire"
66,"Aug 18, 2021",yoooo they really be having a fight over junghyeok's body 😭😭😭
66,"Sep 22, 2021",im in love with the constant teasing dokja does to junghyuk its like a brotherly love 
66,"Sep 22, 2021","Junghyeok:  *On his 3rd Regression* | Dokja: ""He would only realize this in his 41st Regression."" | Me: ""PAIN! Immediate pain!"""
66,"Aug 24, 2021",Meanwhile Jungheok just lying there on the ground…
66,"Aug 18, 2021",I swear to God you could make a spin off of him finding new and creative ways to piss off Jeongyku and it will never get old.
66,"Sep 23, 2021",wow Huiwon showed up ready to THROW DOWN. I love that Dokja has this whole squad of people willing to risk it all for him.
66,"Sep 22, 2021",Imagine entering your favorite book/show and beating the main character...
66,"Aug 18, 2021","""But aren't you going to anyway?"" honestly with Dokja I never know anymore"
66,"Oct 21, 2021","""the perfect uppercut doesn't exi-"" never mind. "
66,"Sep 23, 2021","""Money can get you anywhere""- Dokja Kim, 2021"
66,"Sep 23, 2021","POOR GUY GOT SMACKED AROUND LIKE A DANG PIN BALL, AND DOKJA STILL FELT THE NEED TO SLAP HIM WHILE HE'S DOWN. LMAOOOO"
66,"Sep 23, 2021","""Did I hit him too hard?""  Fam, you sent him ricocheting around that dome like a Smash character in Sudden Death."
66,"Sep 22, 2021","i want to believe that Jungyeok hates the mc so much , he subconsciously gave him that stare"
66,"Sep 22, 2021",god i love women especially huiwon
66,"Sep 22, 2021","yo, remember when they were on a train together?"
66,"Sep 22, 2021","i wonder what the bigger plot is. it looks like the constellations were once players, doesn't it? also the author's identity only gets more intriguing"
66,"Sep 2, 2021","Sometimes I pity Yjh for having a companion like Kdj, like Kdj almost killed him 😅. Well, Yjh did try to kill Kdj too.. but still "
66,"Sep 23, 2021",aw man the original novel had ping pong sound effects when dokja punched YJH. that was a funny description by dokja. this just has thud thud
66,"Sep 23, 2021","Dokja stays pissing off incredibly powerful beings like gods, royalty, supernatural beings, Yoo Joonghyuk, etc. "
66,"Sep 22, 2021","When the evil overlord starts saying how good a present he has for you and forces you to take it, you can tealize something is wrong"
66,"Sep 22, 2021",Got goosebumps when he said he refused to sit on the absolute throne. This is just his first story and it's already about to become even more epic!! Love seeing my favorite scenes from the novel come to life with the illustrations. 
66,"Sep 22, 2021","I love when a whole bunch of characters guard or band up with one character who is very much capable of taking care of themselves, but they all do it out of some extent of loyalty even if they started out as enemies cuz they believe in whoever the character is, and it's... UGH... It's so good"
66,"Sep 22, 2021","i literally got chills reading this chapter! everything from him defeating junghyeok (i was laughing so much at junghyeok's angry unconcious face 😂), to dokja's defiance and refusal to seat on the throne, and up to him calling the 7 stars of the big dipper!! oh man! im so excited for the next chapter!!"
66,"Sep 22, 2021","Dokja: investing a huge amount of coins to make Junghyeok immobileAlso Dokja: ""D-did I hit you too hard?""
🤦"
66,"Sep 22, 2021","Yup, Ganpyeongui is an OP item.I like the way how he criticize the historical constellations' manipulation of their own descendants to do their biddings instead of protecting them from the shenanigans of other dokkaebi and constellations."
66,"Sep 22, 2021",I'm mildly disappointed that Junghyeok wasn't shown like that old screensaver screen bouncing here and there in the dome after getting punched
66,"Aug 18, 2021","Eyo all I know is I'm in alliance with the plan ""screw this dokabi  the hardest so I can manipulate  him also"" it's a great plan "
66,"Oct 23, 2021","junghyeok was Dokja's main character, and dokja is ours."
66,"Sep 25, 2021","HUIWON RUSHING TO DEFEND HIM! and how the others join her, it felt like an Avengers assemble moment 🔥🔥🔥 the guys being like ""you are the real deal"", Sangah protecting her ideals, and the other two kings and constellations baking him up... EPIC    I'm just wondering where Sangah left their kid (i can't write his name, but you know) since he was unconscious"
66,"Sep 24, 2021","I started reading this to get free coins in an event.  But now I’m hooked.  Ive been reading this since the first panel came out, and this has been the most interesting manga/manhwa of read on this app.  Good work keep on getting the good stuff going"
66,"Sep 22, 2021",Huiwon best girl 😩✋
66,"Sep 22, 2021",I love watching Dokja piss everyone off
66,"Sep 22, 2021",So that means Dokja actually saved Jungyeok by beating him and making himself the king so he can destroy the throne. And the throne sounds pretty much like a trap for the King using it.
66,"Sep 22, 2021","Just slapping nearly dead junghyeok is giving him so much pleasure, even after losing all those coins... n I can see that! lol!!! - N YES, Aye aye DEMOCRACY!"
66,"Sep 22, 2021","Guy: sometimes it feels like your the main character 
Me laughs in irony"
66,"Sep 20, 2021","""I guess this is the only time I get to slap you"" he only slapped him once should've at least slapped him twice"
66,"Sep 19, 2021",i love how dokja just pisses everyone off 
66,"Sep 18, 2021",it really is one of the best manwa I've ever read thinking of reading the novel 
66,"Aug 20, 2021",Bro Dokja finally got the slap he wanted to do forever
66,"Aug 20, 2021",God this needs an anime
66,"Aug 19, 2021","This WEBTOON is so damn epic, what is the name of the novel it’s based on? It just gets better end better with every episode if that’s even possible to get better then it already is!"
66,"Aug 18, 2021",Dokja really always chooses the way that’s best to survive and humiliate Junghyeok at the same time and I’m absolutely here for it 
66,"Aug 18, 2021",knocked out junghyeok always looks so good wth 😂😂
66,"Nov 7, 2021",bro just insulted all the constellations. now he's calling them for help. gigachad
66,"Oct 20, 2021",God damn the art is so beautiful my god
66,"Oct 13, 2021",THIS GUY has found the MOST trustworthy COMPANIONS ever..
66,"Sep 26, 2021",Oh MY GOD I HAVE TO READ THE NEXT CHAPTER 
66,"Sep 24, 2021",As someone who has read the source material…WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED FOLKS
66,"Sep 23, 2021",This whole webtoon is just dokja pissing people off until they end up doing what he wants them to do lmaoo 
66,"Sep 23, 2021",Dokja to all Constellations and Dokkebi :🖕😃🖕
66,"Sep 23, 2021",Huiwon 's so underrated!! what a loyal and badass character ❤️
66,"Sep 22, 2021","So can the ""Constellations"" be anything from mortal kings to gods? If so, could there be a Zeus constellation or one that is similar to Ishtar? This is honestly just speculation, but if there were people who had their powers that would be pretty cool."
66,"Sep 22, 2021",HUIWONNNNNNNNNNNN
66,"Aug 24, 2021",Awwww is the wittle dokki-baby upset?? 😢 
66,"Aug 19, 2021",I'm broke now but it was totally worth it see Dokja defeat Joonghyuk with a single punch 😂😂😂 and take advantage of the situation to slap him nicely 😏😂 
66,"Aug 18, 2021","I love the influence Dokja has, in the end the effect he has on others and on the constellations  is genuine, this story is too good."
66,"Aug 18, 2021",HE'S JUST PING PONG-ING I CAN'TTTT
66,"Dec 20, 2021",i’m so in love with all the constellations siding with dokja and not the dokkebi 
66,"Nov 10, 2021",dokja you're so cool hand in marriage please
66,"Nov 8, 2021",Huiwon rlly said don’t you dare touch my brother 
66,"Oct 19, 2021",Huiwon best girl.
66,"Oct 17, 2021",Aww! Heewon blitzing to protect Dokja. XD
66,"Oct 15, 2021","I love the way his companions and friends and even other people he just met, stand with him and defend him. AND THE FIRST ONE WAS HUIWON 😳😛"
66,"Oct 11, 2021",I start to tear up every time [Secretive Plotter] appears 😭😭
66,"Sep 30, 2021",I miss the other dokkebi he was so cute 🥺
66,"Sep 25, 2021",a furious Dokkaebi is actually sCARY LOLLL
66,"Sep 24, 2021",dokja's personal attribute is to piss people off and still have friends

66,"Sep 23, 2021","everytime dokja and junghyeok meet, the latter passes out "
66,"Sep 23, 2021","I’m sorry, but I had to read this chapter twice. No series in my entire life has ad me this encapsulated before"
66,"Sep 22, 2021",Dokja is such a master of BS he sees that fine print on the throne coming a mile away
66,"Sep 22, 2021",meanwhile jungyeok is being step on
66,"Sep 22, 2021",..............im in love with dokja

66,"Sep 17, 2021","I used my free coins to get off a cliffhanger and I feel like I jumped into an arc where things get serious!! Dokja is really gonna cause uproar with the people, dokkebai and constellations!!"
66,"Sep 13, 2021","[Slight SPOILERS] Don’t worry Yoo Jonghyuk, you’re gonna feel better soon. Kim Dokja’s gonna make sure to have you well-fed with soup (by hand of course ^^)."
66,"Sep 10, 2021",junghyoek just unconscious on the ground the whole time lmao
66,"Aug 18, 2021",Yeah! Screw celestial bureaucracy!
66,"Sep 22, 2021","I can't help keep falling for Dokja, I admire him, the way he act and think. I'm so happy that he can rely on a nice team and other people supporting him too."
66,"Aug 18, 2021",[Your addiction has surpassed that of humans] [Incredible! 5 coins have been sponsored and now I'm stuck waiting to see what the stars do]

66,"Nov 14, 2021",I have a bad feeling that Dojka could face a major punishment from the Dokabies after he destroys the throne.

66,"Oct 3, 2021","Ahhh this chapter was so good... Dokja was so concerned for jungyeok after he hit him hard, him calling out people and constellations alike like put them all in their place, him going against all the logics of normal beings lol, my girl Huiwon shielding Dokja without any hesitation like a true warrior she is, and pissed off dokkaebi was such a great sight and satisfying, also stars shining at the end was epic and talking about epic.. next chapter is pure gold I'm sure 🤭🤭"
66,"Sep 30, 2021",Dokjas special ability is making enemies with the DMs
66,"Sep 30, 2021",Poor Junghyeok. He's going to be overwhelmed when he wakes up.

66,"Sep 22, 2021","not at Dokja slapping Junghyeok LMAOOO i love him so much!! he only read abt the characters and story and didnt experience it himself so it's really cool how calm he is, how he manipulates characters and how he's so close with junghyeok that he's slapping him rn"
66,"Sep 22, 2021",it's just funny that the dokkaebi have all the power and yet the main character somehow takes away power from even them.
66,"Sep 22, 2021",pissing off dokkaebi(s) is the point of this series hahahahha
66,"Sep 22, 2021",anyone else think this webtoon is underrated af?

66,"Sep 22, 2021","holy shit, i got goosebump! I love the twist!"
66,"Sep 22, 2021",That takes a whole other level a hate for Junhyeok to still be glaring with hate even when he's passed out
66,"Sep 22, 2021","At first I was like, “Dokja, too many people died for you to refuse that throne” and then I was like “oh shît you and more people will die if you take that throne” and that’s something jungheok only realized after his 41st regression"
66,"Sep 22, 2021",Dokja almost reminds me of like a veteran Dark Souls or Bloodborne player. Instead of taking the normal story route he finds a bunch of items hes not supposed to have to screw around with the game.😂
66,"Sep 22, 2021",That Dokkaebi boutta pop a blood vessel💀
66,"Sep 19, 2021",Well Worth the 5 coins to see the strongest character get his ass kicked

66,"Sep 16, 2021","Ah, every single time i read this my brain give me thoughts like ""Will this manhwa have 10k episodes and ill be the only one who will finish them like dokja? And the world will get crazy too?"" lmao"
66,"Sep 16, 2021","Wow, it takes a lot of courage for anyone to do this. Props to the kings who joined Dokja to destroy the throne."
66,"Sep 15, 2021","I, too, know how to use my coins"
66,"Sep 2, 2021",That first hit turned him into a dam ping pong ball xD

I know he has reasons to refuse, but only a very determined person could to that"

66,"Apr 23, 2022",that punch was satisfying 
66,"Mar 3, 2022","Omg I loved this chapter, I love how the characters didn't hesitate to gather around him to help him.

Episode,Date,Review
106,"May 25, 2022",Something about the little ‚Äú30 mins‚Äù exchange between them just hits different 
106,"May 25, 2022","EVERYONE LOOKS AMAZING THIS CHAPTER! Older Yuseung looks more and more beastly, Dokja and Junghyeok working together to have amazing attack combos, and the rest of the gang helping in is so cool! It‚Äôs really tying everything together!"
106,"May 25, 2022","That ""Punish Evil"" that kept repeating on Dokja's mind sure is intense and awful. It's like a madness that excluded everything other than the narrow definition of justice, a blind sense of righteousness that would punish all evils in the world. To think that the skill was originally used by the Valkyries during the Holy War against demons..WELL, TO DEFEAT A MONSTER, ONE MUST BECOME A MONSTER."
106,"May 25, 2022",I was so excited for her to join Dokja üò≠
106,"May 25, 2022","I feel so bad for Yuseong, forcefully turned into a monster because, what? Yhe dokkaebi wanted to make it more ""entertaining?"" Plus the ""Good"" Constellations encouraging him to fight despite that. UGH! Only the best authors can make me this angry and keep paying to read more XD"
106,"May 25, 2022",Wait‚Ä¶ so that means if her soul is on the line‚Ä¶ just how many coins do you think it‚Äôd take for dokja to buy it?
106,"May 25, 2022","I feel like I need to share this Dokja inner monologue after Joonghyuk avoids the Beast Lord's Breath lol‚Äî I felt genuinely impressed with Yoo Joonghyuk's combat senses.The disaster was a disaster but Yoo Joonghyuk was a monster. It was only Yoo Joonghyuk who could resist the disaster without the Judgment Time buff. He was a strong, cool, ruthless regressor. I was relieved that he was currently on my side."
106,"May 25, 2022",Fastest. Read. Ever.
106,"May 25, 2022",SEEING JOONGDOK TOGETHER IN ONE PANEL GIVES ME LIFE. THANK YOU LORD SLEEPY C üõê
106,"May 25, 2022","[Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" is overjoyed to see the people of Korea joining forces, rather than killing each other, 5 coins have been sponsored.]"
106,"May 25, 2022",okay the constellations of pure good alignment. how pure or good can they really be if they allow these games to happen??
106,"May 25, 2022",god i will sink myself into debt to read this webtoon 
106,"May 25, 2022","I missed last week's episode, so I'm appreciating Dokja's golden eyes and fur in here üò´üòîüíñ I literally did NOT expect the Beast King's Sensitivity suit him so well üò≠ HE'S SO HANDSOME"
106,"May 25, 2022","Reading the webnovel last year, this fight was when the story really started to click for me. It only gets better from here, this is just the starting line! "
106,"May 25, 2022","once again, the visuals are absolutely top notch. there's so much detail packed into every single panel. plus, all the elements at play here. fire, lightning, ice, water, good, evil, light scenes, dark scenes, I mean... Seriously, absolutely superb artwork yet again. This has been one hell of a battle and the story just continues to deliver perfection beat for beat every single episode. "
106,"May 26, 2022",The saddest thing about this chapter is that Adult Yuseung is crying while she's being forced to fight them.
106,"May 25, 2022",please let this somehow end with the mid level meanie kicked from the stream
106,"May 25, 2022",The two protagonists fighting together
106,"May 25, 2022","Dokja and Junghyeok communicating like a team after that 'He is my companion' scene.... 
....is just üíò"
106,"Jun 29, 2022","Although I'm enjoying the fight a lot, I didn't want this to happen. Having Yuseung on the team was a better scenario for me. But the constellations beg to differ. They want an action packed scenario..... I guess I understand how authors feel when readers straight up criticize their work & force them to change it to their likings. I'm also guilty. I felt poked at by ORV author a bit when this happened. "
106,"May 25, 2022","Man, I hope she lives. She didn‚Äôt really deserve that fate."
106,"May 25, 2022",am I the only one hoping that mid-grade dokkaebi gets smacked? 
106,"May 25, 2022","YOU KILLED IT WITH THIS GOOD TIER ARTWORK!!üëèüëèüëèüñ§üñ§‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüî•üî•üò± excellent job, keep up the good work. * excited observing constellation offers 5 coins*"
106,"May 25, 2022","The more evil Yueseung gets, the cooler she looks! "
106,"May 25, 2022",This is literally my favorite series on WEBTOON 
106,"May 26, 2022","I really didn't want to see Yuseong have to do this. It's wonderfully written and illustrated how tragic this is. She almost got a second chance, but the world isn't kind enough for that. Maybe Dokja can do the impossible, since he doesn't have to kill her as far as the scenario is concerned. It just seems like the constellations are getting sick of the Dramas and want their Action adventure "
106,"May 25, 2022",BOYFRIENDS
106,"May 25, 2022",OH MAN I WISH I COULD COMMENT THE SOUND I JUST MADE FOR THAT LAST PANEL
106,"Jun 29, 2022",UGH! THE ARTWORK IS SO GOOD!!!
106,"Jun 29, 2022",I love their little couple outfits
106,"Jun 29, 2022",I love how Dokja's coat as he activates the Time of Judgement skill resembles angel/fallen angel wings as if he's purifying the catastrophe 
106,"Jun 29, 2022","the ""30mins"" exchange got me all giddy for no clear reason"
106,"Jun 29, 2022",god I love his wings/jackect/feather mixuture thing
106,"Jun 29, 2022",What can I say? Couple goals.
106,"Jun 29, 2022","Dang, that‚Äôs a cool looking action sequence"
106,"Jun 29, 2022",holy hell the art in this chapter has topped everything so far 
106,"Jun 29, 2022",the breath of the beast king looks so terrifying!!
106,"Jun 29, 2022","Im feeling real goofy cuz I thought we‚Äôd see Huiwon this episode lmao. On a serious note, this episode was beautiful as always, the purple and black color scheme Yuseung turns to is so visually striking, makes the action look even better. "
106,"Jun 29, 2022",[The constellation of staying up to late is angry at the cliffhanger and is enjoying the character development.]
106,"Jun 29, 2022",help someone ship dokja & junghyeok
106,"Jun 29, 2022",So..... dokja and junghyeok can both last 30 minutes..... pretty compatible... nice
106,"Jun 29, 2022",dokja and junghyeok fighting together 
106,"Jun 29, 2022",i love that one panel with both of them & their matching black and white coats. they are giving ‚ú® ying and yang ‚ú® 
106,"May 25, 2022",Still hoping that the scenario stating defeat instead of kill leaves them with a choice ins one way-
106,"Jun 29, 2022",might be a constellation because i couldnt take my eyes off the fight either.
106,"Jun 29, 2022", Wait 7 days again to see this bloody fight.
106,"Jun 29, 2022","So the Time of Judgement ensures a win if the opponent is deemed evil. But somehow, Dokja still needs backup. Was he talking only for the monsters coming out of the gate or was he talking about getting backup for defeating Yuseung the catastrophe herself? That would be Junghyeok. If it's the latter, does that mean it's like you'll win as long as you try? As long as you put enough effort into it? It's really interesting."
106,"Jun 29, 2022",dokja & junghyeok fighting side by side is giving me LIFE
106,"Jun 29, 2022",Naruto and Sasuke vibes
106,"Jun 29, 2022",I will never get over how absolutely godly the action scenes are in this comic 
106,"Jun 29, 2022",Power couple moment
106,"Jun 29, 2022",This episode be hitting different. Like 1. The pose about two panels after he activated the judgement skill was a pure masterpiece and I stared at it for over a minute- 2. THE FIGHTING IS SO PRETTY AND FLUID AAAAGH- 3. The little time exchange between Dokja and Junghyeok was so casual and just the mutual understanding- ugh it gives me life
106,"Jun 29, 2022","Im remembering when they had to hide in the subway, when Dokja only jad 2 allies and they had to fight against groups of bad people. And now they are having national-level fight with intergalatical powers. Beautiful"
106,"Jun 29, 2022",The part where they asked each other how many minutes left they got was so cool.
106,"Jun 29, 2022",This is... awful. But necessary.
106,"Jun 22, 2022",this series is so freaking cool 
106,"May 25, 2022","well, this low key kind of a depressing chapter. amazing to look at but damn..."
106,"Jul 1, 2022",[the constellation queen of the binge readers has caught up with the series and is very sad to have to wait to read more]
106,"Jun 30, 2022",rip artists hands
106,"Jun 30, 2022",The artist really outdid themselves with this chapter !
106,"Jun 29, 2022","This saddens me so much, that she‚Äôs a puppet, been discarded by so many people and now that annoying, meddlesome guy forced her into being evil when she was for the first time being allowed to be herself rather than a catastrophe üò¢"
106,"Jun 29, 2022","Am I the only one that the more this continues the sadder it gets. Even doe its an epic fight the sadness in it its endless. Especially after the ""hope"" build up that came for 1 moment. Not sure how much more I can take from it.. haha"
106,"Jun 29, 2022","after the battle is finished, i want our mc to find a way to show the constellations and the dokkaebi just how pissed he is. i know I'd be."
106,"Jun 29, 2022",I hope that douche dokkaebi dies soon.
106,"Jun 29, 2022",I hope this backfires on the Dokkaebi jerk. He needs a permanent demotion.
106,"Jun 29, 2022","Everytime dokja and Junghyeok collabs ,my dose of excitement becomes 2xx.."
106,"Jun 29, 2022","""Because the thing in front of me now is clearly evil"" is it tho? It's not like she has control over her own actions right now"
106,"Jun 25, 2022",I just reread this part in the novel cause I didn't get what junghyeok meant about his 30 mins but apparently there's a backlash to using resuscitation? 
106,"May 25, 2022",This chapter felt so short but so packed with detail I‚Äôm excited for the rest of this arc of the story.
106,"May 25, 2022","AFTER GOLDEN EYES, WE'RE SWITCHING TO RED EYES. IS THIS ONE OF KDJ'S K-POP IDOL ERA?"
106,"Jul 10, 2022",bro these panels are just amazing 
106,"Jul 3, 2022",The art just went up a whole new level. Solo Leveling vibes.
106,"Jul 1, 2022",NOOO I DONT HAVE COINS
106,"Jun 30, 2022",Is it just me or does  Dokja and Junghyeok lot hotter than usual 
106,"Jun 30, 2022",the some constellations can't take there eyes away. that would be me
106,"Jun 30, 2022","Author, bless your beautiful soul. I looked at each panel for like 5 mins  the art and the story are so beautiful I just need to soak it all in. Bless. "
106,"Jun 29, 2022",HAHAHA THAT DOKKAEBI PAUL! JUST LAUGH ALL U CAN and ENJOY URSELF cuz LATER someone will BEAT ur ASS UP  TO SHUT UP!! 
106,"Jun 29, 2022",My biggest issue with this comic is I have to wait a week for the next part.  I'll be waiting with great anticipation on what happens next.
106,"Jun 29, 2022",complete and utter chills when the 30 minutes exchange happened; as well as the final image I got so many goosebumps 
106,"Jun 29, 2022",This is crazy good. Dokja and Junghyeok working together is top lol
106,"Jun 29, 2022",I feel like it's them agreeing to take her down in 29ü§£
106,"Jun 29, 2022",Holy shit what an amazing chapter. Action packed indeed
106,"Jun 29, 2022","i cant belive how it is drawn omg this is so detailed and amazing, feels like i am in the webtoon"
106,"Jun 29, 2022",it's really nice seeing kdj and yjh fighting together 
106,"Jun 29, 2022",This is going to be a wild 30 mins.
106,"Jun 29, 2022",The art in this chapter is so good
106,"Jun 29, 2022","you know what coins rly belong to this author. The art, the precision, the fresh plot, the details and THE ART ITS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING "
106,"Jun 29, 2022",wow
106,"Jun 29, 2022",On one hand I'm a bit disappointed that they have to kill her but on the other this is one hell of an action sequence
106,"Jun 29, 2022","This truly has been an amazing chapter. The way the action is drawn out, the special effects and atmosphere, detailed backgrounds, all the cast coming together to fight, and evil Yuseung's transformation. She looked fearsome just as the catastrophe, but now she does look like a devilish villian. I feel so bad for her forced to be like this, but I also can't look away. That panel of her and Dokja being mirrored, with his version of her power looking holy and hers looking demonic, was astounding."
106,"Jun 29, 2022",this chapter was so epic
106,"Jun 29, 2022",dokja and junghyeok are like yin and yang
106,"Jun 29, 2022",one of the best fights I've ever seen
106,"Jun 29, 2022",I'm going to have a twenty minute break. Working 12 hours is difficult. Hope we don't have to go overtime today.
106,"Jun 29, 2022","Realizing it now, I‚Äôd stan any interaction between Kim Dokja and Yu Junghyeok."

106,"Jun 29, 2022",They‚Äôre boyfriends your honor
106,"Aug 11, 2022",At this point I'm convinced the Judgement skill should be able to work with that dokkaebi as a target. Gotta be pretty evil to enjoy ruining Yuseung's chance at life
106,"Jul 12, 2022",I feel so bad for her ): she‚Äôs not evil. Just being taken advantage of and heart broken. 
106,"Jul 6, 2022",Their dating.
106,"Jul 4, 2022",what i wish for this webtoon is to last 10 years also
106,"Jul 3, 2022","all in favor of making this into an anime say I, I"

106,"Jun 30, 2022","I really feel bad for her, I was hoping that she'd have a chance at making it."
106,"Jun 30, 2022",I wish that Dokja kill the dokkaebi
106,"Jun 30, 2022",imagine if this webtoon ever gets animated 
106,"Jun 30, 2022","Best waifu Huiwon coming to Dokja's aid in spirit. Pretty cool that he gets to bookmark a mob character he rescued and nurtured. She sure turned into a beast. The Punish Evil panels were well done. You can feel the heavy, overwhelming, commanding feelings that take over one's senses when someone uses that skill. Poor Yuseung tho. She was wronged so much and now that she had a second chance, she was used as a pawn for entertainment üò¢"
106,"Jun 30, 2022",the fight between Yuseung and Junghyeok felt painful
106,"Jun 30, 2022",what was the point of crunchyroll buying webtoons if they aren't goign to animate all the amazing story's.
106,"Jun 30, 2022",I feel so bad for Yuseong forcefully turned into a monster and has to die in order for the other to move on to the next scenario üò≠
106,"Jun 29, 2022",That punish evil thing reminds me of Nightblood when you take him out of his sheath
106,"Jun 29, 2022",Did she just make a purple rasengan?

106,"Jun 29, 2022",[The unknown constellation faints from the 30 min exchange]
106,"Jun 29, 2022",With that sorta chemistry I‚Äôm surprised there isn‚Äôt an outright CP gag (but oof the two working together really gives me the most beautiful fights)
106,"Jun 29, 2022",honestly I'm quite jealous of those who have a  fast pass üòø
106,"Jun 29, 2022",This is so gay and I‚Äôm here for it.
106,"Jun 29, 2022",Well we know how this will go our duo going to beat her to save the day. Then they probably give Yusueng a pep talk before she is gone.
106,"Jun 29, 2022",IT DIDN'T TAKE TOO LONG TO REALIZE SOMETHING HAS CHANGED IN THE BACK OF MY MIND. 
106,"Jun 29, 2022","I've made a funny observation in which most of the top three are those that fast passes or paid via coins. This amuses me because it creates a sort of ""invisible"" line that stops most people who don't pay through."
106,"Jun 29, 2022","who else found this series when it was still long and said ""oh, i wont finish this entire series in 2 days"" but finished it in half"

106,"Jul 1, 2022",Ah... It really does hurt when you are on the website instead of the real app ...
106,"Jul 1, 2022","One thing I never understood about this webtoon is that Dokja and Junghyeok look so similar and now have even been dressing the same for a while. So why is Junghyeok considered attractive, but Dokja is only considered average or ugly by the other characters?  Their noticeable difference is just their eye shape and height. I don‚Äôt get it."

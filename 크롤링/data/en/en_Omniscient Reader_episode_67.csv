Episode,Date,Review
67,"Aug 25, 2021","I'm not sure I like the translation of Dokja's fable here. sure ""King of the World without a King"" is technically correct but ""King of a Kingless World"" sounds better. It's easier to say at least."
67,"Aug 25, 2021",The starts are beautiful at night aren‚Äôt they‚Ä¶In a **Kingless World ‚ú®üåå
67,"Aug 25, 2021","Please change ""ruler of the dark dimension"" to ""outer god"". The Aliens -> Outer gods we saw in ch42 was a mistake on the fandom's part, as the KR ver said Ïù¥Í≥ÑÏù∏Îì§ (people from another world), not Ïù¥Í≥ÑÏùò Ïã†Í≤© (gods from another world/outer gods). The real Ïù¥Í≥ÑÏùò Ïã†Í≤© appears in this chapter, but is now translated as ""ruler of the dark dimension"", which gives no context as ""outer god"" does. Edit: There's a list of LINE's mistranslations by u/lololwarrior, if you want to know all their mistakes so far."
67,"Aug 25, 2021",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' is looking at you.]
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Nobody can tell me this chapter wasn‚Äôt a movie I just watched in IMAX
67,"Aug 25, 2021",The constellations taking the burden from dokja was awesome it‚Äôs just letting you know even the constellations are much more interested in an alternate fable 
67,"Aug 25, 2021",The fact that he didn‚Äôt expect the constellations to share the burden and the fact they did is so cool and heart warming 
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Am I the only one who got literal chills when the constellations all teamed up to share the burden?
67,"Aug 25, 2021","I would love to play a game where an achievement popped with ""you've done something so rad and unheard of that we created this specifically because of you."""
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Dokja has achieved more in one regression than Junyeok did in like 80

67,"Aug 25, 2021","[The fable the king of the World without a King, has been created]. Guys, it's his FIRST FABLE. I'm getting emotional ü•∫ü•∫. This is the beginning. Super excited for the future chapter. [5 coins has been sponsored] "
67,"Aug 25, 2021",KING OF A KINGLESS WORLD!!!!
67,"Aug 25, 2021",This would make such an amazing anime. Which constellation do I have to pay to make that happen?
67,"Aug 25, 2021","God, I love this story. So many twist and turns yet so well written. 10/10"
67,"Aug 25, 2021","He's not the protagonist we were promised, but he's the one we got. All Hail the King of the Kingless!"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",This webtoon is so visually stunning that I just can't. Like the way those speech bubbles overlapped to show that the constellations speak simultaneously. Wow.
67,"Aug 25, 2021","As each constellation looked at him to share his burden, it made me tear up a little. Dokja making friends everywhere."
67,"Aug 25, 2021",CHILLS. LITERAL CHILLS. WORTH EVERY CENT.
67,"Aug 25, 2021","[The Constellation, LADY OF THE SINGULAR FOOTWEAR, is stunned into awed silence. 5 coins have been gifted]"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",I really enjoy seeing dokaebis get mad 
67,"Aug 25, 2021",I literally cannot throw money at my screen hard enough for this title. 
67,"Aug 25, 2021",If you didn't get goosebumps did you even read the chapter ‚úãü§®
67,"Aug 25, 2021",By far one of the best webtoons on this app
67,"Aug 29, 2021","There's a thousand titles that Dokja could have, and all of them are badass. But [King of the Kingless World] is better than all of them. [The Constellation Lord of the Bleeding Wallet is looking at the author][5 coins have been sponsored]"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Oh my God this chapter just gave me chills...that panel with Dokja under the rain is incredible!
67,"Aug 25, 2021",this series keeps getting better and better 
67,"Aug 25, 2021",So he just became his own constellation?
67,"Aug 25, 2021","[The Constellation 'Lonesome Dragon' believes King of a Kingless world sounds like a worthy title for Dokja, he wants to see the end of his story as well] [5 coins have been sponsored]"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",I do not regret spending the coins I have on this.
67,"Aug 25, 2021",BIG SHOUT-OUT TO YI SUNSIN [MARITIME WAR GOD] FOR BEING THE FIRST CONSTELLATION TO SHARE KDJ'S PROBABILITY!!
67,"Sep 29, 2021","The declaration of Dokja's fable in gold was so great! I was scared for the translation of the fable, and even though it is a bit of a mouthful compared to King of a Kingless World, I'm fine with it. If anyone was wondering, plausibility is the 'chance of something' happening, since destroying the throne by borrowing the constellation's powers has never been achieved before and is 'not plausible' to a point, Dokja suffers  adverse effects. Sorry if it's still not clear."
67,"Aug 26, 2021","i don't know man. king of a kingless world rolls off the tongue more smoothly but ""king of a world without a king"" sounds like a title of a story or in this case, a fable."
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Still thinking about how that little girl barfed up a flag pole
67,"Aug 28, 2021","""I will end the STORY of this world"" üò•ü§ó all along, he wanted to save his friends from becoming characters, remain human. POWERFUL WORDS! Now, they begin their own path üòÑ "
67,"Aug 27, 2021","Out of all of Omniscient Reader, the first Fable is probably my favorite, and this was an amazing adaptation.Definitely think the translator should stick with ""King of a Kingless World"" rather than the current, as some others have pointed out.
Also, I don' think it was meant to be Ruler of the Dark Dimension, unless that is going to be the official TL from now on. May need to clarify because that sounds pretty easily confusable with the Demons."
67,"Aug 25, 2021","that last panel has me feeling a jumble of emotions, his expression is just...I don't even have a word for it. I feel like I need to re-read from the beginning and make a glossary as I go cuz I know something big happened with the new fable being created but I feel like my brain isn't fully grasping the magnitude of it. "
67,"Aug 29, 2021",I got emotional when they started to share the burden. I‚Äôm such a big old baby. üò≠
67,"Aug 25, 2021",I can't explain how moving it was to see Dokja risk his life to show the constellations a new and better story. I couldn't say I would be willing to do the same. Be more like Dokja.
67,"Sep 23, 2021",The there is NO NEXT REGRESSION for me in this world really open your eyes that they won't have 2nd chance in life once their luck runs out.
67,"Aug 26, 2021","I know this is based on a novel so I really wanna go read it right now, assuming there's a translated version out there, but at the same time I know myself well enough to say that there's a 99% chance that I'll never return to this Webtoon if I do because my brain gets bored with repeating stories and I really REALLY wanna keep supporting this Webtoon!"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Wait‚Äîso has our boi gone from reader to author?
67,"Aug 26, 2021","This was so epic. The constellations coming together to help him, his speech about using the descendants for power. Everyone banding together and trusting him. Just... dang. I wasn't expecting all of this. So good! üî•üî•üî•"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",king of the world without a king is such a mouthful tbh
67,"Sep 29, 2021","I wasn't sure about Dokja as a protagonist because it felt like everything he was doing, no matter how good it seemed, was ultimately self-serving. Now we see what his real end goal was, not to survive, but to make sure the world makes it through. That's a hero worth believing in."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Imagine being so badass that you unlock a non-existing achievement and the universe creates a whole freaking FABLE in your name
67,"Sep 30, 2021",this webtoon has no reason to slap this much every single week
67,"Sep 29, 2021","To everyone asking for anime adaptation, According to this (https://www.starwatcher.com.tw/edm/orv/#) orv is getting an animated series, live action, and game adaptation. Webtoons official had confirmed it on their insta and twitter too, here's the link to the tweet (https://twitter.com/webtoonofficial/status/1343759419306176514?s=19). I think the author confirmed the live adaptation on their social media some time ago. Let's hope the adaptations will follow the source material faithfully. "
67,"Aug 25, 2021","I love this. This is the type of story I‚Äôve been looking for, to read. Drama, adventure, action, with emotional twist and turns. Great writing and great art, I just love it."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",this webtoon is a master piece.
67,"Aug 27, 2021",so... Netflix adaptation when?
67,"Aug 27, 2021",Tell me why I cried when they split the burden between them!?!
67,"Sep 29, 2021","translation mistakes aside, CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL THIS EPISODE WAS (AND HONESTLY ALL LAST 3 EP) I TOOK SO MANY SCREENSHOTS. I LITERALLY CAN'T COMPREHEND HOW THE ARTISTS DREW THESE. INLOVE YALL. I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE MY NON EXISTING FORTUNE TO THE ARTISTS. I just.. wow. just absolutely wow"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Okay, Dokja is starting to fight for that certain story he wants, to reach the epilogue he desires, and I am here for it. The stars shined brightly on the sky of the kingless world‚Ä¶ "
67,"Aug 27, 2021",Watching them share the burden and declare a new fable is just real. Even they are tired of this system and it's exploitation.
67,"Sep 30, 2021","i want ""king of a kingless world"" back please"
67,"Aug 29, 2021","Honestly this chapter for me atleast was probably one of the best so far in this series, he even looked surprised at the end, I just love it"
67,"Sep 30, 2021",King of a Kingless world just has a better ring to it‚Ä¶
67,"Sep 30, 2021",This man just keeps getting cooler and cooler üôÄ
67,"Aug 25, 2021","some of these panels of dokja taking on the plasibility storm is a bit like uh,, i wont say anything-"
67,"Aug 26, 2021","I'm gonna explain few things based on this webtoon version of translation so new readers won't be too confused, do correct me if I'm wrong:Constellations known to have 3 levels; highest is Mythical (means Myth-grade), next is Fabled (means Fable-grade), last is Historical (History-grade). Term ""Fable"" used in this chapter is not referring to Constellation's grade but the essence of someone's power in ORV. When one's achievement is significant and recognised by Star Stream, they earn a Fable. "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",DOKJA YOUVE ALWAYS BEEN A KING IN MY EYES ü•∫ü•∞üíï
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Ok. So 'fables' were called 'stories' in the novel. Earning a fable does not equate becoming a fable constellation. All constellation have accumulated fables, and incarnations can accumulate fables as well. The accumulated fables make up the constellation's power in their case, and that's why their ranked- usually by how well-known their fables are. I saw a few people getting confused over this, I don't have the biggest issue with the translation change but it's starting to cause confusion."
67,"Aug 25, 2021",did this seem short? I know it wasnt short but it seemed short...am I just being greedy? I want more...here are my 5 ü™ô...I will pay more üò≠
67,"Sep 30, 2021","The last panel is so beautiful. You can see the pain on his face, but his determination is strong."
67,"Sep 30, 2021",So we all agree that King of a Kingless World sounds so much better and that‚Äôs the translation we‚Äôll be using right? 
67,"Sep 30, 2021","I BLESS EVERYONE THAT ARE INVOLVE IN THIS WEBTOON TO HAVE CLEAR SKIN, GOOD MEALS, AND MAY ODDS BE IN THEIR FAVOR AT THE END OF THE DAY. THANK YOU FOR THIS MASTERPIECE"
67,"Aug 25, 2021","And so the story begins. This feels like the prologue. Now I am excited to see how each character develops their abilities, new constellations to be introduced and the wonderful new items ! Thank you for this great adventure üíô"
67,"Sep 30, 2021",who else had Goosebumps when the constellations started looking down on him? 
67,"Sep 30, 2021",King of a Kingless World just hits different why does the novel names and fan translated always hit better üò©
67,"Sep 30, 2021",Wow I got goosebumps. Thank you for this
67,"Sep 30, 2021","having not read the book, i am LOSING my shit here"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","I appreciate the people correcting the translations, but sometimes I just want to go to the comments and talk about how cool the chapter was. Most of the time I don't even care about the miss-transaltions"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Round of applause for this episode üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè Goddamn that was amazing
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This episode was REVOLUTIONARY. THANK YOU AUTHOR :D
67,"Sep 29, 2021",If he becomes important enough could he become a constellation 
67,"Sep 22, 2021","The writing, the story telling, the climax, and the ending of this one episode is just utterly outstanding. Chills, just chills. It's so beautifully written and I'm not going to miss a single bit of this, because it's amazing."
67,"Nov 12, 2021","i got rising chills as more constellations looked at him, god i love this webtoon "
67,"Oct 13, 2021","chills, literal chills from this chapter"
67,"Oct 6, 2021",King of the Kingless World
67,"Oct 4, 2021","""you have achieved a nonexistant achievement."" Yeah,  that sounds plausible. "
67,"Oct 1, 2021",I was mesmerized by the way they stacked the speech bubbles to indicate there are multiple voices but damn I didn't expect that emotional scene at all..... got me teared up with the togetherness trope lmao I'm weak with that trope. But seriously how dokja can think of anything so clearly every time is a bit too OP lol I don't think I could react like him even if I got isekai'd to my favorite mmorpg that I've played for 8 years. Surely I'd make a lot of blunders and doubting myself lol
67,"Oct 1, 2021","MY HEART- Please, I wish everyone who has Webtoon reads this. It deserves every single adaptation known to mankind for being so fcking amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
67,"Sep 30, 2021",Man this series Rocks!!!! I legit started to tear up when the constellations saved him.  
67,"Sep 30, 2021",The GUY just unlocked A HIFDEN ACHIVMENT!
67,"Sep 30, 2021",Damn what a good chapter
67,"Sep 30, 2021",I love the subtle change of the raindrops on the title/logo.
67,"Sep 29, 2021","I know translating webtoon is hard, so thank you for your effort despite the barrage of criticism, but I'd hoped the translators take care with the research and the phrasing more...? I've noticed several times that some choice of translations removed a good chunk of foreshadowings. it makes me sad."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",what kind of anime finale heartstrings pulling shit is this??? how DARE you make me emotional?!!
67,"Sep 29, 2021",A feat so great that you are awarded an achievement that doesn‚Äôt exist. That‚Äôs beyond true gaming. 
67,"Sep 8, 2021","Although the webtoon's translation is okay, there's so much mistranslation and better words they could've used. ""King of a World without a King"" is one big missed opportunity to just put ""King of a Kingless World"" as it sounds better. Idk about the other translations but I hope webtoon could hear out the readers and use the right/better  translation. "
67,"Sep 2, 2021",I‚Äôm not crying your crying 
67,"Aug 26, 2021",man Binyeongs streaming channel must be soaring through the roof i wanna see his reaction 
67,"Aug 25, 2021","As strong as this chapter is, there are some things it can be improved on, translation wise. Like 'King of a world without a king' would have sounded better as 'King of a Kingless World' because during the last 5 players involved yeah they were kings but are they still after losing, since there is only supposed to be one King in the end to take the throne but he destroyed it. So the other 'kings' wouldn't be kings anymore after losing, if I saw how the event worked. "
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Damn! Actual chills at the end there
67,"Oct 24, 2021",One of my favorite chapters. The art was gorgeous and the pacing and paneling was done really well
67,"Oct 12, 2021",that was beautiful...
67,"Oct 6, 2021",when you become the main character üò≠üò≠
67,"Oct 5, 2021","*wipes tear* I'm waiting for you in the ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†, Dokja ‚ú®"
67,"Oct 3, 2021","I literally cried at the end, it's so damn good, and as a novel reader who loves this story heartily, the importance of this fable and the emotions I felt this chapter... ahhhh it was soooo good.. the only thing I didn't like is the webtoon using ""king of the world without a king"" instead of ""king of kingless world"", I feel so attached to the latter. And all these stars/constellations sharing the aftermath of plausibility is heart warming, I also like how his friends were so worried for him "
67,"Oct 3, 2021",All the top comments are about translation mistakes are we not gonna acknowledge how fucking badass that was
67,"Oct 2, 2021",he made all the constellations so intrigued by him that they want him to live ‚úãüò≠
67,"Sep 30, 2021",This arc is so beautiful. 
67,"Sep 30, 2021","The constellations are watching a show run how they‚Äôve never seen it run before! They‚Äôve grown to like him and his interesting tale..watching him die would bring only sorrow for them, so they‚Äôre helping him live; they can‚Äôt allow their show to end, a show with it‚Äôs most interesting character gone is no longer as interesting or special."
67,"Sep 30, 2021",I like other translations better ‚Äúking of a kingless world‚Äù
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Dokja ""I'm going to do what's called a pro gamer move.""Proceeds to destroy major plot device. Intern creating a brand new story."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",why did this feel so so so uh idk how to explain but like powerful
67,"Sep 29, 2021",did anyone else cry when the constellations shares the plausibility? no? just me? ok
67,"Sep 29, 2021",holy shit the last panel... beautiful 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Whoever said Dokja wasnt hot is wrong
67,"Sep 25, 2021",SHEEEESH this chapter gave me literal chills.. Dokja is so COOLüò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
67,"Aug 26, 2021","The first tale of this story has been aquired. I'm getting goosebumps. 
The fact that the webtoon art is still so stellar not only does the novel justice but brings more depth and heightens expirence in a story that captures first readers and the novel readers. Seeing what wasn't described and what was. Rereading at its finest. üëå"
67,"Nov 15, 2021",Dokja you might not be a King there but in our heart you are the King of Kingsüëë
67,"Nov 12, 2021",I got chills 
67,"Oct 16, 2021",damn i actually teared up this chapter was so good!!!

67,"Oct 9, 2021",I got chills seeing the constellations share his burden whoa this story is so good
67,"Oct 3, 2021","should have use ""King of a Kingless World"" but regardless, this chapter always gives me chills üò≠"

67,"Sep 30, 2021",bro this was the best episode
67,"Sep 30, 2021",Anyone else just feel extremely satisfied with how every little action and choice Dokja made has lead to this glorious moment? Cause I'm just floating on cloud 9
67,"Sep 30, 2021",those constellation poppings are really giving me goosebumps
67,"Sep 30, 2021"," ""Stars. I can see the stars again, m'lady‚Äù like if you get it ü•≤üò≠ü§ö"

67,"Sep 29, 2021",When the constellations started looking at him one by one... Oh god that scene was awesome !!
67,"Sep 29, 2021","I know the majority of manhwas/comics are based off of light novels but I think this is one of the first where I‚Äôve been willing to read the actual light novel. The plot did that much of a good job. Props to singnsong tbh, this story is absolutely amazing, probably the best on this app period"
67,"Aug 29, 2021","I CANT FUCKING WAIT, I WANT MOREEEEEEEEEEEEE"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Again the illustrators come with amazing adaptation of the text to image. I love how they display constellations speaking to Dokja.

67,"Sep 30, 2021","I waited literally all day for this. It did not disappoint. This is my favorite web toon. The art, the plot, the character development-- all of it. Just amazing. Thank you author, for making my day a little better. ‚ù§"
67,"Sep 30, 2021","Author, Artist and all of those that helped make this chapter a reality... thank you very much"
67,"Sep 30, 2021",love the chapter but i honestly prefer ‚Äûking of a kingless world‚Äú and ‚Äûouter gods‚Äú a lot more as possible translations
67,"Sep 30, 2021",King of a kingless world... 
67,"Sep 30, 2021",m imagining a Netflix series lol
67,"Sep 30, 2021",The storytelling of this webtoon is unmatched! Each chapter tops the last! They need to adapt this into an anime asap üî•üî•üî•
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This is why Omniscient Reader is my favorite webtoon
67,"Sep 29, 2021",absolutely stunning. from art to story. magnificent.
67,"Sep 29, 2021",it somehow made me a lil emotional when all those screen messages of the various Constellations showed up helping him burden the plausibility. dokja is pretty amazing 
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Don't worry about the blood, folks! It's just internal bleeding, and internal is where the blood is supposed to be anyway."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",the art is just *chef's kiss*
67,"Sep 29, 2021",even the constellations wants to see the Dokja's story!! and now he has a FABLE! A Kingless World ‚ú®
67,"Sep 29, 2021","im a novel reader but i think yall too pressed about mistranslations.. unless it really disrupts the plot/understanding, its not much of a big deal?"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",err...why not just say king of a kingless world? it's easier and that's how they refer to it in the light novel.
67,"Sep 29, 2021","this is one of my favourite scenes in the novel, the moment when dokja made his first step towards the ""end"", the moment the concept of ""probability"" was first introduced, the moment dokja became ""King of the kingless world"", the moment everything started going downhill.... to all that are reading this for the first time, prepare yourselves. because not even the [Fourth wall] can save you from the hardships that's gonna come in the following arcs. ORV' true ""story"" starts here!"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","For those who are confused what is fable, think of legendary/mythical heros. They have their own story/fables becoming a heroic beings like Hercules going through 12 labors, Odysseus trojan horse, Sun Wukong starting a war against heavens. It is their achievements that show their strength and spread their reputation. In ORV, such stories are called fables and this fable system is very important, directly related to constellation/incarnation‚Äôs strength."
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Damn y'all being picky with the wording. Enjoy the story either way ya salty scrubs. Yo, Dokja is SUCH a BADDIE!! Literally the Constellations love him so much, or at least respect him so much, that they were willing to SHARE PAIN with a MERE HUMAN. Dokja truly is incredible."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",DOKJA IS SO PRETTY LOOK AT THAT LAST PANEL AHHHHH
67,"Sep 29, 2021",My man just weaves out a new storyline.
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Make your own path, blaze your own trail. Believe in yourself."
67,"Sep 29, 2021","This is by far the best webcomic on webtoon in my personal opinion, keep it up"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",The art in this chapter was amazing‚Ä¶ author started out with great art style and it‚Äôs only gotten better and better with each episode. Wow! 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",this gave me chills. 
67,"Sep 29, 2021","This has been an amazing series thus far, but this chapter has pushed it into legendary territory. Bravo, author."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",the grip dokja has on my soul
67,"Sep 29, 2021",That was so fucking cool. 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",i got chills when the constellations helped dokja.. that was so cool! 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Got goosebumps when the constellations started to share the burden of plausibility....
67,"Sep 29, 2021",this episode felt so cinematic i got shivers reading it 
67,"Sep 23, 2021","Wha... WHAT?!?! This is just too much, I can't even find the words to say how much I love this story, it just blows my mind EVERYüëè SINGLEüëè CHAPTERüëè and I'm living for it. Omniscent Reader is just amazing."
67,"Sep 13, 2021",The Naval warefare god is a real one for being the first to share the burden. The Bald army general probably helped as a way to pay dokja cause he dosen‚Äôt have many coins
67,"Aug 30, 2021",omg üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ this was so beautiful. 
67,"Aug 28, 2021","My man really knows what's what, this is what makes him an awesome character"
67,"Aug 26, 2021","I'm loking at you, Dokja ‚ù§"
67,"Aug 26, 2021","i hoped they kept the title ""king of the kingless world"" from the novel for me it sounds better. Also, at the end the title panel should've been kinda smudged or wobbly coz the artist intended for it to be that way, to give it a crumpled/sad/lonely effect. To add with the feeling of the rain and Dokja's condition at the end. The artist gave a good adaptation so i just think it's good to honor their efforts, now it just seem like some of it's wasted."
67,"Aug 25, 2021","I hope this isn‚Äôt ending any time soon, I feel like it‚Äôs only really started."
67,"Aug 25, 2021","It's been quite some time since I was so impacted by a story... A New Fable, Dokja's story to tell... Thanks Author, Artists and all collaborators for this amazing tale!!!"
67,"Oct 1, 2021",The fucking GOAT 
67,"Sep 29, 2021","i miss our initial broadcaster, this one is so buthurt and angry all the time"
67,"Sep 29, 2021"," He really is such an amazing character. The Gods respect him, he beat the strongest man, he defied the rulers of scenarios, he broke the system into rewarding him with a non existent achievement, he, a mere human, became the highest rank of constellations, and most importantly, he created the ending he wanted and became The King of a World Without a King."
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Talk about a hard-core stargazer‚Ä¶.
67,"Mar 24, 2022","When the constellations started to share his burden you can just tell that they aren‚Äôt just in it to be entertained anymore, they really want Dokja to survive because they can‚Äôt comprehend him"
67,"Mar 20, 2022",that was quite the cinematic experience
67,"Jan 15, 2022","Dokja, you majestic b*stard üò≠ "
67,"Jan 5, 2022","""a mysterious ruler has noticed a sudden chance in this world"" shouldn't that be ""change"", not ""chance""?"
67,"Dec 24, 2021","I've completed the novel but seriously I'm so emotional to see him create his first fable. üò≠üò≠ King of a kingless world, his first big achievement. "
67,"Dec 19, 2021","Man, I straight up got chills, while I'm loving every single episode this one just hit me different. Why can't I live more than one like? üò≠ "
67,"Dec 17, 2021",this episode brought the thrills and the feels.....
67,"Dec 10, 2021","Quite an astonishing moment, I would not lie. Beautiful "
67,"Dec 10, 2021",I'm just gonna leave this comment here so I can come back and remember this chapter.
67,"Dec 5, 2021","This chapter made me emotional. They shared the burden T_T even though constellations are beings who treat human life like worms, this was very humane for them. üò¢ "
67,"Nov 16, 2021",okay but who's still amazed by everything??ITS ALL SO GOOD AND PRETTY AND SPECTACULAR-
67,"Nov 14, 2021",these last four chapters are what made me the fan of this series
67,"Nov 13, 2021",SO BEAUTIFUL
67,"Nov 12, 2021",woah.....
67,"Nov 11, 2021",Okay but hear me out. What if Dokja is the author of TWSA but he doesn‚Äôt know yet?
67,"Nov 11, 2021","Dokja might not be the protagonist of TWSA, but he sure is worthy to be the protagonist of this web comic. Super epic episode omg "
67,"Nov 5, 2021",Ah it brought me to tears how the constellations helped him üíõüíõüíõüíõüíõü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤
67,"Nov 4, 2021",the writing is top tier dear lord

67,"Oct 8, 2021","i'm amazed at this fanbase, people have a good eye for mistakes in the translation. AND I'M AMAZED AT THE END OF THIS EPISODE SKDHDLFJKD DOKJA WHAT ON EARTH JUST HAPPENED"
67,"Oct 8, 2021",I honestly would love it more if they translated it to King of a Kingless World cause that would be more memorable. 
67,"Oct 7, 2021","Ok but the fact that Dokja is the definition of ""Good evening,God has let me live another day and im making it EVERYBODY'S problem"
67,"Oct 7, 2021",Now that‚Äôs a fable I can enjoy ‚ÄúA king in a World without a King‚Äù. Catchy let‚Äôs see where this King can go on his grand crusade!
67,"Oct 6, 2021","I was gonna read the next chapter, but I just had to re-read this one, and the chills remain intact aldjaldjsjdjd"
67,"Oct 6, 2021","ah yes ""king of a kingless world"" the most powerful fable to have ever existed"
67,"Oct 5, 2021","Dark Dimension? Nah, it sounded cooler when it referred to them as Eldritch. Ooh, the first probability storm! Truthfully, Dokja is probably the only one other than Junghyuk or Sooyung who could even survive it right now. And the first Fable‚Ä¶ now this was the moment things changed. "
67,"Oct 5, 2021",Holy shit that's-I...uh- it's amazing!
67,"Oct 4, 2021",i am so in love with this story.
67,"Oct 3, 2021",Woahhhhh. I am left speechless. This was beautiful.
67,"Oct 2, 2021",woohooooo.dokjaaa soooo coool
67,"Oct 2, 2021","""WE'LL USE THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP"" "
67,"Oct 2, 2021",The Constellations all jumping in there at the end to protect our boy was just so beautiful. 
67,"Oct 2, 2021",That was the most incredible chapter I've ever read. This story is VERY interesting. I can't wait to see how the story unfolds.
67,"Oct 1, 2021",THAT WAS DOPE
67,"Oct 1, 2021",So what‚Äôs his story he wanted to tell?
67,"Oct 1, 2021",holy hell I have goose bumps this episode was so insane new fable baby!
67,"Oct 1, 2021",Those constellations are homies for sharing the probability.
67,"Sep 30, 2021",wow i finally catched up üòçüò≥
67,"Sep 30, 2021",Doesn‚Äôt this mean Dokja is himself a constellation now? Or has the potential to become one?
67,"Sep 30, 2021","Wow...I love this comic in general for it's world building, art, and story - but this is the first time Dokja has seemed so heroic vs. pragmatic, as he was willing to risk death for the slight chance the world could be saved. And the stars setting sail *chills!*"
67,"Sep 30, 2021",I don't really understand what just happened but Dokja is like a legend now rightü§©
67,"Sep 30, 2021",That was amazing!! Feels like a new arc will begin soon...it's going get even more epic isn't it
67,"Sep 30, 2021","if yall think this is good, just you wait. it gets even better "
67,"Sep 30, 2021",This was full and completely serious Dokja. Shit actually got real. I'm stunned by this episode.

67,"Sep 30, 2021",Wow I really love this webtoon! Dokja being the King of the Kingless and what he did is really cool! I can't wait to see how else he will surprise me in the future! 
67,"Sep 30, 2021",my fav manwha of all time
67,"Sep 30, 2021",THE LIMBS I WOULD SELL JUST TO WATCH THIS ANIMATED
67,"Sep 30, 2021",The constellations could have benefited from their incarnations getting the Fable. But they still chose to share Dokja's pain because they support what he did üò≠
67,"Sep 30, 2021",NOW THIS IS THE KIND OF WEBTOON THAT DESERVES TO BECOME A MOVIE OR A SERIES.....
67,"Sep 29, 2021",King of a Kingless World sounds way more badass ngl.
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Goosebumps and sadness when Dokja said he only has one shot at his ending 
67,"Sep 29, 2021","THIS IS SO GOOD!!!! MY FAVORITE STORY EVER!! I‚Äôm in love with every single one of these characters, my heart and mind is racing. This is what I want to do. I‚Äôm in love with everything about this. Thank you"

67,"Sep 29, 2021",i got teary-eyed when the constellations shared the burden. and mooooore teary-eyed when dokja achieved something unfathomable. i felt so proud.
67,"Sep 29, 2021",favorite story on webtoon rn üõê
67,"Sep 29, 2021","This chapter was amazing, I usually never leave comments on webtoon, but this will be my first since 2 years of using webtoon. This was amazing, it left a great impact, and I believe the story is progressing beautifully."
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This was a BOMB chapter üëåüèæüëåüèæüëåüèæ
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Dokja be snatching constellations left and right 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",A king indeed. Danm. The constellations certainly have a favorite. XD
67,"Sep 29, 2021",THIS. IS. A. MASTERPIECE.
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Y'all. I couldn't wait for the updates so I read the translated comic online. When I caught up to that, I read the entire web novel. it took me two weeks, filled with endless laughter and tears. It's long, but written the way you'd read a webtoon. I highly suggest fans read the novel to get your fix!"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SOMEONE ANIMATE THIS SERIES 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",King of a kingless word sounds much better. A world without king? Cheesy af
67,"Sep 29, 2021",please change it to king of the kingless world.. it sounds much cooler and thats how it is in novel. plus ruler of dark dimension= outer god (make it this way it will make sense in future)
67,"Sep 29, 2021",one of the memorable chapters
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Yellow box? I assume this means it is a higher ruling authority than the system used to create the blue boxes.
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Remember when this was just killing bugs? I've been here since episode one and damn things change so quick
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This chapter was amazing!*^*
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Time to go get some free coins I can‚Äôt handle this cliffhanger..
67,"Sep 29, 2021",The fact that Dokja got basically all the constellations on his side and created a new fable is really something. It really shows you don‚Äôt need a sponsor to win the favour of the constellations!
67,"Sep 29, 2021","the constellations are actually seeming to be pretty good now, huh. I NEED MORRRRE"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","i needed a moment for that to sink in, i was just sitting, staring unblinkingly at my screen, not even reading the top comments that i had just scrolled to. applause for the author, i was literally speechless"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Thank god the constellations intervened.. My respect for them increased...
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I very much enjoyed this
67,"Sep 29, 2021","""King of the world without a king"" oof. King of a Kingless world sounded better. Either way some dope shit coming up"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","The 'King of the world without a king'... I still prefer the 'King of a Kingless World'. I hope they don't change the names like what happened in the translation in the novel in between cause it's going to be a mess. And the Outer Gods too... Sigh. Anyways, but still, I LOVE THIS SCENE! Yes it's the beginning! It's starting!!! Though I'm 8 chapters ahead in the Manhwa. Still I support. Lezzgo! "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",‚ÄòA mysterious ruler sees his chance in this world‚Äô ‚Ä¶now whos this?
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Every chapter of this Webtoon is a gem. This chapter gave me literal chills. The fact that the constellations heard his wish for how he wanted to change the story and rewrite it, they're invested and they are looking out for him. That's such a big feat. To have the constellations following your story. Man, dokja and his gang really came through. "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Yall what just happened?????????
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I want to read the original TWSA just to compare it to this cause I feel like the significance about some of this stuff is downplayed by our lack of knowledge of how things should be going in the original TWSA and how the world works
67,"Sep 29, 2021",meaning the story in the first world should have ended when he takes the throne? so dokja managed to not end the story in the first world therefore no regression therefore part 2 ? 
67,"Sep 29, 2021","I was astonished, enthralled,happy, scared, bewildered,Proud  throughout the chapter!!! A total package!!!... Kim Dokja,what a amazin character he is !!!!"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",AHHHH I WISH I HAVE MORE COINS I CANT WAITüò≠
67,"Sep 29, 2021","dokja went to so many places, did so many things but at the end is still wearing a jacket... give my mam some clothes please üòÇ"

67,"Sep 29, 2021",Wow...this actually made me speechless for a bit. (Even with some mistranslations)
67,"Sep 29, 2021","even with a bit of the mistranslations, this chapter WAS SO GOOD!!! "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",yall are complaining about translations and stuff but it's still a dope ass novel just enjoy it
67,"Sep 29, 2021","just remembered, where has Gilyeong been this whole time?"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",it's just sooooooo cool!!! the power of storytelling !!! saving a story and having the viewer save you!!! a story gains its power from what its readers want!! the levels . the layers . ough
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Damn, Dokja really willing to die for this. "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",T- T can't help but love these constellations for supporting Dokja.. got bit teary there. Can't wait to see what's next o-o
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This episode is gorgeous!! The art the story!!! Just wow!!!
67,"Sep 29, 2021","i do hope this gets an anime, cause the scene in this episode with all the constellations is BEAUTIFUL."
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Oohh, did y‚Äôall notice that the title got rain drop stains?? "
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Please listen to the people who say that King of a Kingless World is better, because King of a world without a king is quite possibly the worst thing to say and read in the history of reading and writing."
67,"Sep 24, 2021",my heart stopped for a moment. I thought this was the end. üòüüò≠ü•∫
67,"Sep 24, 2021","It looks impressive to me that Dokja was willing to die (or at least suffer a tremendous pain) just for the sake of ""saving"" the world. "
67,"Sep 23, 2021","That is.. Just awesome. I am so grateful to the author for giving us such a beautiful, funny, epic and tragic story. It has been a long time since I haven't loved a fiction that intensely. Thank you so much. I can't wait to see what is in store outside Seoul now. "

67,"Dec 26, 2021",ngl dokja be lookin pretty sexy in that last panel
67,"Dec 26, 2021",BEAUTIFULLLLL CHAPTERRRR
67,"Dec 18, 2021","This is supposed to be the official translation, why so many changes? Like I already don't like it when they change the King of No Killing and some skills now it's King of the Kingless Word? It kinda ruins the story since names like those are important details. Please don't change more than you did already because I'm scared that the iconic demon king‚óºÔ∏è‚óºÔ∏è or ‚óºÔ∏è Company or the Sacrificial ‚óºÔ∏è will be changed. Like, at least choose more fitting alternatives if you need to change the translation. "
67,"Dec 15, 2021",It made me shed a few tears that Dokja was able to touch the constellations enough for them to decide to share the plausibility with him. He changes the people around him
67,"Dec 10, 2021",damn this chapter was incredible
67,"Nov 27, 2021","nah this should defiantly get crunchyroll to do anime for this webtoon, this is a webtoon where you dont need to fully understand the history cause you learn about it while rooting for these characters, i can't stop stressing when dokja does something i think is stupid and win, i know he will win but it always make me feel like he'll lose, this is too good to not get a anime"
67,"Nov 20, 2021",that last panel </3 dokja my king of a kingless world

67,"Dec 26, 2021",BEAUTIFULLLLL CHAPTERRRR
67,"Dec 18, 2021","This is supposed to be the official translation, why so many changes? Like I already don't like it when they change the King of No Killing and some skills now it's King of the Kingless Word? It kinda ruins the story since names like those are important details. Please don't change more than you did already because I'm scared that the iconic demon king‚óºÔ∏è‚óºÔ∏è or ‚óºÔ∏è Company or the Sacrificial ‚óºÔ∏è will be changed. Like, at least choose more fitting alternatives if you need to change the translation. "
67,"Dec 15, 2021",It made me shed a few tears that Dokja was able to touch the constellations enough for them to decide to share the plausibility with him. He changes the people around him
67,"Dec 10, 2021",damn this chapter was incredible
67,"Nov 27, 2021","nah this should defiantly get crunchyroll to do anime for this webtoon, this is a webtoon where you dont need to fully understand the history cause you learn about it while rooting for these characters, i can't stop stressing when dokja does something i think is stupid and win, i know he will win but it always make me feel like he'll lose, this is too good to not get a anime"

67,"Sep 30, 2021","Is Dokja going to become a Constellation, specifically the Constellation King of a Kingless World??"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","One of the best episodes, so far"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",this is the best webtoon ive ever read
67,"Sep 29, 2021","I much prefer ""Star Relic"" over Constellation Artifact. The later may be accurate but the former just rolls off the tongue better. Considering what they use to fight in this story, I think it's better to condense what you can. Future fight scenes are going to be quite a mouthful as is which is why I also agree with the top comments. "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",i can't even begin to say how much feelings this comic gives me?? this is illegal. 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Why not just keep using King of a Kingless World?? It sounds a lot better
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I want to see it animated !!!

67,"Sep 29, 2021",I like how the title is smudged by raindrops! A small but nice feature to match the scenery!

67,"Sep 29, 2021","Goosebumps on that last scene, this is super good "

67,"Sep 29, 2021",Holy sh***t that was amazing!!!
67,"Sep 29, 2021",wait.... did he become a constellation!? but he should be a mythical not fabeled (or whatever the most powerful one is!!!!!) he deserves to be at the top.. I hope he can make his way up still
67,"Sep 29, 2021",YEAH DOKJAAAAAA UR SO BADASSSSSSSS WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOO
67,"Sep 29, 2021",king of a kingless world is such a better title. its the original translation from the novel
67,"Sep 29, 2021","The translation feels so bad, It is in consistent, there is complete lack of flow, every name feels clunky and forced, i starting to think that some trash translator company was hired to translate this webtoon, it is has level of some intern who is non native english speaker which finished his education in middle school. "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",NO!! they changed it from ‚ÄúKing of a Kingless World‚Äù TT
67,"Sep 29, 2021",man it's annoying how many mistakes are made in these translations 
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Holy craaaaap it just gets better and better!! Good job to all the people working on this masterpeice!! WOOOOO
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This story is so wonderfully done. Dokja has gone from being a reader who never chose to be anything more to someone willing to give everything up to tell the story he wants told. Beautiful writing.
67,"Sep 29, 2021",dokja look thicc in the last panel üò≤üòâ
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Honestly I'm at my wits end with Webtoon translators. It's getting progressively worse. As a novel reader I cringe at many of the choices they've  made. Ruler of the dark dimension? No it's Outer God. King of the World without a King""- FFS NO King of a Kingless World."
67,"Sep 29, 2021","goosebumps, seeing this scene drawn was amazingüò≥"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I want to read novel BUT it's way TOO long and I have VERY short patience üò≠
67,"Sep 29, 2021",KING OF A WORLD WITHOUT A KING LETS GOOOOOO
67,"Sep 29, 2021","King of a Kingless World sounds much better tbh, kinda wish whoever was translating this took some liberties. Sure, what was said was accurate, but it certainly does not roll off the tongue.Either way, pog! Fable 1 acquired!"
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Dojka managed to exceed my expectations once again üôÇ and the constellations helping him almost made me tear up tbh
67,"Sep 29, 2021",D-Dormamu?
67,"Sep 29, 2021",This had me in tears.It was so breathtaking. And How is anyone even going to survive through the scenario if they haven't read .This is basically made so that no one survives right ?

67,"Aug 27, 2021","Yo,  this is SO F'ING GOOD "
67,"Aug 27, 2021",I don't think this episode is worthy of 5 coin like this ep is so heart warming and emotional
67,"Aug 27, 2021","I love this comic sooo much.... the extremely pissed off look of the White furry two horned gremlins face when Dojka was pretty much saying ""f*ck off I do what I want"" was funny as HELL... but... someone please take the time to read this and answer my few questions that I got cuz I didn't understand why the White furry gremlin was mad as HELL about the throne situation.... and I have a few questions to ask y'all. so please go and look at the questions in the replies sections some one please help"
67,"Aug 27, 2021",It‚Äôs so good!

67,"Aug 25, 2021","Gosh that was so amazing!! I, too, would like to see the end that Kim Dokja wants ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",Wait are we seeing what I think we are seeing? ‚ÄúA new fable has been created‚Äù and the name ‚Äúthe king of a world without kings‚Äù does this mean Dokja is becoming a constellation himself or am I reading too much into this?
67,"Aug 25, 2021",THAT WAS EPIC
67,"Aug 25, 2021","wow. I'm in awe üò≥ I'm really curious how redice would interpret this chapter into drawing format, and initially I thought they will do it in grand, amazing, and 'wow' art like in other manhwas when the MC achieve something big. but they use 'emotional approach' instead, and while it can be a lil bit underwhelming, for me it just fits well in this chapter context, especially when you already know what this chapter really is about and its implications; it made this chapter 999 times more sadder"
67,"Aug 25, 2021",I fast passed all the way here and I don't regret it one bit. when the constellations shared burden of plausibility with dokja I almost shed a tear. 
67,"Aug 25, 2021",that was so goood!!!! I can't wait to see see the art with the story. it's such a good story and just keeps getting better!

67,"Aug 25, 2021",literally got chills when reading a 'new fable' was created. been such a long time since a story could get such a reaction from me. well done author and artist (and translater) 
67,"Aug 25, 2021","I'm obessed with this! I love it ! Everything in this chapter was priceless and utterly awesome, long live to the King of the kingless world !! ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®"

67,"Sep 29, 2021","Dokja created a new Fable, does this mean that he now transcends higher than a normal humans with lower constellations?

67,"Sep 29, 2021","After reading this chapter, I remember a certain quote in the back of my mind. Dokja destroying the throne and Constellations watching has made him leave a strong legacy in changing everything. Their world, their fate, and their future. It is this quote that became the representation of what Dokja stand for so that people will not lose hope in their darkest hour. This is Dokja‚Äôs legacy. ‚ÄúThis is where your story begins.‚Äù"
67,"Sep 29, 2021","Will Dokja end up becoming a constellation himself? The constellations gave him a title, and even a fable about Dokja was created... it seems he might atleast achieve something similar to a constellation's level of power even if he doesn't become a constellation."

67,"May 20, 2022",now that i think about it reading the 'original' three ways to survive the apocalypse would be quite epic to read. I somehow find it exciting how jungheok or some other character must've figured out how some of the items work or where to find them by trial and error

67,"Oct 30, 2021","""King of the world without a king"" yup, that's Dokja alright"
67,"Oct 30, 2021","so......if he started a new fable, doesn't that mean after he dies he could become a constellation?"

67,"Sep 29, 2021","I like this story a lot, but I think it illustrates the concept in Eastern culture that I would call 'secret knowledge'.You know, like in many Japanese games you would profit a lot from knowing smth from guides outside of the game. Or if you're playing it a second time. And like that in this scenario there was nothing from which you could've come to conclusion that the throne is so dangerous. It was totally indeductible from prior knowledge. "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I want to know what does the author usually mean by constellations? As sometimes even the stars are mentioned as a constellation like in this chapter.

67,"Sep 29, 2021",Ok but the water droplets on the name
67,"Sep 29, 2021","So the reason Dokja destroyed the throne is that if he sits on it, this world ends. So only the one who sat on it will go to the next regression and everyone else die (except Jung hyeok since he‚Äôs the main char of the world?)? Am i understanding this right? "
67,"Sep 29, 2021",Man that was insane
67,"Sep 29, 2021",I legit thought he was gonna die

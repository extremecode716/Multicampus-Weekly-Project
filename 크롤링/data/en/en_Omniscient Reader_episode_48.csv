Episode,Date,Review
48,"Mar 31, 2021","“With my looks, I guess I could pull it off” humble brag~KDJ"
48,"Mar 31, 2021","Oh god...it's the start of Dokja's Joonghyuk roleplay. Lol nice save from Heewon & we love a confident Sangah 😍. A bit sad we didn't get to see Sangah act as vice-representative at the station before they left like in the novel 😔. Also, a detail they didn't have here is that the person Dokja argued w/ online was a Kim Namwoon fan lol"
48,"Mar 31, 2021",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' had its back hurt from laughing too much about this act.] [The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' is currently out making popcorns.] [5 coins have been sponsored.] 《Edit 04012021: Happy birthday to our queen HSY🎂 !!》
48,"Mar 31, 2021","Dojka....Junghyeok is gonna being even more mad if he finds out about this, which I want to see tbh"
48,"Mar 31, 2021",I love Heewon's & Hyunsung's surprised Pikachu faces 😯 It's gonna be an enjoyable roller coaster of reactions in the background for them as Dokja roleplays
48,"Mar 31, 2021",Dokja is the ultimate weeb who never stopped reading and supporting TWSA lol
48,"Mar 31, 2021",IDENTITY THEFT IS NOT A JOKE DOKJA! 
48,"Mar 31, 2021",I just need more of Huiwon calling Dokja “ Your Majesty” it made me giggle 
48,"Mar 31, 2021",Pildu really coming in clutch playing tower defence
48,"Mar 31, 2021",So it seems like anyone who read TWSA will have similar profiles but he gets the skill he has for reading the whole story.
48,"Mar 31, 2021",kim dokja's shit-eating grin oh my godddd why is he like this
48,"Mar 31, 2021",dokja thank you for being dokja honestly

48,"Mar 31, 2021","""With my looks, I guess I could pull it off"" I strive for that kind of self-confidence 🤣😎 I really hope Junghyeok finds out about Dokja impersonating him, his reaction would be priceless"
48,"Mar 31, 2021",Huiwon best girl but Sangah is vice best girl
48,"Mar 31, 2021",dokja is so smart! I love seeing him use his superior knowledge of the situation against people who think they know best
48,"Mar 31, 2021",me: *casually on netflix* also me *checks time* “OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS GOD I AM 9 MINUTES LATE!”

48,"Mar 31, 2021",Dokja is the God of Thunder. Also the God of Trickery lol. He's Thor and Loki's offspring.

48,"Mar 31, 2021",chapter 33 of waiting for yoo sangah in a black chinese dress and garter belt
48,"Mar 31, 2021",Dokja is getting more badass and I'm living for it
48,"Mar 31, 2021",Lmao. Wait till the other people find out that Dokja is an imposter 
48,"Mar 31, 2021","i screamed so loud when dokya lied about his name, i love how witty he is"
48,"Mar 31, 2021",So it’s like capture the flag but with death as a penalty.  That’s got to be rough.  
48,"May 19, 2021",he totally lowered his voice when he decided to be Junghyok yu
48,"May 19, 2021",BESTIE YOU LOOK LIKE WALMART JONGHYUK
48,"May 19, 2021",Imagine Yoo Junghyuk waking up and discover not only that the girl thinks they are a couple but also that Dojka's been using his name to get his way😂😂
48,"May 19, 2021","This was GOLDEN. He's like ""Well they read it too but we don't know EXACTLY what he looks like...with my looks and stats I guess I can pull it off""🤣"
48,"May 19, 2021","Dokja really said ""I can pull this off, I'm pretty af✨"" skskbfoansjdjnid I'm living for this impersonation tho, if anyone can pull it off, it really is him"
48,"May 19, 2021","those anime eyes thooo ""I'm handsome 👁👄👁"""
48,"May 19, 2021",I LITERALLY LAUGHED SO HARD BECAUSE OF THE HANDSOME PART AND THE WAY THEY WERE SCARED OF HIM AND DID NOT KNOW HE IS NOT ACTUALLY JOONGHYUK LMAOO
48,"Mar 31, 2021",Man went from being a king to a demon! 🤣
48,"May 19, 2021",dokja is that one reader that wants to be the mc
48,"May 19, 2021","HUIWON MY BELOVED ✨ she's hilarious with the ""Your Majesty"""
48,"May 17, 2021",His face when he pulled the sword. Awesome 
48,"May 19, 2021",Can we just take a moment to appreciate how epic Dokja looks when he's unsheathing his Unbreakable Faith?
48,"May 19, 2021",seeing Sangha get super happy made my heart melt
48,"May 19, 2021",The fact that he’s been impersonating as ‘Yoo Jonghyuk’ when he was 15 makes him a natural 
48,"May 19, 2021",I’m really happy that he has trust in sangah bc she would never betray him
48,"May 19, 2021","Sir, you're giving yourself too little credit. You're VERY handsome."
48,"May 14, 2021",So Dokja is saying Jungheok Yu is like a brother to him bc of twsa. He feels like they are family and jhy's journey was his journey too. 😊 BUT 😁 I doubt those who ship them will believe that 🤭
48,"May 19, 2021",Dokja KNOWS for a fact that he's one pretty boy and that he has simps 🥵
48,"May 19, 2021",“My name is Junghyeok Yu” Heewon and Hyunsung👀👀
48,"May 19, 2021","""With my looks, I could pull it off"" my boy has confidence, knows his worth 😌"
48,"Apr 7, 2021",The face Sangah made....well....guess her character is gonna get a lot more interesting 
48,"May 19, 2021","Sangah smiling, Hyunsung blushing, Dokja role-playing/committing identity fraud, Heewon playing along, that's it, that's the comment 😌👌"

48,"May 19, 2021",Yes yes you are very handsome 😳
48,"May 19, 2021","one day I was smiling while reading a webtoon..my sister who got suspicious asked me sister:who is it? me:there are so many..which one u wanna know? sister (surprised Pikachu face):How many guys are u dating u idiot? me:wut??u r talking about guys not webtoon??and I ain't dating anyone dummy..u can check it if u want"" after she saw my phone,she cooled down and got interested in webtoon..now there are two webtoon nerds in my house whom my mother wanna beat..(ㆁωㆁ)"
48,"May 15, 2021",Dokja is beauty at its finest✨
48,"May 12, 2021",remember to comment and like every episode so that the artist will help you survive the apocalypse. Thank you for this episode! I look forward to finishing the series
48,"Apr 29, 2021","I am reader of the story Omniscient Reader, and I know the future. Kim Dokja let me warn you, YOU CANT PULL IT OF WITH THE LOOKS YOU HAVE 😂"
48,"May 19, 2021",IM SORRY BUT HIM ACTING TO BE HIM IS KILLING ME HE DOESNT LOOK ANYTHING LIKE JUNGHYEOK PLSSSSS
48,"May 19, 2021",NO I DONT ACCEPT YOO SANGAH SLANDER SHE IS NOT AT ALL SUS please she's just grateful that she 'finally got to do something' for the team she was lowkey beating herself up for not being helpful enough like where did you guys even thought of that? and here i thought ysa would be appreciated more in this chapter turns out i was wrong😔
48,"May 19, 2021","""I am Yu Joonghyuk"" This golden phrase will never get old"
48,"May 19, 2021",I love how cocky Dokja is haha
48,"May 19, 2021","Chapter one : I am trash . 
A few chapters later: with my looks I guess I could pull it of."
48,"Mar 31, 2021",The way some constellations think they have something and now he is role-playing... Oh dear
48,"May 19, 2021","I can’t believe how much Dokja has grown, in the first episode he was so smol, down on himself, and got so flustered by Sangah just sitting next to him. Now he’s in control of his life and he had to lift her spirits up this time. She looks up to him now. I hope to see their relationship grow even more"
48,"May 14, 2021","came here for free coins, stayed for an amazing story! this part is just *chefs kisses*"
48,"May 20, 2021","[Dokja has activated the ""Bullshitting"" skill]"
48,"May 20, 2021",Dokja be like..... I am somewhat of a Protagonist myself
48,"May 19, 2021","""someone has used search attributes on you""
dokja: no thanks"
48,"May 19, 2021",I love how smart Dokja is about everything— like why waste time fighting this group when you can just impersonate someone you know they’re intimidated by?
48,"May 19, 2021",Did Dokja actually blush after shaking Sangah's hand? 👀
48,"May 19, 2021","Don’t worry Dokja, you’ll forever be the ‘Beautiful King’ in my books. 🥺"
48,"Mar 31, 2021","Even if this comic gets 1,000 chapters I'll read them all. :) Then again these are comics not text like TWSA but I've certainly been known to read a good long book too."
48,"May 21, 2021",Only Dokja would be wild enough to impersonate Junghyeok 
48,"May 19, 2021",Sangah's getting some appreciation 🥺🥺 my heart-
48,"Jun 4, 2021","So now Dokja is now Junghyeok's lover, brother, and also is him lmao"
48,"May 20, 2021",When bae is sleeping so you go in his place to take over other stations
48,"May 19, 2021",ALSO THAT SCENE WITH THE SWORD HELL YEAHHH
48,"May 19, 2021","i really liked dokja character from nerd to savage person ,wow he was very handsome, not lying and when dokja eyes turned blue he really looked like mc from solo leveling, i was really surprised 😂"
48,"May 12, 2021","""with my looks I can pull it of."" well he is pretty good looking though😺😹"
48,"May 21, 2021","(I'm just theorizing so pls don't flag me for spoiling if it's true)It would be one hell of a twist if the main hero is actually Dokja, since he's introducing himself as Junghyuk, eventually everyone knows him as that instead of his real name so ironically he was reading about himself the whole time."
48,"May 20, 2021",dokja is one of my favorite protagonists and this chapter proves it
48,"May 20, 2021",sangah's creepy smile?? i thought it was cute
48,"May 19, 2021",Huiwon and Hyeonseong’s reactions to Dokja’s bluff tho 😭😭 so funny. This webtoon is truly awesome. 
48,"May 19, 2021",dokja was so sexy for this
48,"May 19, 2021",Honestly this is one of the best webtoons I’ve read so far 
48,"May 19, 2021",Kim dokja can pull off anything 😌👏👏👏
48,"May 16, 2021",Mmmmm yes Dokja is handsome enough to pull it off!! and anybody who thinks otherwise can meet my fists Q(`⌒´Q) 
48,"May 20, 2021","“Your Majesty, your word is my command”her sarcasms 🤣💀👏🏻"
48,"May 19, 2021",what do yall mean its foreshadowing of sangah turning evil? I CANNOT ACCEPT THIS SLANDER. DIDNT YALL SEE HER SMILE? ITS SO PURE 🥺🥺 
48,"Apr 3, 2021",dude ngl when he counted to 3 I choked- I'm simping for him more. ❌🧢 
48,"May 22, 2021",Hyeonseong looked SO panicked when Dokja started pretending to be jeonhyeok I can’t stop laughing 
48,"May 20, 2021","The amount of knowledge we gain from these webtoons on how to be smart is something they don't teach in school. People may say it's a waste of time but it's useful, at least according to me."
48,"May 20, 2021","For once, out of the many comics I've read, the MC is like, ""Yeah I guess I'm pretty good-looking."" "
48,"May 20, 2021",lmaoooo the way he's just pretending to be the main character... that's real confidence
48,"May 19, 2021",We all know they won't get over with the 'Your Majesty' thing
48,"May 19, 2021",i love this overconfident little shit lmao. its beautiful IM WHEEZING
48,"May 19, 2021","Honestly tho, I get sad whenever I recall that Kim Dokja seriously treats Yoo Joonghyuk as his parent, his brother, his friend, his mentor and his hero because he had no one but him :((("
48,"May 19, 2021",Junghyuk got brother zoned 
48,"May 19, 2021",Dokja pulling the sword out with his eyes glowing was pretty hot ngl
48,"May 17, 2021",sangah getting flustered was so cuteee🥺
48,"Sep 15, 2021","can we talk about despite proclaiming himself as hypocrite and manipulating, Dokja is such a nice person. he believes in his team and even shared his authority with Sangah. no wonder the team likes and trusts him with their lives."
48,"May 20, 2021",And so begins the start of Dokja’s habit of identity theft. Also Jung Heewon subtly bullying Dokja was hilarious. 
48,"May 20, 2021","lol the other two when he lied about his identity.
""YOU ARE WHO?! WHEN WAS THIS?"""
48,"May 19, 2021",he was so confident about his looks LMAO
48,"May 19, 2021","So the more they read, the better skill they got. Wonder what skill the last reader besides our mc has?"
48,"May 12, 2021",DOKJA IS SO ATTRACTIVE I CANT
48,"Apr 3, 2021",Is this some sort of self-insert fan fiction inside of a work of fiction?!
48,"Apr 1, 2021",man Dokja is scary when he wants to be 😳
48,"May 21, 2021",I cannot stop laughing the thing about this webtoon is that everything Dokja does is pretty much ridiculous but they are always meticulously planned and they WORK this WEBTOON is so freaking good
48,"May 21, 2021",dokja looking a lil too good this chapter .. 😟
48,"May 20, 2021",dokja acknowledging hes handsome yessir you indeed are
48,"May 20, 2021",Gotta love how the only reason Dokja thought he could be a convincible Junghyeok was because of his good looks 🤣
48,"May 20, 2021","I like stories like Omniscient Reader and Unholy Blood. Not that their plots are similar because they are NOT whatsoever, but because they have such strong, capable, and fascinating main characters/leads. Characters like these in this genre are some of the greatest characters to read about"
48,"May 20, 2021",he bluffed so damn hard
48,"May 20, 2021",can't wait for the 3rd potagonist entry
48,"May 20, 2021",dang imagine you are literally the coolest dude and strongest in the world (junghyeok yu) and then you find out there are people running around that know everything about your life and every move you have made
48,"May 19, 2021",I see a lot of people describing Sangah's smile as a smirk? Idk why but for me it looked more like she was holding back tears from being touched that Dokja had given her that role after she was worried she wasn't able to contribute much? 🤔
48,"May 19, 2021",Dokja: He's like a brother to me... I hate him.
48,"May 19, 2021",So the group who calls themselves the prophet are just readers of twsa... it makes sense 
48,"May 19, 2021",dis man is so cool and powerful. I'm not a simp or anything but like...DO YOU UNDERSTAND
48,"May 19, 2021",Dokja acting as the protagonist he wasn’t wrong about the looks tho 😭😂
48,"May 19, 2021",he shall forever be made fun of as your majesty 
48,"May 12, 2021",figured secretive plotter would have something to say about him acting as junghyeok
48,"Apr 28, 2021","not the shojo manga eyes, Dokja ! 😂😂"
48,"Mar 31, 2021",Dokja is so badass
48,"Jun 2, 2021",PLEASE let junghyeok find out about this 💀💀💀
48,"Jul 16, 2021","It's pretty funny to see that he's aware that he's good-looking. I mean, he ain't lying though. 😌👌"
48,"Jun 3, 2021","Handsome... Well, where's the lie? 🤩"
48,"May 20, 2021",Dokja please step on me i'll pay you
48,"May 20, 2021",I NEARLY FELL OFF MY CHAIR WHEN I READ THIS. DOJKA OUR GAMBLING PROTAGONIST XD
48,"May 20, 2021","Dokja looked like a demon in one of those shots, and Heewon's and Hyungsung's suprised faces!! lmao"
48,"May 20, 2021",Dokja knowing that he is handsome af. We stan a confident man.
48,"May 19, 2021",the amount of confidence dokja has damn i can never 😅 also dying from heewon and hyeonseong's faces because of dokja's bluff 😂
48,"May 19, 2021","Huiwon is gonna wear that ""Your Majesty"" ALL the way out 🤣🤣"
48,"May 19, 2021",Huiwon teasing Dokja about being a king is what I live for right now
48,"May 19, 2021",great chapter! seeing hyenseong and huiwon reaction to dokja roleplaying is priceless! something you wont see in the novel
48,"May 19, 2021",I always love how clever Dokja is.
48,"May 19, 2021",i just like dokja and his big brain energy kkk :D
48,"May 19, 2021","I mean- Dokja is handsome, ngl"
48,"May 19, 2021",bruh moment! you know dokja been waiting for this all his life xD
48,"May 19, 2021","Dokja has ascended, he knows what he's doing"
48,"Apr 29, 2021",Loving the conniving way Dokja is about to crush his fellow readers who didn't dare to stick with the story. Use that knowledge as a weapon!
48,"Apr 9, 2021","Love how Dokja is like I can pull off looking like Junghyeok Yu. 😂😂😂 Thank goodness he is good looking, too. Dokja is cute and handsome while Junghyeok is sexy and handsome. Dokja reminds me of the MC from Solo-Leveling webtoon."
48,"Apr 7, 2021",Dokja: My name is....Me: LIE! LIE DOKJA! SAY HIS NAME!!! SCARE THEM!!! DO IT DO IT DO IT!!! *SCREAMS* 😆😆😆
48,"Mar 31, 2021","I’m surprised he’s expecting the leader of the station to be an in-book character instead of another reader, just like his situation."
48,"Mar 31, 2021",YOU DARE APPOSE ME MORTAL
48,"Jun 4, 2021",Mc literally pulled off the “I’m sexy and I know it” 🤣 
48,"May 26, 2021","I know this is really late, but I have a theory that secretive plotter is the author of TWSA."
48,"May 23, 2021",In one of the earlier chapters I said that I don’t understand why people ship dokja and jonghyuk. I have back to say that I take back my statement. bruh the bromance. I repent for my past comment 🙏 (also read the novel it’s so good)
48,"May 21, 2021","i really love dokja so much hes so smart but also sooo funny LMAO and then, huiwon knowing whats going on and hyunsung being the innocent himbo he is xD and miss yoo sangah yesss u go girl <33"
48,"May 21, 2021",“He’s supposed to be incredibly handsome” “I guess I could pull that off” -Dokja
48,"May 21, 2021","Dokja is handsome and that’s facts but I thought Dokja would be the type to not know that he himself is handsome, pleasantly surprised tho"
48,"May 21, 2021","Umm did Dokja just say the Hyeonseong was in an all boys school, did engineering and then went into the army???👀👀"
48,"May 21, 2021",I knew he knew that he knows that we know that he knows and we also believe he is handsome. Just never expected him to say it lol
48,"May 20, 2021",is it just me or dokja seems to get hotter every episode?
48,"May 20, 2021",LMAO THOSE TWO REACTIONS WHEN DOKJA LIED XDDDDD
48,"May 20, 2021",when the walmart version gets his chance in the spot light: 
48,"May 20, 2021",LOORD HAVE MERCY WHY WAS DOKJA ESPECIALLY HOT IN THIS EPISODE 
48,"May 20, 2021",LMAO Dokja has successfully taken over Junghyeok Yu's identity 
48,"May 20, 2021",Went from bf Junghyeok to brother Junghyeok real quick😳😳 Sweet home Alabama 😂
48,"May 20, 2021",Dokja & Junhyuk need to join hands they would be unbeatable 
48,"May 20, 2021",LMAOO HE'S ROLEPLAYING
48,"May 20, 2021",One thing I don't think has occurred to Dokja is that the other readers may not have been as discrete as him about the source of their knowledge
48,"May 19, 2021",HOLY- AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO SHIPS SANGAH AND DOKJA?
48,"May 19, 2021",I'm surprised none of the constellations chimed in or awarded him for his plan
48,"May 19, 2021","I love the story but just so y’all know, I will keep reading this even if it starts to suck just to survive the apocalypse "
48,"May 19, 2021",okay admittedly dokja is really handsome and cool 😂
48,"May 19, 2021","Haha how clever, Kim Dokja "
48,"May 19, 2021",THE IDENTITY THEFT HAS STARTED!!
48,"May 19, 2021",That was badass
48,"May 19, 2021",Don’t lie when Dokja made Sangah and she smirked like that you thought she was gonna pull a Kabuto 
48,"Apr 29, 2021",DOKJA IMITATING JUNGHYEOK IS SO FUNNY AHAHAHSJS 
48,"Apr 2, 2021",Take my coins pls 🥲💸
48,"Mar 31, 2021",Bluffing got Dokja so far. I know it’s gonna backfire and get him in deep 💩 in the future 
48,"May 19, 2021","When they called him ""Your Majesty"", i imagined Hinata calling Oikawa and Kageyama ""Your Majesty"", ""Great King"" and ""The King of the Court"" XD."
48,"Mar 31, 2021","I really enjoy the way the relationships evolve, let's appreciate ""your majesty"" here."
48,"Aug 27, 2021","yes dokja, you're handsome. yes."
48,"Aug 8, 2021","In the novel they say something along the lines of ""I thought he was handsome though..."""
48,"Aug 5, 2021","😂 I love Huiwon teasing Dokja by calling him ""your Majesty"" and everyone else subjects. She's honestly one of my favourite characters in this webtoon 😁"
48,"Jul 17, 2021",PLEASE HE KNOWS HE IS SEXY AF 😋
48,"Jun 2, 2021",THIS WAS SO FUNNY LALSKDDHHSLAJDKA 
48,"Jun 1, 2021",HE LOOKS SO HOT GAWD
48,"May 22, 2021","Just want to say, I just read the very last chapter of the web-novel. First off, that in itself, is an achievement on my part. And second, I am not at all disappointed. Love the novel, love the webtoon. Hope it goes all the way till the end 💪🏼"
48,"May 21, 2021","And this year's Best actor goes to-
KDJ"
48,"May 21, 2021",Dokja..... That was so incredibly disrespectful. How dare you look so good counting?? I'm calling the cops
48,"May 20, 2021","okay, so I love how this was changed. In the original webnovel, Seongguk is very confused because, while Dokja is strong enough and has his Jonghyuk impression down to a science, he is labeled as ""ugly"" or at least not handsome enough. Yu Jonghyuk is described in the novel as extremely, if not unearthly, handsome. He is able to stun gods, angels, and other dieties with his appearance. Dokja? No so much. This will make my favorite joke not as funny."
48,"May 20, 2021",‼️‼️YOO SANGAH PROTECTION SQUAD ‼️‼️she’s a good girl don’t assume she’s bad from one panel
48,"May 20, 2021",Guys please like the chapter it helps out the author out a lot with making these amazing chapter it just feels bad to see the likes going down every chapter. Let’s get this WEBTOON back to the top❤️
48,"May 20, 2021",The chapter was finished before I knew it.
48,"May 20, 2021",The moment they focused ONLY on his smile I knew he was going to do something crazy 😂
48,"May 20, 2021","Yeah so Dokja is so cunning though. Like before he was outsmarting ""characters"" but now he's outsmarting audience members."
48,"May 20, 2021","Ok, About this whole ""Prophets"" thing, so I get that they are actually readers of TWSA and all, but how much of the story is just in the first 50 chapters? not to mention, that most of the readers didn't even make it past the first 10 chapters, so there is probably only a few people that actually know what happens past that. so how much of the story can there be in just the first 10 chapters?"
48,"May 20, 2021",[The constellation bookloving dragon of the void feels very entertained by your scheme] 
48,"May 20, 2021",dokja's confidence in his looks I can't 😂
48,"May 20, 2021","That ""Grin"" moment was priceless"

48,"May 19, 2021","I know this comment is going to be so lame coz that's not even a mildly related to this genre but dang, I'd love for Dokja to find a romantic interest as a side arc. There are so many issues this novel takes on, be nice to see some post apocalyptic lovin'😆"
48,"May 19, 2021","i'm just waiting for Sangah's chinese dress and garter belt but first....Sangah in a catsuit don't forget that!! Also, why are people sussing Sangah out? Her smile is so pure i'm gonna save that whole panel of her for collections. She's also the sweetheart of the group. Oh and go Dokja flexing that loyal reader superiority!!! "
48,"May 19, 2021","Huiwon: ""How do you know that prick on the roof top so well, Dokja"" ME: JIHYE WILL ANSWER THAT FOR YOU"
48,"May 19, 2021",damn dokja can get scary 
48,"May 19, 2021","Hyunseong's earnestness vs. Huiwon's sarcasm is gold. Hyunseong genuinely meant that question when he asked if he should call Dokja his majesty lol, he's so refreshingly adorable in that world of murderers. It's even more funny that he's more innocent than even Gilyeongie, whos the kid but still always asking Dokja if there is any dirty work he should be doing "
48,"May 19, 2021",sangah looks so happy and confident I love this woman so much
48,"May 19, 2021","Haha, dokja really looked at the amateur reader and said “u have no idea... hehehe”"

48,"May 24, 2021","I have spent the last 10 days binge reading the whole web novel for this. I really like it, and I love how it’s portrayed in the WEBTOON.

48,"May 21, 2021",Dokja’s so damn hot 
48,"May 21, 2021",To be honest what I'd do if I even read part of that novel then it came the new reality would be to never meet the MCs EVER. Like it even tells you how crazy they are right so I would pay to be an extra more than anything. But I don't know if I would submit to them if we met I'd just try to avoid them at all costs.
48,"May 20, 2021",hahahaha the way the two of them look at Dokja🤣🤣
48,"May 20, 2021","I haven't even read the webnovel version of this, and I just KNEW Dokja was going to pretend to be Joonghyuk. And Dokja admitting he was hot was amazing. His fabulousness is overwhelming."

48,"May 20, 2021","Now THIS is what I like about this series. Dojka, using his knowledge, pulling off extremely risky plays in order to get the advantage. Nitpick though; I'm pretty sure this version changed TWSA from a web novel to a webtoon, so wouldn't Junghyeok's looks be shown, not described?"
48,"May 20, 2021","It started off like a lot of shows did at the start of season 2, and it's progressively becoming more and more like the wholesome first series. This plot is very unique. "

48,"May 19, 2021",i was in class trying so hard not to start laughing uncontrolably lmao
48,"May 19, 2021",I'm surprised that the story didn't have many readers... Was it available right from the start only to a select few or something? Because I know a lot of stories that have thousands of chapters and yet a lot of fans.

48,"May 19, 2021","Idk why, but I got a suspicious vibe from Sangah's smirk right before she said she would do her best with her VP powers. And I feel like it's foreshadowing that we met another group's VP which Dokja stated could hand over stations to other leaders. Very possible Im thinking too deep but I can't shake this weird vibe. It would actually be a cool twist if Sangah (who didn't make it in the actual TWSA story) ended up being a new villain."

48,"May 19, 2021",ultimate poker player
48,"May 19, 2021","I just wish Dokja would use his mind reading skill again, every once in a while. it'd probably make information gathering much easier"

48,"Aug 22, 2021",hmm first baby now roleplay😂😂
48,"Aug 18, 2021",Omg I keep read Dondaemun as Doraemun (doraemon)
48,"Aug 18, 2021",Omg my man Dokja just assumed himself to be handsome. Well we all know it since the beginning.😉🤣😂 I think he looks like Sung Jingwoo for a bit. Man glad to see he ain't a rip off of him and he's actually a really good protag in his own.😂🤣🤣
48,"Aug 13, 2021",Huiwon cracks me up 😂😂 Love her 😭
48,"Aug 8, 2021",are we gonna ignore the fact that one hacker resembles L from death note ??!!

48,"May 19, 2021","And the ""spreading eachothers' notoriety and reputation"" starts from here."
48,"May 19, 2021",is it just me? or did anyone notice Sangha's smile (smirk) when she was granted the authority? I think something really shocking is going to happen here...
48,"May 19, 2021","Gee, I've never had top comment! "

48,"May 26, 2021",i... i suddenly saw sung jinwoo
48,"May 23, 2021",Is this just me (and my suspicious ass) or this expression on Sangha's face was really scary ? It reminds me of Toga (works with any crazy girl like that). As if she was waiting for it. Let me explain myself : *hum mmmh* it was like she was puting on a roleplay - the naive and kind girl - to get some power and use it in her own interest (which is probably not a good one)
48,"May 22, 2021","Sangah or whatever her name is- is either A, evil B, gonna die or C just has a major crush on our homie"
48,"Aug 11, 2022",I don’t trust sangha

48,"Jul 4, 2021",i'd love to see junghyeok's reaction to dokja acting 😌
48,"Jul 2, 2021",we just gonna skip over the fact that there's OTHER READERS here besides Dokja!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!
48,"Jul 2, 2021","Bro that other reader straight up murdered the one standing up to him, oof. Poor guy. ...but yeah, Kim Dokja straight up stole Joonghyuk Yu's identity lol, though it's not like he's using it right now lkdjsfksla- There's one prophet, so there should be 12 of them if they didn't all die."

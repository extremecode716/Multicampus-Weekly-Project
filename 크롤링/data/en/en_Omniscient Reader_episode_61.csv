Episode,Date,Review
61,"Jul 14, 2021","Man not only did Dokja use him to get out of the current fight, he also used him to fight the other stations???!! King moves only‚Ä¶"
61,"Jul 14, 2021","Ooh I love how they portrayed everything in this episode! It was so pretty when the sky turned into the galaxy/stars! It was also cool to see how a constellation would possess an incarnation like that. This makes me so excited to see future events! Oh also, MVP Sangah üòç ‚ö†Ô∏è Edit: future character spoiled in replies"
61,"Jul 14, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" was amazed that the incarnation ""KDJ"" could handle a constellation's possession for such duration.] [5 coins have been sponsored. ]"
61,"Jul 14, 2021",Dokja signed a contract that made it so he couldn't have any constellation. But this new item just made it so he could talk to any constellation. And a lot of constellations are watching him. This kinda shows how much Dokja really thought this through
61,"Jul 14, 2021","Man i can‚Äôt understand the people who stopped reading this webtoon, pfff renouncers "
61,"Jul 14, 2021",when you take your roleplays way too seriously
61,"Jul 14, 2021","Man, don't you just hate when you're recreating a historical battle and the enemy raises the dead? Feels bad, man."
61,"Jul 14, 2021",ok but dokja's possessed eyes p-pretty üò≥üëâüëà
61,"Jul 14, 2021",PowerPoint the real MVP here.
61,"Jul 14, 2021",dokja really said ‚Äúarise‚Äù
61,"Jul 14, 2021","Dokja is basically just a gamer breaking the game before the patch notes hit, I wonder how his character and approach will change once he is at a point in the story where his current future has strayed too far from the original story"
61,"Jul 17, 2021","this entire chapter gave me CHILLS. I ESPECIALLY loved when he said ""Lend me your voice... so that i may unleash my anguish"" i LOVE this series so much"
61,"Aug 18, 2021","Sangah is the MVP here, without her the General won't help Dokja winning this battle."
61,"Jul 14, 2021","And thus, Dokja checkmated the board."
61,"Jul 14, 2021",the panel where Dokja gets possessed by the general is amazing. sleepy-C *really* knows how to do his job
61,"Jul 14, 2021",*Sangah used Talk-No-Jutsu* *It was highly effective*
61,"Jul 14, 2021",*now researching korean history
61,"Aug 18, 2021",Noticed the translators changed ‚ÄúImmortal King‚Äù to ‚ÄúKing of No Killing‚Äù per commenters‚Äô request! Thank you translators for all of your hard work!
61,"Jul 14, 2021",Can I just say this webtoon is amazing! I really want them to adapt this into an anime it would be soooooo good
61,"Jul 14, 2021",Little history lesson / reenactment before going back to being a total badass
61,"Aug 18, 2021","Appreciation comment for Sangah. She doesn't get a lot of fight scenes, but she's smart and she gets people to listen to her. Dokja better keep her around! "
61,"Aug 14, 2021",I still can't get over this kid running with Mjolnir lol
61,"Jul 14, 2021",Endlessly scrolling for Lazy Broke Weeb‚Äôs comments‚Ä¶.ü•∫
61,"Jul 14, 2021",chapter 46 of waiting for yoo sangah in a black chinese dress and garter belt
61,"Aug 18, 2021","wait... anyone noticed that the Webtoon translators read the comments and Dokja's skill is changed to King of No Killing now!!!! it got changed in the previous chapters as well, this is so amazing omg"
61,"Jul 14, 2021",If only Gyebaek said a dirty joke before his last breath ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I would have told him to get his Head out of the gutter üòÇü§≠
61,"Jul 14, 2021",[The Constellation BadWolf has been immersed into historical context & has enjoyed this dramatization] [5 coins have been sponsored]
61,"Jul 14, 2021","They really pulled a move from Solo Leveling, I could almost hear Dojka say ‚ÄúArise‚Äù"
61,"Jul 14, 2021",happy 60th episode
61,"Jul 14, 2021","The constellation only talks through him right? Because if they just merged, does that constellation have info on twsa?"
61,"Aug 18, 2021","Sangah is really helpful as a history knowledger (it's really a thing with all that historic constelations) and charismatic person, she is upset and worring for nothing as not everything is about battles.
I m very happy because the author sheers for his country history and make all seens so powerful, all the pop media is so euro-north american centered that stories well produced like this are very important."
61,"Jul 16, 2021",The money I would pay to see this webcomic become an anime... üò≠ 
61,"Aug 18, 2021",Am I the only one who completely switched the voice and accent of Dokja's dialogues in their head after the constellation possessed him? 
61,"Aug 18, 2021","Just a heads up, I'm disliking every ""This is similar to Solo Leveling."" comments cos the fact that you read this far BUT still failing to comprehend the astronomical differences of the two series makes it apparent that (either intentional or not) youre just pulling the legs of the readers of this series atp. I also urge everyone to do the same. To hopefully stop the highkey carelessness of those kind of people."
61,"Aug 11, 2021","sangah, saving everyone with the power of presentations"
61,"Jul 14, 2021","As a DnD GM once said: ""Roll a Nat 20"""
61,"Jul 14, 2021","""Attack.""how powerful is that??!!
 btw,, Lazy Broke Weeb,,  where you at?üòÜüòÜ"
61,"Aug 18, 2021","gotta say.. I looooove this chapter/arc.. Sangah gets to shine with her historical knowledge and being able to convince the constellation of the king to step in.. and to witness, in a way, history. Sounds weird, but I like that the king had one of his undead men to execute Gyebaek. I dunno.. maybe I just think the skeleton looked way awesome o-o and makes it so eerie to watch.. anyways.. I'd honestly be happy even if just this chapter was animated o-o"
61,"Aug 18, 2021","Incredible use of Asian history. Brilliant. Coolest graphic serialization since Death Note. I love Tower of God, too, but OR is at least that good. Why isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúlikes‚Äù tally maxed out?"
61,"Aug 18, 2021","Ah, I've seen too much fanarts of this story that that one single panel of a star glimmering in it and they look up to the sky to talk to the constellation are enough to make me go emo üòÇ come to think of it, the pseudo-direct interaction between an incarnation and a constellation is rather melancholic, right. they look up to the sky and talk, knowing there are someone up there who is also looking at them. that's why simple line of [the constellation ""xxx"" is looking at you] is so damn deep"
61,"Aug 18, 2021",This was insane!!!! The artist really is amazing because there‚Äôs not many who can direct a scene so well. This was a phenomenal chapter 
61,"Aug 18, 2021",Ok but Dokja with blue eyes tho <3
61,"Aug 19, 2021","This has got to be the best comic I've read on webtoon!!! I'm truly addicted and there are a lot of addicting stories on here. The writer of this webtoon seriously worked their a**es off. I'm getting a history lesson as well, my God. IDK whether this is real history but I'm convinced just by how much depth the writer puts in. "
61,"Aug 18, 2021",Classic Dokja move. A plan inside a plan inside a plan
61,"Aug 18, 2021",Sangah is too OP lmao. I'm always jealous of people who can do presentations properly ugh. Also her historical knowledge and the ability to recall it ‚ú®‚ú®
61,"Aug 18, 2021",For once I feel sorry for the constellations ... knowing they too were once mortals who have endured pain and suffering ...
61,"Aug 18, 2021","Yo, the undead army thing coming up was pretty cool. Go Dokja. And kudos to Sangah (sorry if I misspelled it) for convincing the Constellation too. Dokja couldn't have done it without her."
61,"Aug 18, 2021",Sangah is queen‚ú®‚ú®üëëüëë

61,"Aug 18, 2021","The sky suddenly showing the stars was breathtaking. If this got animated, oh my god..."
61,"Aug 18, 2021","Not going to lie. Dokja being ""possessed"" was really cool and if they make an anime  of this I have high hopes for this scene."
61,"Aug 18, 2021",His moves are so calculated.. Sangah deserves a praise here eshh
61,"Aug 18, 2021",I always love when authors bounce off of history for their stories and I know nearly nothing about history around Asia so this has been a lot of fun.
61,"Aug 18, 2021",I‚Äôm just now realizing that dokja hasn‚Äôt directly killed anyone this far (could be wrong though üòÖ)
61,"Aug 18, 2021","Sangah uses ""Talk no Jutsu"", it's super effective!"
61,"Aug 19, 2021",Happy Anniversary to the English webtoon version of Omniscient Reader!
61,"Aug 18, 2021",We ought to appreciate Dokja Kim's intelligence and beauty more as a community
61,"Aug 18, 2021","Dokja is going to become a constellation at the end of this series, I think. Just a fan theory, but I truly think that that is the direction we‚Äôre going towards. "
61,"Jul 14, 2021",I would insert a decapitation joke‚Ä¶..but I don‚Äôt want there to be any Spoilers A HEADü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
61,"Aug 22, 2021","Sangah finally getting the spotlight she deserves, yaaassss"
61,"Aug 19, 2021",Stage Transformation = Dramatization? Aight no problems there. Also Sangah üíïüíï
61,"Aug 18, 2021",I sometimes forget how handsome Dokja is... also can someone remind me what his oath was?
61,"Aug 18, 2021",Dokja: so we have two optionsüòä one is 100% chance of minor sacrifice the other is a toss up for major or none. What do you choose? Min Jiwon: cool can I go with the fir‚ÄîDokja: jk there‚Äôs no choice we‚Äôre doing the second. 
61,"Aug 18, 2021",Sangah shows us that every person counts. Even the smallest help. You go girl!

61,"Aug 18, 2021",they should show history using comics like this so kids get more interested in learning history 
61,"Aug 19, 2021",this comic/book not only has amazing art but you get history lessons too ü§© I was enlightened while reading ü§£
61,"Aug 19, 2021",ok but why is know one talking about sang ha speech 
61,"Aug 19, 2021",Can we just appreciate how wonderful this webcomic is like üòîüòîüòîüòîüòî
61,"Aug 18, 2021",Idk about you guys but that was unexpectedly heart warming‚Ä¶like it was very satisfying to read but at the same time I kinda do feel bad they he never got a chance to fight him personally but oh well‚Ä¶it is what it is 
61,"Aug 18, 2021","Wow thanks Webtoon for changing 'Immortal king' to 'king of no killing' üíïtho there's some kind of typo in Dokja's sword name, it is 'Unbreakable Faith' up to the last chapter and in this chapter it change to 'unbreakable trust's???"
61,"Aug 18, 2021",Sangah MVP
61,"Aug 18, 2021",This episode. This. Damn. Episode. üíØ
61,"Aug 18, 2021","thank you so much author for not leaving us on a cliffhanger before the fight, i loved to learn more about Korean history through this amazing episode!"
61,"Aug 18, 2021",Why isn‚Äôt this an anime yet?
61,"Aug 18, 2021",Props to Sangah for keeping constellation dude with them. Dokja getting possessed was pretty lit. No doubt this'll all make the lady like Dokja even more...

61,"Aug 18, 2021","I like that they fixed the translation and now it‚Äôs King of no Killing, but did they have to change Unbreakable Faith to Unbreakable Trust?"
61,"Aug 18, 2021","Wait a minute, di-did they changed Immortal King to King of No Killing? Yippeeee"
61,"Aug 18, 2021","This has to be my new favorite episode! I love the bit of history in this chapter! It was new to me. I also love how the author gives the other characters the spotlight every now and then. Also, the skeletons looked so cool!"
61,"Aug 18, 2021",This is one of the only webtoons that manages to constantly leave me in awe with every episode... The story and art are just fantastic!
61,"Aug 18, 2021",[The Broken Delusional god] is upset that you didn't call me!
61,"Aug 18, 2021",This episode gave me chills! Even more so than some of the more ‚Äúepic‚Äù or dramatic fights in the series so far. ‚ÄúLend me your voice that I may unwind my anguish‚Äù is just top-tier dialogue
61,"Aug 23, 2021",Can we just talk about how much research the author must have done to write this webtoon? Literally incredible. And the world building aspect is amazing too
61,"Aug 22, 2021",noooooo I caught up after binging this series for a while üò© now I have to wait?? ü§ß tis a shame
61,"Aug 21, 2021",That moment when you've binged this webtoon for two days and you finally hit your first pay wall 
61,"Aug 21, 2021","[The Constellation, ""The Lonely Siren,"" sings a song of passing for the fallen warriors of Hwangsanbeol to guide them safely into the afterlife.]"
61,"Aug 19, 2021",This whole WEBTOON is badass and keeps getting better 
61,"Aug 19, 2021",Sangah and her historical background always coming through in the clutch 
61,"Aug 19, 2021",the way that the webtoon portrays Korea's history is really refreshing and interesting to see!!
61,"Aug 19, 2021","I cannot explain how much I LOVE this chapter- from the language, to the constellations in the background, to the eerily beautiful way the skeleton warriors arose- I really cannot imagine a historical battle being redone in any more of a breathtaking way!!! üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ"
61,"Aug 19, 2021","this chapter read like a movie. I was in shock. the visuals, the immersion, the dialogue.  this has been one of the better chapters. (and that's saying a lot, because so far no chapter has been wasted in this webtoon). I'm so glad to be reading this."
61,"Aug 18, 2021",THIS IS...... THIS WEBTOON DESERVES TO BE MADE INTO AN ANIME.... I WOULD CRY HAPPY TEARS. IT'S SOO GOOD

61,"Aug 18, 2021",Sangah‚Äôs an mvp though.
61,"Aug 18, 2021","None of the top comments even mentioned Dokja with blue eyes like SIR?!? Mans was good looking before but goddamnüò≠‚ù§(I have a weakness for blue eyes with dark hair, or red eyes with dark hair but obviously only one of those is actually realistic for our world)"
61,"Aug 18, 2021","For anyone confused, like me, by the historical context of the constellations, Queen Jinseong was the last Queen of Unified Silla in the late 800‚Äôs before it split in the Later Three Kingdom Period. Yusin Kim, Gyebaek, Gwanchang, and the battle of Hwangsanbeol are from the Three Kingdom Period in the mid-600‚Äôs nearly 250 years earlier that lead to the formation of Unified Silla. So the author is mixing things up a bit. I assume Korean readers aren‚Äôt confused by this, but I had to look it up üòÖ"
61,"Aug 18, 2021",That was an interesting way to get me to read Korean history
61,"Aug 18, 2021","Don't forget to like every week! The more we like, the more constellations will watch Dokja's stream and gift him coins!"

61,"Aug 24, 2021","I'm so used to read it as [stage transformation] in the novel that reading it as [Dramatization] feels kinda odd xDBut I'm really enjoying this webcomic adaptation, I can't wait to see how they draw certain parts of the novel!!! 8(>~<)8"

61,"Aug 19, 2021",Dokja looks extra handsome this chapter 
61,"Aug 19, 2021",Dokja just pulled a Yamamoto from Bleach's blood war arc. my lord this chapter portrays it so well. 
61,"Aug 19, 2021",Great to see Sangah getting to shine! 
61,"Aug 19, 2021","Sleepy-C, thank you for this beautiful art üåå I also love how we are kept surprised: at first, it looks like some apocalyptic/video game-like story, but there are many references to Korean history and recreations of battles!"
61,"Aug 18, 2021","after watching the k-drama ""Hwarang"", this was really more fun (same uniforms and hairstyles) if not i wouldn't understand ü§ó"

61,"Aug 18, 2021",sir...... where do you get the inspiration to write this amazing book... I'm literally feeling lucky that i can read this story...

61,"Aug 18, 2021",Some of the names switched around like [Unbroken Trust] got me messed up also ‚ÄúPlausibility‚Äù instead of Probability too. I do love the webtoon version tho it‚Äôs amazing seeing previously read scenes visualized so kudos to the artist and TL and anyone else who works on this
61,"Aug 18, 2021","I just realized something-at this point, the main character is essentially a constellation. He has the 3rd person thing, can take over people's bodies, can distribute items and grow people's skills, can't die, can be affected by immersion, not bound to any constellation, isnt a character but rather a part of the world. He's kinda a living constellation."
61,"Aug 18, 2021",But why change scene transformation to dramatization? I like the former so much more
61,"Aug 15, 2021","I like how we get a history lesson even if it isnt real, lol, PLEASE AUTHOR! make this into an animation series, I love this story so so so much it's so amazing!!!!! "
61,"Aug 14, 2021","Damn, sometimes Dokja is scary smart. For him to use unrelated to his channel contelations to bend the rules of the historical battle and to even kill another constellation. Bravo my man, bravo"
61,"Aug 13, 2021",I love that the traits of all the characters get to shine while we also get to learn more about the world this all takes place in. This webtoon is so incredible and its creator even more so for making it.
61,"Aug 12, 2021",Dokja eye's is beautiful in here
61,"Aug 9, 2021",Did anyone else give the king that possessed dokja an awesome voice in their head or just me?
61,"Jul 15, 2021","can we pls just appreciate the art of this webcomiclike
take a moment and sing a prayer or smth"
61,"Sep 19, 2021","that was... epic.... i dont even know that much ab korean history but wow, so many emotions... i kinda feel bad now for gyebaek :( seems like he rly wanted that rivalry thing w yusin but he wouldnt let him get close üò¢ im such a sucker for stories like that"

61,"Aug 19, 2021",Ah yes the good ole GAMERS‚Ä¶ASSEMBLE never fails
61,"Aug 19, 2021","I understand that the main was afraid of braking his oath but that is a good question. Just the same as ordering someone else to kill for you is indirectly killing, would having a constellation possessing your body kill with your hands be the same?"
61,"Aug 19, 2021",yes let's get the chungmuro flag with the skeleton army!!
61,"Aug 19, 2021","Unrelated but every time I read ""Silla & Hwarangs"" it makes me remember the K-drama 'Hwarang' lol. Anyway, I'm really amazed by how this is beautifully drawn & written. I really do love the art style here & of course the story itself. ^^"
61,"Aug 19, 2021","How many other non-Korean people also get lost in toons when the author writes about or uses Korean history in their works? It's all good though, I tried my best to follow along. Also, I'm from Texas, where y'all from?"

61,"Aug 18, 2021","In this battle, one of the ‚Äúcaptains ‚Äú of hwarang fought geybaek (they are probably arch nemesis), the captain killed geybak during the battle - not directly- . In the scenarios when a constellation is in-tune with his incarnation, and is also presented with a story about him( a battle he fought) with another constellation that will trigger the (dramatization) which wraps the reality of the place to that same battle they fought. And the story will lean towards the winner in the battle."
61,"Aug 18, 2021",This ep was so epic
61,"Aug 18, 2021",This episode gave me Thor ragnarock vibes. Anyone else? 
61,"Aug 18, 2021",Dokja really became Wei Wuxian with the skeletons huh
61,"Aug 18, 2021","Everyone else in that fight were thinking the same ""is that even legal"" then proceeds to get impaled."
61,"Aug 18, 2021",Dokja you're having to many bad a$$ anime moments to the point its getting illegal-

They were soldiers who fought to prevent the fall of their kingdom. Now they were fighting for a fallen kingdom.‚Äù"

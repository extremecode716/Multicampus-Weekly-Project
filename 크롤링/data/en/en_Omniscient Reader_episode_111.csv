111,"Jun 29, 2022",I am currently re-reading the novel. I am on chapter 469‚Ä¶ seeing all of this play out again hurts me physically. The depression that has bit me on the ass from seeing how happy they are.

111,"Aug 8, 2022","Being honest, this is one of the best series I've seen. The episodes are long and more detailed then other series. Amazing job creator! It also amazes me that the creator can get these extremely long episodes out weekly. "
111,"Aug 4, 2022",sangah casually reading dokjas mind and he highkey ain't paying attention 
111,"Aug 3, 2022",this makes me feel soft
111,"Aug 3, 2022","Oh, Dyonisus, you party boy, you."
111,"Aug 3, 2022","For those wondering why these constellations - gods - are communicating with humans in a very vague way (no direct verbal communication, no revealing of their true name or form) is because the gap between the 'class' is too great between the two that humans cannot withstand the impact of seeing and hearing gods on the flesh(?).  That is why they appear through online-chat(?), DM(?), or at best, by taking the form (avatar) that symbolize them."

Episode,Date,Review
72,"Sep 29, 2021","I find it really cool how the fourth wall ability works, usually in things like these where they have an ability like that it just says ""it makes them calm"" with no explanation as to why, like in The Gamer, at least this one explains why. Edit: Thx for my first top comment, also I somehow managed to spell like wrong so I fixed that"
72,"Sep 29, 2021",School Bully: ‚ÄúI remember you‚Äù. Dokja: Spending money with malicious intent
72,"Sep 29, 2021","Yknow, I *was* gonna try to quit fastpass for a bit. Screw you Dokja and your amazing character arc. "
72,"Sep 29, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" was amused to know the limitations of the so called 4th wall and is now curious how far can it protect the incarnation ""kdj"".][5 coins have been sponsored. ]"
72,"Sep 29, 2021",I would be down to overcome trauma within an hour and also be rewarded for it
72,"Sep 29, 2021",Side note but the constellation name ‚Äúthe one who overcame the trials a little to late‚Äù is so saddening. 
72,"Sep 29, 2021",If this aint retail therapy idk what is
72,"Sep 29, 2021","""I cant have the 4th wall shake everytime I come accross someone... who traumatize me!"" gurl ur telling me theres more than one? ü§®"
72,"Sep 29, 2021","Friendly reminder that this guy is an unreliable narrator. ""Little"" traumatised. Really."
72,"Sep 29, 2021","never gonna give you up!(fastpass), never gonna let you down(my phone).Never gonna run around and desert you(webtoon)"
72,"Sep 29, 2021",paying to win so you can beat ur bully into submission; the therapy they dont tell you
72,"Sep 29, 2021","the pain isn't real, the fear isn't real, the decisions aren't real- fourth wall making the world fiction so all the pressure from problems stopping him from acting is alleviated. keeps him calm, keeps the pain down, allows him to act decisively without hesitation... so why does the Fourth Wall ability keep him from seeing his stats... and keep other people from seeing his stats?"
72,"Sep 29, 2021",The fourth wall is such a cool but also ‚Ä¶sad?? Skill. Like yeah he can remain calm thanks to it but not being able to value someone as a person and just as a character is kind of harsh. God I love this story so much i can‚Äôt wait to see what happens in the future 
72,"Sep 29, 2021",Dokja's therapy is racking quite the bill. 
72,"Sep 29, 2021","It's really interesting to see how Dokja understands his trauma and knows that its something that hurts him and won't go away that easily, but still being able to fight against it, trying to overcome it feels really genuine, a head on approach but still a great step to moving on. It's just really great written, it makes you sympathize more with the characters and we also get a greater understanding of why they are like that, its just so good."
72,"Sep 29, 2021",Lmaoooo did she just say ‚Äúbig sis‚Äù he just got family zonedüòÇü§´ smh no harem for her
72,"Nov 3, 2021","Idk, it‚Äôs kind of heartbreaking to learn that in order for Dokja to continue to be semi-OP he has to perceive the world as false. It‚Äôs all well and good when it‚Äôs nameless monsters and crazy magic but this means no matter what happens it will seem like it‚Äôs not real to him. His bonds with his friends, the lives he saves, people he meets that he actually cares about. None of it‚Äôs real to him. "
72,"Nov 3, 2021","Now I get why the renouncers become characters after they don't know thr future anymore: because they stop perceiving the world as fictitious. Since they don't have something that protects them like that, when they don't know what comes next, it stops being a novel and becomes their reality."
72,"Sep 29, 2021","I will never stop saying this, ""Fuck Bullying!"""
72,"Sep 29, 2021","dang. props to the author,  4th wall is a REALLY cool ability. "
72,"Sep 29, 2021",„ÄåThe Constellation with a Trident draws the border between land and sea„ÄçKnows Dokja will Overcome his PTSD from this annoying Furrbully and pull through with all his might! „ÄåFive coins awarded 5„Äçto all those who are still reading with us even nowÔºÅÔºÅYou guys are the real deal!ÔºàÔºæœâÔºæÔºâ
72,"Sep 29, 2021",I am honestly surprised that a lot of Web comics don‚Äôt get an animated adaptation. I understand maybe some authors don‚Äôt want one but I would rather one of these then the BS they decided to animate. Way too much talent out here for more not to get animated. Unless WEBTOONs stops them from doing so.  But  I would love to see this animated on whatever platform.
72,"Oct 5, 2021","If Dokja kills Minu, I feel like that shouldn't count as a mark against his King of No Killing attribute since Minu has renounced his humanity."
72,"Sep 29, 2021",It‚Äôs really cool how the ‚Äúfourth wall‚Äù is connected to his psyche and mental trauma very inspirational 
72,"Sep 29, 2021","damn, imagine getting paid for killing the guy who bullied you. Some years ago I would have done that shit for a bag of chips"
72,"Nov 3, 2021","I love how realistic the Fourth Wall ability makes the story. There‚Äôs no way someone could be that decisive and confident, even if they know what‚Äôs going to happen. Life is scary even if you know what‚Äôs to come- ESPECIALLY if you know what‚Äôs to come. So the Fourth Wall ability shaking gives us insight into Dokja‚Äôs true form, which is just an ordinary, scared bookworm. The only reason we see him as a sassy, smart badass is cuz of his ability. But I like how this is debunking his unnatural courage"
72,"Sep 29, 2021",This is an interesting take on getting over your bullies by becoming financially successful and then owning them with your riches. 
72,"Sep 29, 2021",Ah yes the pay to win method
72,"Sep 29, 2021",Holy moly I love that even in the panel where the bounty shows up you can kind of see the vulnerability in Dokja‚Äôs face! His eyes look different but even then he is still quick to try and overcome it when accepting the bounty!!!! I love this!!!
72,"Oct 1, 2021","I cant believe it's been 71 weeks, since this started, I look forward to this every Wednesday. and I thank everyone here in the comments who make this even better."
72,"Nov 3, 2021","ooooh I like the explanation of the Fourth Wall ability‚Äî also I think this is the first time we've seen Dokja look exhausted like this (we've seen him beat up, but not so... tired looking) and tbh... I like it. I love his badassery throughout all this, and how he stays calm and collected and unscathed so much of the time with his brilliant plans and manipulation and everything, but his weakness in this ep makes him seem a little more human and relatable and therefore more special, to me at least"
72,"Sep 29, 2021","I guess the nature of Fourth Wall is related to why Dokja can't view his Attributes Window. If you have to view the world as fiction, you can't be a character with attributes. Not to mention, this could also explain why he couldn't see Sangah, Myungoh, and Gilyoung's Attributes Window. Edit: Not Huiwon coz he does see her list"
72,"Nov 3, 2021",It's great how realistically this story portrays past trauma impacting people years later. Even though the method to overcome that trauma might not be realistic XD But doesn't everybody wish they could at least punch their old bullies once?
72,"Sep 29, 2021",I love a good revenge plot 
72,"Nov 3, 2021",congrats!!! your special skill is dissociation!!!! 
72,"Oct 28, 2021",It‚Äôs funny that Dokja used TWSA as an escape when he was 17 and now I‚Äôm 17 and this is my escape too :(
72,"Nov 3, 2021","If that is how it works, then it would also explain how he was so easily able to acclimate to it all. The pragmatism, willingness to let others die without feeling any remorse, the ability to scheme, etc. Quite brilliant really."
72,"Nov 10, 2021","I like how the author is calling it what it is: trauma. We often don't hear that word casually throw around in fantasy or action genres as much as we should. But in reality, having a high school bully is traumatic, a lot of what these characters have been through and are going through is in fact traumatic. "
72,"Nov 3, 2021",the bounty scenario is hilarious... therapy speedrun
72,"Nov 3, 2021","That is an interesting fatal flaw to his ability. Since he can view the world in terms of audience (himself, the non-characters, and various unknown others) and characters then its not just trauma he has to watch out for. Anything that could potentially be a fourth wall break in a story might do damage to his ability. He could potentially even destroy it himself simply because he starts to think of himself as a character in a novel"
72,"Sep 29, 2021",I'm stuck in the fast pass loop. I'm not that upset about it. My bank account however....
72,"Nov 4, 2021","That‚Äôs actually pretty dark. Kim Dokja doesn‚Äôt see these people as humans but CHARACTERS, and that what keeps him calm. The Fourth Wall might me a good skill but it‚Äôs depressing. "
72,"Oct 1, 2021",‚ÄúEvery time I come across someone who‚Äôs traumatized me‚Äù dude how often did someone traumatize you that you would think that
72,"Nov 4, 2021","Some of these translation choices are kinda disappointing, lol. I liked the original when Dokja referred to it as ""just some normal trauma"" and Han Sooyoung is like ""there's no such thing as 'normal' trauma"". But I'm loving their dynamic anyway. Han is a fun character."
72,"Nov 4, 2021","Out of all of the ‚Äúvideo game‚Äù type webtoons I‚Äôve been reading this is by far the best. I have been thoroughly enjoying the little plot twists, the unknown rivalry‚Äôs and the unexpected companionship. ‚ÄúOh you plagiarized? Fight with me‚Ä¶ prove to me you‚Äôre more than the worthless husk that grovels before me.‚Äù"
72,"Sep 30, 2021",‚ÄúA little trauma‚Äù he said‚Ä¶.ok 
72,"Sep 29, 2021",Who needs the power of friendship when you have coins
72,"Nov 3, 2021",so in a way the fourth wall can be a blessing and a curse since it prevents him from ever making meaningful relationships with other people who he can only perceive as characters 
72,"Sep 29, 2021",the plagirist isnt as Bad as a person as i thought
72,"Nov 3, 2021","I just wanted to remind y'all that Suyeong feels what her Avatars feel. So, uhm, yeah."
72,"Nov 3, 2021",‚Ä¶Dokja always looks especially handsome in awesome fight scenes like this üíï ‚Ä¶aight I‚Äôll see myself out lol I do wonder what would happen if the fourth wall deactivates/breaks down
72,"Nov 3, 2021",[An unknown constellation pulls out a ‚ÄúKDJ‚Äù banner and says to beat the living daylights out of the badly painted sock puppet]
72,"Oct 14, 2021",The Fourth Wall begins to reveal itself. This skill is so great and I'm loving how it adds to Dokja's character. 
72,"Sep 29, 2021","Love that we‚Äôre getting more character development for Dokja right now, sounds like the more he understands himself, the more he‚Äôll unlock with the fourth wall"
72,"Sep 29, 2021","I feel kind of dumb because I use the expression ""fourth wall"" all the time because I'm a student in a theatre, and I didn't think of relating it to his skill even though it's litterally the same name üòêüòê."
72,"Nov 3, 2021",this is one of the cases where money CAN solve your problem
72,"Nov 3, 2021",the name of that constellation really made me go ‚òπÔ∏èü•∫
72,"Nov 3, 2021","when I read The FOURTH WALL is shaking,I literally went what?More Like I feared the fear on the screen...Never seen him so traumatized and was so relieved when he pulled himself..."
72,"Sep 29, 2021",‚ÄúMany constellations are relieved‚Äù I am one of them üòÇ
72,"Sep 29, 2021",when 4th wall is the only skill that helps dokja functioning in the apocalypse üëÅüëÑüëÅ
72,"Nov 8, 2021","Yoo Jonghyuk: Sometimes I like to place my hands on someone‚Äôs cheeks, look into their eyes... //Yoo Jonghyuk: ...And violently jerk their head until it snaps. //
Kim Dokja: ...That took an unexpected turn. //
Han Sooyoung: So did their neck. //"
72,"Sep 29, 2021","So cool, overcoming trauma is hot"
72,"Sep 29, 2021","Bruh, he just got that suit, get your filthy paws off of him. We're all rooting for you, Dokja!"
72,"Sep 29, 2021","Hi if the angst is too much for you (it is for me): The ugly furry with that flashy palette I-dare-not-mention is based on the haetae (Ìï¥ÌÉú/Áç¨Âªå, Zh: xiezhi), a goat-like mythological creature in East Asian legends. A bit sad that Song Minwoo isn't as justice-bound as his design inspiration. Anyway, his fashion taste is trash, and so is his character, so let's all thank Redice for making him even more of an irredeemable bastard and thus no sympathy will be wasted on him. Thank you ü§ó"
72,"Nov 4, 2021","I find the translations kinda weird cuz KDJ said in the original that 'it's just a normal trauma' and then HSY said 'there's no such thing as ""normal"" trauma'... BUT IT'S STILL NICEE AND COOL üíõ"
72,"Nov 4, 2021","lmfao that penalty is hilarious üòÇüòÇ ""if u fail, i will not like u anymore *pout*"" üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
72,"Nov 4, 2021",Thank goodness he's not a human with an overpowered ability with no weaknesses.
72,"Nov 4, 2021",The art on the glove closeup was cleeeean holy crap
72,"Nov 3, 2021","love seeing kdj grow as a character. everytime we learn more about him, i can't help but root for him more. he's an incredible mc and i know he's only going to get better. hes also vvvv hot but you didn't hear me say that "
72,"Nov 3, 2021",Who knew that breaking the Fourth Wall could be deadly?
72,"Nov 3, 2021",Lmao ‚Äòovercome your trauma. Time limit: 1hr‚Äô I‚Äôd be very dead haha
72,"Sep 30, 2021",When you go to fast pass to the next episode and the button isn‚Äôt there. üò≠
72,"Nov 4, 2021",well at least we now know his fourth wall ability has flaws
72,"Nov 3, 2021",Dokja spends money for speed and strength. bully be like: crap hes fast i need to get some distance. Dokja spends more money on speed be like: b***h i didn't say you could leave.
72,"Nov 3, 2021",it's really cool that we got some explanation on how the fourth wall works. the panels where he closed his eyes to take a deep breath and then open his eyes again are so captivating idk how to explain. amazing art works as always i need to applaud
72,"Sep 29, 2021",How many times have y‚Äôall read this story over? ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm at 3 times
72,"Sep 29, 2021",Can't wait to see how Dokja will end this werewolf bully's whole career! 
72,"Nov 9, 2021","""Wipe that blood off your nose, you‚Äôve done enough"" and patting her shoulder, is like the nicest way for him to say thank-you to her. It‚Äôs always fun to have the enemies working together and developing like this in stories. Great posing in this chapter as usual as well. "
72,"Nov 8, 2021",kim dokja: bitches will be like ‚Äúthis is my comfort character ü•∞‚Äù and it‚Äôll be a character who hasn‚Äôt had a day of real happiness in years // kim dokja: i‚Äôm bitches 
72,"Nov 6, 2021","so, my dad and I were talking about what a video adaptation for orv would look like, and I brought up that the camera should be in first person. AKA through Dokja's eyes. the video medium would be PERFECT for a story in the first person! we would be able to see the world through Dokja's eyes and we could see what he sees, how he views reality and people, and maybe even his thought process! (continues in reply)"
72,"Nov 5, 2021",Oh My God the fourth ability of fourth wall just solved a theory he had he thought that once the story goes past what he knows will he also turn into a character. The answer is no. Beeecause that ability will still make him perseve it as fiction and that it's a story
72,"Nov 4, 2021","it's been 11 years but he still has trauma over it, dont bullying people kids, it does have a long term effect. it may seem like nothing but it does really effect people "
72,"Nov 4, 2021",Overcome trauma in one hour? Pfft totally easy üëåüèΩ
72,"Nov 4, 2021","Hey, he didn't kill the guy.  He just disarmed him.  Heh."
72,"Nov 4, 2021",im pretty sure demon humanoids dont count for when it comes to the killing thing
72,"Nov 4, 2021",Yooo that chapter was dope! Dokja‚Äôs discovery of his ability is so badass and trying to overcome his bullying trauma is very relatable üëçüî•
72,"Nov 3, 2021",Honestly Dokja refusing to deal with the source of his trauma and distract himself instead is a pretty good summary of his character(see: TWSA)‚Äîwhich is why him punching Minwoo is so satisfying
72,"Nov 3, 2021","that was such a brilliant chapter on bullying and trauma. I just love how they portrayed it and ugh, I wanna fast pass already to see how he completes the sub scenario but alas, I am a poor broke weeb"
72,"Nov 3, 2021",School bully: Give me your lunch money!Dokja: I've already spent it... on Strength and Agility!
72,"Nov 3, 2021",Cliffhanger in the middle of a fight to overcome trauma???? Not cool
72,"Oct 4, 2021",the worst decision I've made was to fast pass this novel... I can't wait a longer than a month for the next free view...  I can't help myself... *fourth wall shakes
72,"Nov 9, 2021",I semi get frustrated that he doesn‚Äôt use the coins more often but it makes moments like these really pop 
72,"Nov 9, 2021","I forgot, Dokja looks good with his new suit "
72,"Nov 8, 2021","Lee Jihye: Dom or Sub// Dokja: I guess Domino's, sicne I don't really go to Subway that much. Don't see why you would put them in the same category though."
72,"Nov 8, 2021","[Han Sooyoung sneaks into Dokja's apartment] //Sooyoung: It's time to wake up!! [dumps ice water onto the bed] //
Dokja [in the shower] : Why are you here so early?! And how did you unlock the door? ! //
Sooyoung: Eh? Dokja? Wait, then who is ? //
Yoo Jonghyuk: Say your prayers, bitch."
72,"Nov 6, 2021","The fourth wall is so interesting though, also the fact that Dokja is being rooted for is great and overall amazing. They want to help him overcome his trauma. I believe in Dokja and I know that most of everyone else does too. WOOOoooooooooooo"
72,"Nov 5, 2021",cue me continuing to be in love with Dokja every episode 
72,"Nov 4, 2021","aaah this chapter reminds me why I 51% hate the fourth wall and 49% love it (or vice versa, depending on the situation) üôÉ anyway those gloves are really receiving all the artists priorities huh lol"
72,"Nov 3, 2021","Nice chapter, i love seeing a bit more of his own vulnerability. Also that explains why he was a badass from the start, he had a bit of  a cheat code"
72,"Nov 3, 2021","this looks so fantastic, wish this could be animated in an anime "
72,"Nov 3, 2021","As a reader I agree with the constellations being startled. But Dokja punching your problems away like this isn't how you overcome trauma. You have to speak, like when you fought Junghyeok "
72,"Nov 3, 2021","Gotta say tho, I love the werewolf design, it's striking af"
72,"Nov 3, 2021","traumas are so scary, and sometimes, it's hard to overcome. But, once you do, it will be worth it."
72,"Nov 3, 2021","Damn, there's nothing I love more than watching bullies get wrecked."
72,"Nov 3, 2021","oh my god i didnt ubderstand what the fourth wall did until this chapter even though i've read a bit of the novel, thats an insane skill dude"
72,"Nov 3, 2021","Her: let big sis help you out My brain: hold on now, this is action genre only"
72,"Nov 3, 2021",Agility lv 50 -> 100. You have now become Sonic the Hedgehog.
72,"Nov 3, 2021",Fact: Chapter 70 was more specific with the name of Song Min Woo's attribute - 'It was the 173rd one to get off after reading in parts' because unlike others readers or prophets he only read bits of the chapter till 173rd before dropping it completely
72,"Nov 3, 2021","The revelation about the Fourth Wall was shocking. It's interesting that he sees people that traumatized him as reality, not just the ""real"" characters like Sangah or Gilyeong...I hope Dokja won't meet anyone else that would trigger the Fourth Wall to shake.."
72,"Nov 3, 2021","The Gamer and this is like the comparison between shonen and seinen Manga lol, with the gamer being shonen obviously "
72,"Nov 3, 2021",Ooh learning about the fourth wall skill was super interesting.
72,"Nov 3, 2021",Bounty scenario: Overcome your trauma in one hou- Dokja: SAY NO MORE
72,"Nov 3, 2021",We all know when Dokja spends his coins sh*ts getting real
72,"Sep 29, 2021","You have activated my trap card ""Pay to win"" it allows me to ruin your day."
72,"Sep 29, 2021",Ughhhh yesssss. I love him facing his past. I'm literally shaking. This Webtoon is just üòôüëå 
72,"Sep 29, 2021",The last panel: when the kid you used to bully decides to fight back and is stronger than you thought.
72,"Nov 18, 2021","To me 4th wall is just a metaphor of dissociation or ""DID"". Like trauma made him have to escape his body and imagine to be the character of a novel in order to survive. This is way deeper than I thought. I really like that the author is giving some ""rational"" meaning to the skill. Anyway this webtoon is awesome. Don't forget to support the author !"
72,"Nov 12, 2021","a constellation who stands strong, and unwavering in the face of the opposing would love to see the bully butt kicked "
72,"Nov 9, 2021","Wow, this chapter is amazing. I can‚Äôt wait for Dokja‚Äôs next move. Also we can see a lot more of his feelings in this chapter, because we rarely see him so shaken up "
72,"Nov 8, 2021","kim dokja: my favorite position in bed? that‚Äôs a loaded question. // kim dokja: hmm, i‚Äôd have to say... // kim dokja: near the wall so i can use my phone while charging it"
72,"Nov 8, 2021",han sooyoung: huh looks like you dropped something // yoo sangah: what? // han sooyoung: your standards. would you like to get dinner
72,"Nov 8, 2021","Yoo Sangah: If I were a drink, I'd be a latte, what about you guys? // Han Sooyoung: Bleach // Kim Dokja: Sewrage // Yoo Jonghyuk: Blood // Yoo Sangah: Please calm down edgelords."
72,"Nov 8, 2021",NNNOOOOOOO I CAUGHT UP
72,"Nov 7, 2021",Oof Dokja is suffering his character development arc and I'm all in for it
72,"Nov 6, 2021",It‚Äôs amazing how the fourth wall works and how it actually makes a lot of sense. It seems so obvious now that I‚Äôve read the explanation but I couldn‚Äôt have thought of it before
72,"Nov 5, 2021",if I only had an hour to overcome my trauma I'd be real screwed
72,"Nov 5, 2021","if dokja is using the 4th wall, who are we? the fifth wall?üò∂"
72,"Nov 5, 2021",so it's paid to win huh
72,"Nov 4, 2021",Dokja has become a Furry Exterminator xd
72,"Nov 4, 2021",hello. what do you mean every time you come across someone who traumatized you? minu song is not the only one?
72,"Nov 4, 2021",isn't it great how Dokja literally conquered his past demons? 
72,"Nov 4, 2021","Omg I love the Constellations name ‚ÄúThe One Who Overcame The Trials A Little Too Late.‚Äù That title really resonates with me and how I feel like my life has been. And the penalty for losing isn‚Äôt all that but, but this Constellation seems respectful in a very personal way. Go, the underdog. Go, the striver. Overcome that mountain. ‚ô°"
72,"Nov 3, 2021","Mans really can‚Äôt catch a break, huh? It looks like he‚Äôs suffered a lot more than one would think initially. At the start, it‚Äôs hinted that he had suffered but we‚Äôre never outright told just what kind of life he‚Äôs had up until this point. I actually really like when novels and comics do that, I feel that it adds a lot more to the story and one can better appreciate the characters‚Äô journey through out."
72,"Nov 3, 2021","Kim Dokja: When I see Jonghyuk again, I'm going to punch him. Right in his handsome face.// Han Sooyoung: Why do you keep calling him handsome? // Kim Dokja: Because that jawline don't lie, and neither do I."
72,"Nov 3, 2021",simping real bad for dokja smh...
72,"Nov 3, 2021",I sometimes forget he is 28 cuz of how hot he is
72,"Nov 3, 2021","I'm going to try to keep it to a minimum to avoid being annoying /// KDJ, trying to flirt with YJH: How is the prettiest person here doing today? //YJH, not looking up from his book: I don't know, how are you? //

HSY, from across the house: I'M DOING GREAT"
72,"Nov 3, 2021",classic bully turned furry arch.
72,"Nov 3, 2021","I'm so proud of Dokja omg. This is more than just killing a monster or completing a bounty scenario‚Äîit's overcoming his past, it's overcoming his trauma. He's doing so well üò≠"
72,"Nov 3, 2021","This fourth wall is interesting.... I wonder what will happen if he starts to view characters as reality/this world too? Anyway this Minu guy should learn his place. Also it seems like Dokja‚Äôs mother was a murderer and did a number on him in terms of trauma due to that so I‚Äôm interested to see what happens when he crosses paths with her, he won‚Äôt be able to rely on fourth wall."
72,"Nov 3, 2021",so unbroken faith has different properties ? and the werewolf design looks so cool 
72,"Nov 3, 2021",That is such a cool in world explanation/realization of the fourth wall trait!
72,"Nov 3, 2021","He be like: here, let me lend you a hand-"
72,"Nov 3, 2021","Despite being the reader of this novel, he truly is an awesome character. Wish I had some coins to sponsor."
72,"Nov 3, 2021",god i hate unreliable narrators. just ‚Äúa little traumatized‚Äù. just a little. kim dokja i swear to god. (SPOILER IN REPLY)
72,"Nov 3, 2021","Dokja has activated the skill Pay 2 Win, Shake in fear as dokja upgrades his stats drastically with coins."

72,"Sep 29, 2021","""Wipe that blood off your nose. You've done enough"". (Using Dokja's phrasing) The words used sound like they imply a form of comradery, but you have to pay attention to the punctuation. The period marks the end of a sentence, making this 2 different statements. He's not reciprocating the plagiarist's worry for the situation they're in. He's taking charge of the Humanoid Tier 6 Werewolf. Not to mention...killing this thing will give him a good bit of karma points since it's not the same species"
72,"Nov 3, 2021","""You're muscles are bulging like a monster"" *looks the exact same as always* where's the clothing damage?!"

72,"Nov 6, 2021",sung jin w- I mean dokja kim is starting to look so cool I can't wait for the next chaptr
72,"Nov 3, 2021","hmm... too simplistic a scene. No intrique, no character building, no verbal engagement, no choice, no nothing, just a puppet tagged as nemesis.
almost feels like the author got overcome with some personal grudge of his/her own, and forgot to write properly due to the emotions."

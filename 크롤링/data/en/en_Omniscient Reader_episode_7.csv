Episode,Date,Review
7,"Aug 19, 2020",that was such a 1000 IQ moment
7,"Aug 19, 2020",this is slowly reminding me of solo leveling. IT'S GREAT!!!
7,"Aug 19, 2020",‚Äúexclusive edgelord skill - grimdark awakening‚Äù is killing me
7,"Aug 19, 2020","I don‚Äôt remember the MC‚Äôs name but I definitely am liking him a lot so far. He seems like a practical guy. He isn‚Äôt saving the granny to help her, he‚Äôs doing it to stop the guy. He didn‚Äôt care to even out the odds for the others and help them survive, instead he let them scavenge to fight for it themselves. All his actions thus far almost seem cruel but very critical actions. This isn‚Äôt the typical hero-type Protagonist and Im loving it. And of course he‚Äôs not bad either, since he helped the kid"
7,"Aug 27, 2020",Bacteria is technically a living organism. Imagine having hand sanitizer and breaking the game instantly. 
7,"Aug 26, 2020","The point of the mission was to ""Prove their Worth"". Simply being violent in the name of survival is hardly any appealing trait in any apparently sentient species. I think the ""constellations"" *wanted* them to think the quest through. If they had just realized that the kid's bugs counted as ""Living Organisms"", a large amount of them would've survived. Though because they resorted to useless violence immediately, they had shown how useless they were in the grand scheme of things"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","FINALLY, A MAIN CHARACTER WHO‚ÄôS NOT INCREDIBLY STUPID."
7,"Aug 20, 2020",is this story secretly trying to tell us to read more...
7,"Sep 2, 2020","So, anyone know what happened to the girl?"
7,"Aug 28, 2020","But, he killed off a supporting character to the plot. Things are gonna get shaky... Unless he accident stepped on an egg or something? Or the grandma died at the last second "
7,"Sep 9, 2020","fun fact: like it was said at first ep dokja means reader and they literally used the word dokja as reader in korean title so its also ""omniscient dokja's viewpoint"" "
7,"Aug 21, 2020",from 'chuunibyou' and 'blackening' to 'edgelord' and 'grimdark awakening'‚Äîthough it's still way better than the translation in webtoon indonesia...
7,"Aug 19, 2020",i won't survive in this apocalypse
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Dokja*says he doesn't want to change much of the story so it doesn't become unpredictable* also Dokja: *proceeds to kill one of the main characters because he dislikes him*
7,"Aug 19, 2020",HAHAAA UNO REVERSE PICK UP THE WHOLE FREAKIN DECK 
7,"Aug 26, 2020",its gonna be one of the best webtoon ever
7,"Aug 20, 2020",Ah yes you love to see the main character already killing over 100 living creatures in the first 6 episodes
7,"Aug 28, 2020","Wait, so he could've distributed those eggs to everyone in the cabin..."
7,"Sep 9, 2020","he does know that if the white haired guy dies, the chances of the storyline changing are completely possible right? üò∂"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Guys, we have a smart mc ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
7,"Aug 20, 2020","My webtoon coin dealer be like, your back again, that‚Äôll be 30 dollars for 300 more coins "
7,"Aug 19, 2020",This is why we must study even you hate it üò©
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Dokja has the opportunity to kill the character he hates in his favourite novel and he takes it lmaooo
7,"Aug 27, 2020","""If you listen to me this once, I promise i won't ever bother you again""... Proceads to let her die."
7,"Aug 20, 2020","Dokja: OH HO, SO YOU'RE APPROACHING ME?!"
7,"Aug 23, 2020",Hate to say that but I like that kid...
7,"Aug 19, 2020",Dokja has crushed the competition so well that they exploded
7,"Sep 9, 2020",People can use sanitizers and kill bacteria... That should count I think
7,"Aug 20, 2020",So. All my coins have lead me here. What now?
7,"Aug 24, 2020",so good 5 coins so worth it 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",i cant wait for dokja‚Äôs boyfriend to show up
7,"Sep 9, 2020",WE HAVE A MC WHO WOULD GET IN THE CAR INSTEAD OF RUNNING UPSTAIRS IF THEY WERE IN A HORROR MOVIE
7,"Sep 9, 2020","He's not naive hero-type, he's not trying to save everyone. He realises he cant."
7,"Sep 2, 2020",Did he forget about the coworker girl? She dead now.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",petition for this to be turned into anime‚ù§Ô∏èü§öüèª
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I just realized that the grandma still died üò∂
7,"Sep 9, 2020",bro imagine we read this series and this is exactly how the world ends üò≥ 
7,"Aug 26, 2020","WAIT! WASN'T THE NUMBER OF SURVIVORS just 2 !?????! does it means Dojka is a new character here and coz of this change, many other things will also change?!! and what if one of the changes is that DOJKA BECOMES THE PROTAGONIST OF THE NOVEL AND NOT THE ONE HE READ IN THE NOVEL???!!!!! (technically he IS the protagonist, not in that TWSA but in webtoon 'OMNISCIENT READER')"
7,"Sep 11, 2020","To everyone who thinks this is very much like Solo Levelling I hope y‚Äôall are in for a ride because this webnovel is even crazier, aside from historical references it also has one of the best plotlines (imo) in the recent webnovels I have read."
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Outside of the obvious artstyle, MC design and the 'system'-like interface similarities can we... erm, you know, like, collectively see that this is nothing like Solo Leveling? I like SL as well so at first it was all fun and cool but at this point the lack of realization of some of yall is making me iffy. Sp we're talkin bout orv here. O R V. The novel of this is well written, endless list of important side characters, female badasses and its plot is detailed to its brim."
7,"Nov 9, 2020","For those who r saying ""he could give a bug egg to each person so everyone could survive"" well, even tho if all of them survive, yall see how useless they are. They were ganging up on an old person because a highschool kid encourage them to. Theyre going to die sooner rather than later and in surviving having too many people inside a group makes it hard to live. Like food management, etc. So with Dokja leaaving them to die i kinda agree with his choice. "
7,"Sep 10, 2020","I like how Dokja is a full adult, not some high schooler anymore.I guess many people don‚Äôt like the fact that Dokja didn‚Äôt try to save people as much as he could. I actually like that aspect of him. He‚Äôs not trying to be completely good or bad, he‚Äôs just a reasonable reader."
7,"Aug 19, 2020",I‚Äôm also an avid webnovel/webtoon reader. I‚Äôm only reading this for research for when I get transmigrated into this sh*t. It has nothing to do with the awesome story or art. üòÇ
7,"Sep 9, 2020",woah this comic can be a good anime seriesüßêüßêüßêüßêüßê
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Which student just carries around a knife in his pocket...
7,"Sep 9, 2020",this chapter is like when you're 13 and you write an au fanfic and you kill off the character you didn't like
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Man, I love those smart protagonist moments!"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",sooooo the old lady dies anyway because she didn't kill anything
7,"Aug 20, 2020","I've already blown through 15 coins, I wanna blow through 15 more "
7,"Sep 10, 2020",This is the kind of person I want to be. Hella smart hella dope. But hella nice. WHY CANT I LIVE IN ANIME/MANGA/MANWA/ETC
7,"Sep 10, 2020",Literally was thinking about this comic all of last night cuz it's so awesome then the next day it turned into the apocalypse where I live. (All the smoke California and Oregon fires West Coast USA gathered where I live making the sky so dark everyone had the lights on to see at noon)
7,"Sep 10, 2020",I thought he didn't want to change the story too much so he could still rely on the twsa manuscript. Killing one of the main characters in the early stages of the story is sure to have a huge influence in future events.
7,"Sep 10, 2020","yoo this dude is really smart, i on the other hand invested my 2700 coins on fast pass ;(("
7,"Sep 9, 2020",When you have a math online class but the comic of your fav Webnovel is just more important (I bet the teachers are gunna dislike)
7,"Sep 9, 2020","woooh dokja looked so badass when he said ""I am not gonna die.....u are"" awesome!!"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I want anime version of this webtoon later ...........!!!! I t would be the master piece ... i m sure...!! THANK YOU SHINGSHONG for this webtoon ...!!! Love U ..!!!
7,"Sep 9, 2020","""If i hesitate i will die""*kills grasshopper babies*
*activates a new skill*
*Solo level badass looking*
"
7,"Sep 12, 2020","so, did the girl from his work survive or did he just leave her to die?"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","""would you like a tutorial on coin usage"" yes yeah thank you I'm fighting a edgelord I need this right now üòë"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",‚ÄúYOU SLIMY JERK‚Äù - the slimy jerk
7,"Sep 12, 2020","ThisWEBTOON follows the light novel amazingly, I thought it was going to be a failure like the second coming of gluttony‚Äôs Manhwa that got butchered but no splendid job Webtoon"
7,"Sep 10, 2020",GUYS I AM DYIJG FROM EXCITEMENT THIS IS JUST DOPE I CANT GET THIS OUT OF MY HEAD IT'S THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST 
7,"Sep 10, 2020",So we are forgetting about the girl
7,"Sep 10, 2020","Please change ‚ÄúStamina‚Äù to ‚ÄúPhysique‚Äù. Stamina doesn‚Äôt imply resilience. That said, I‚Äôm quite happy with this adaptation üòä"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","I predict that this webtoon will have 3,149 episodesüòé"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",doesn't mean that the story will change?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",so its like work smart instead of work hard
7,"Sep 11, 2020","I would have died, I don't know my right to left"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","although i read the light novel, I'm just here to give heart and support the author. thank you for creating such a great story!"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",this why you pay attention in your biology class
7,"Sep 9, 2020",10/10 webtoon 
7,"Sep 9, 2020","People who keep saying that this is ‚ÄúSolo Leveling 2‚Äù ‚ÄúSolo Leveling copycat‚Äù or expecting that this is gonna be another SL in general will going to be Extremely Disappointed when ORV turns out to the total opposite. Jinwoo is OP, Dokja is intelligent; Jinwoo is a cold guy, Dokja is emotional and willing to sacrifice for his team; Jinwoo gets married in the end, Dokja doesn‚Äôt end up with anyone. Not to mention that this novel has a huge important female cast but there‚Äôs no romance or harem lol."
7,"Sep 9, 2020","So... is our protagonist going to take the web novel protagonist place or we'll have our protagonist and the ""protagonist""?"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","When I was reading the novel of this, I didn't expect the art to be this good. "
7,"Jul 13, 2021",Does no one feel bad for that old lady-?? >.>
7,"Feb 3, 2021",Does anyone else wonder what happened to the girl he was with.
7,"Sep 13, 2020","I‚Äôm glad you guys are finally reading this.

7,"Sep 12, 2020",Did he squish a pregnant grass hopper?
7,"Sep 11, 2020",see kids this is why you should listen in class it might potentally aid you in an apocaslyps
7,"Sep 11, 2020","This is everything I wanted, a main character that actually READS STUFF AND PAYS ATTENTION like he understands that he shouldn‚Äôt let the ‚ÄúEdge lord‚Äù (pfft best name) reach the next level because of how hard that would make it for HIM. "
7,"Sep 10, 2020","Not to be like that but i think that was a miss translation as stamina and endurance are different things and seeinf as he gets stabbes no damage taken, I'm pretty sure it is supposes to say endurance"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",this has the potential to be the greatest webtoon ever.
7,"Sep 9, 2020","swear if i hear anyone say it‚Äôs a copy or very similar to something else i‚Äôm going to be mad üò°üò°üò°, lol jk but still i find this to be a original piece and not really copied off some trend. "
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Poor baby was bullied for reading novels...üòî
7,"Sep 9, 2020","""Prove your value"" ""survival of the fittest"" this webtoon is about an acolypse but it's too relatable with real life too‚òπÔ∏è"

7,"Jun 10, 2021",I hope he gave the little boy who owns the insects one to kill 
7,"May 19, 2021",Imagine reading the last chapter of this webtoon and then all of it becomes realü§£ü§£ü§£
7,"Apr 27, 2021","""do eggs count as an organism? the answer is yes.""  female on their period sitting in the corner chilling- ""Way ahead of you m8"""
7,"Apr 27, 2021",What about the girl? Did she kill anything?

7,"Sep 14, 2020",Dokja out there practically turning the novel to a fanfic bc he does things different from the novel üòÖ

7,"Sep 9, 2020","Dude that was so awesome he used big eggs to gain a bunch of coins then used it to level up his stamina and dexterity he is a coolheaded genius
And the way he looked at the end was something on par with the best scenes like that"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Ugh I discovered this webtoon a little over a week ago... the novel is so good. I'm 5 chapters from the end of the novel and I dont want it to end üò©
7,"Sep 9, 2020",i almost forgot how bloody this story was

7,"Sep 2, 2021",This protagonist is so intelligent. Brainy af. 
7,"Jul 30, 2021","If you use hand sanitizer, wouldn't you kill millions of living organisms?"
7,"Jul 8, 2021",So people are just going to ignore the fact the the shangah lady might have died as well?
7,"Jun 17, 2021",No one hand any hand sanitizer? A small handheld bottle and no one would have had to die.
7,"May 1, 2021",He has the eggs.. Why didnt he give it away? And the granny he's defending hasnt killed anyone so she's gonna die in the end.. Im confused
7,"Apr 30, 2021",Wow I only started reading this for the free coins but now I'm actually invested
7,"Apr 27, 2021",Soo... if any of them had hand sanitizer they would've survived. Bacteria is an living organism.

7,"Oct 1, 2020","Oh, I was picturing this more as a story where he survives because he knows exactly what‚Äôs going to happen. But no, he can actually change the outcome. That makes this so much more interesting. "
7,"Sep 17, 2020",bruh this is why reading novels are important
7,"Sep 14, 2020",read the web novel its rlly good not gna spoil but super excited to see how the webtoon will turn out!!
7,"Sep 14, 2020","I wonder when ppl stop comparing this to sl? Like the plot is completely different, where is even a similarities? (don't mention art). Those who came here, bcs of sl and think that Dokja will be like Jinwoo, can stop right here and go back to sl. Dokja's power are brain, information and his strategies, and he is doing very good job in this. He will NEVER be the strongest and kicking asses here and there. There will be always someone who is stronger and have more influence. "
7,"Sep 12, 2020",I wonder who the 5 people are...

7,"Sep 10, 2020",Man I loved reading the novel. It does get a bit awkward in later parts but I can't wait to see it. I imagine it'll take a couple years to reach the end though at this pace.
7,"Sep 10, 2020","And he changed the story. More than two survived that cabin because of him, and the psychopath died."
7,"Sep 10, 2020",His IQ is dummy high of 169

7,"Sep 9, 2020",Since I've already read the novel I feel like Dokja : a reader who knows what will happen!!üòäüòä
7,"Sep 9, 2020",imagine getting rid of your least favorite character hell yeah!
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Can someone actually make a mobile game from this? Like maybe an RPG book or something like that..
7,"Sep 9, 2020","That was really smart. For a second there, I thought he was gonna kill the grandma so white hair couldn‚Äôt "
7,"Sep 9, 2020",this would be such an amazing anime omfg üò≥
7,"Sep 9, 2020","First 'Edgelord' and then 'darkgrim awakening' ... I feel like the author just broke free from mortal constraints of chuniis ... Seriously, this is chunii in a whole new level...(not that im complaining)"

7,"Sep 9, 2020",what about the girl?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",technically bacteria are also organisms so all they really needed was a bottle of hand sanitizer 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I can't believe he actually died! But if he was part of the main story how is this going to change everything he already knows? why was he so desperate to get rid of him if it risked all the knowledge he had? I wonder how far the actual story went and how it ended... what's that girl doing currently?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Is the girl who speaks Spanish alive
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I'm still waiting for my full appearance.

7,"Sep 10, 2020",Wait what happened to the chick 
7,"Sep 10, 2020",I love the art in this. I read it 10 times a week just for the art. 
7,"Sep 10, 2020",Namwoon's power reminds me of frankenstein
7,"Sep 10, 2020",Woah that turn of events (((:
7,"Sep 10, 2020",Poggers üòÆ
7,"Sep 10, 2020",OML THAT WAS SO COOL
7,"Sep 10, 2020",I gotta point out - since he had so many organisms he could have maybe saved everyone. 
7,"Sep 10, 2020",I'm geting solo leveling vibes
7,"Sep 10, 2020","Ok but, did the lady survive üóø"
7,"Sep 10, 2020",what a genius lol
7,"Sep 10, 2020",The sad part is if he felt inclined he could have given an egg to each person and they all could have survived but oh well 
7,"Sep 10, 2020",wait but if namwoon didn't survive doesnt that mean the whole plot will change and he won't know what happens anymore ?!
7,"Sep 10, 2020",Exceuse me?! what happened to the girl???
7,"Sep 10, 2020",that's was cool!!! thumps up to the authorüòäüëçüëçüôå
7,"Sep 9, 2020",And my dumbass wondered how his skill would be usefullüòÇ
7,"Sep 9, 2020",So she just left the chix to die?
7,"Sep 9, 2020","There were only 2 insects left. 2 was killed by MC, 1 probably by the kid. But, there are 5 survivors. I'm curious how the last survivor can survive without killing the insect."
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Well, what can I say? ....it's feels good to be smart"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Solo levelling vibe
7,"Sep 9, 2020",what about granny and the girl?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I felt like it was useless to protect the granny.. She died anyway didn't she ? He could have just killed the psycho later and take that time to save his friend (forgot her name)
7,"Sep 9, 2020",form now on read mangas. youll never know........
7,"Sep 9, 2020",bruh i wish i werent poor üò≠üò≠
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Soooo, mmh, did the kid survive? I mean, he was the one saving those 5 people by having bugs with him. How ungrateful it would be if he just died... "
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I have no coins but I need the next episode ahhhhhhh
7,"Sep 9, 2020",This is amazing
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Okay but...did the granny survive ü•∫

7,"Sep 9, 2020",another remarkable episode üëèüëèüëèüëè
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I might be wrong but I feel like this wont be the last of namwoon...wonder how he survives it though
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I read 150 chapters of the webnovel since I read the last episode.... no regrets üòÇ
7,"Sep 9, 2020","But if the edgelord die, isn‚Äôt that a little too easy? The story made it sound like the edgelord is a lead too, maybe a villain? So does that mean he will be one of the survivors? Oh please let the girl survive please pleaseeee üò≠"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Hello, White Hair. Goodbye, White Hair. üëã"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Ooooooo!!!! Cannot wait to find out the 5 who made it, but I'm too broke to fast pass üò≠üò≠üò≠"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Makes me wonder did he ever give any eggs or bugs to his lady friend? Or did she just die?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Damn I‚Äôm glad he went through the effort to not let the psycho survive!! 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Am not good with my left and right so I would have died if I was him xD

7,"Sep 9, 2020",what about that lady?

7,"Sep 9, 2020",edge Lord more like cringe lord
7,"Sep 9, 2020","But....I mean...ALL 2700? I would‚Äôve saved at least like ten, I mean he still would‚Äôve survived just fine if it was a bit off "

7,"Aug 27, 2020",He look so badass at the end! Rock his shit bro!
7,"Aug 27, 2020","So he spent the entire time protecting the granny from getting killed by that guy, however, she is probably going to die now anyways because she didn‚Äôt kill anything. He could have distributed those eggs out, but instead he used them all on himself. It seems like he doesn‚Äôt care about anyone else surviving, he just wanted that guy to die."
7,"Aug 27, 2020",Sad thing though is I‚Äôm out of coins (dies in mock terror)
7,"Aug 26, 2020",this webtoon can be good anime .
7,"Aug 26, 2020","oh mc is brutal, I like itüòò"

7,"Aug 19, 2020",Those eyes in ‚ÄúYou are ‚Äú are chilling and I‚Äôm here for it ‚ùÑÔ∏è
7,"Jun 3, 2021","So instead of saving another person, he used the insect to level upmaybe he could have used the eggs to save the whole cabin 
But he decided to murder a person, not like the others to survive but with the intetent for killing him 
Old Lady should be dead too, he didn't saved her"
7,"Apr 27, 2021",yo why he so hot 
7,"Oct 28, 2020",its 10 thousand times better than solo leveling though
7,"Sep 13, 2020","see you later at hell while you are building gundam, kim namwoon"
7,"Sep 10, 2020",Wait don‚Äôt bacteria count as a living organism? So if you just wash your hands or just wash anything you could get thousands of points because of how dirty things are. Idk just saying
7,"Sep 9, 2020",is any one else wondering what happened to the girl this man's was with 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",but if he changes the story too much then he will lose his advantage 
7,"Sep 9, 2020","And just like that, edgelord 2.0 was born. lmao. "
7,"Sep 15, 2022",so whos the second person to live? nobody?
7,"Aug 19, 2022",I'm admittedly annoyed that he didn't give her a bug. 
7,"Aug 17, 2022",Damn he could have saved everone and just chose not to. So he could kill a character he doesnt like
7,"Aug 6, 2022",Smert.
7,"Aug 4, 2022",10:08 59% 10:09
7,"Aug 3, 2022",so he let the girl die?
7,"Jul 21, 2022","is it bad I so badly want the mc to turn morally  gray, like I want him to get his hands dirty and actively kill people later on down the story. I just think the story is more interesting if the mc is a villian like"
7,"Jul 12, 2022",So he could have saved everyone in the cabin with those eggs....huh
7,"Jul 12, 2022","Aaah yess i see metal gear meme. Namwoon: WHY WONT YOU D√çE!?, (Dokja: STAMINA SON!!) üòé"
7,"Jun 18, 2022",some persons in cabin killed one living organism. but sangha didn't kill any how will she survive? and the scenario also has end üòü
7,"Jun 16, 2022",Did he just protagonist? 
7,"Jun 15, 2022","ngl i wanted the ""edgelord"" to live"
7,"May 30, 2022","Everything couldve been avoided if they just line the females up and kill lices on their hair lmao, but realistically we kill microscopic organisms by just moving "
7,"May 29, 2022",clearly these guys are pro life lmao
7,"May 28, 2022",why didn't he just kill the old lady? then the psycho wouldn't be able to get a kill. I get it's not an easy thing to do but she was in a lot of pain and would have died anyway because she didn't get a kill
7,"May 28, 2022",and this is why i think studying helps you survive a potential apocolypse =)
7,"May 23, 2022",he forgot to give insect to girl? she died?
7,"May 19, 2022",this reminds me of mix between the gamer and zero game
7,"May 18, 2022",What about Sangah though?
7,"May 14, 2022","""Kill one or more living organisms"" *asks to borrow hand sanitizer to kill 99.99% of germs* 
boom-shaka-laka"
7,"May 11, 2022","If the requirement to survive is to kill another living being, in theory would killing yourself in that situation revive you afterwards?"
7,"May 7, 2022",I feel like I'm being trained for an apocalypse at this point-
7,"May 7, 2022","Alright I'm taking notes here...Tip 1- when assigned to kill as many organisms as possible, consider these possibilities-
1-If only humans are permitted,kill a woman who is expecting to get a double kill.
2-kill harmless beings,as well as animals who are expecting and/or have eggs.

7,"Jan 22, 2022",So is Sangha dead?
7,"Jan 21, 2022",now the plot of the story is going to change since he changed the future of the novel. since he has these powers maybe he will overcome everything ig.

7,"Dec 28, 2021","i thought there were three bugs left? kim had already killed one, releasing the other three. so if we assume every bug was squished by separate people, that SHOULD make 4 people total having survived. however, we see kim find another bug and kill it, the eggs within included. so there should be 3 people who survived, at max. did the other two survivors accidently crush an insect egg underfoot, or did they kill another human before the revelation of exactly how far ""living organism"" extends?"

7,"Apr 26, 2021",Bro I'm surprised that Edgelord tried to kill him that entire time and didn't move to a different victim.
7,"Apr 26, 2021",He could have saved that entire cabin but he sacrificed them to level up because he hated one (1) character 
7,"Apr 26, 2021",IQ 999999
7,"Apr 26, 2021",not me imagining myself in this kind of situation...

7,"Mar 7, 2021",This is so satisfying‚Ä¶ (‚óç‚Ä¢·¥ó‚Ä¢‚óç)‚ù§uwu
7,"Mar 5, 2021",so basically he has an even more op version of the shanringan just without the extra abilities like Amaterasu and susanoo
7,"Mar 3, 2021",100 iq outplay

7,"Feb 11, 2021",dude just cheated the system. I love the RPG type leveling glitch by farming small enemies. in his case he technically killed 100s of living organisms meaning he is set for new upgrades
7,"Feb 10, 2021",Yeah you're right it kinda like have that solo leveling vibe
7,"Feb 7, 2021",increased stamina shouldn't increase your defense no matter how you look at it.

7,"Jan 19, 2021",19 yrs old Kim Namwoon has the same build and height as a 28 yrs old Kim Dokja... am I reading too much into this or does Dokja seem like he's maturing late?
7,"Jan 17, 2021",this is really addictive ....start to save money... because you'll HV to spend them later on this 
7,"Jan 16, 2021",what about that girl???

7,"Sep 9, 2020","Damn, I'm just waiting for Yoo to show himsepf"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Dude, he indirectly killed someone by killing another bug and making it unavailable for killing purposes. The suspense is *killing* me!! Also, how did he know that bug had eggs during the heat of the moment?"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Ok, Dokja made sure that Namwoon guy would die because he was such a nefarious character in the light novel, but removing him from the story so early on should cause a huge butterfly effect and change the unfolding of events! How much of a disadvantage will this bring to our hero? Also, Pregnant Bug Ex Machina, activate!!!!!"

7,"Sep 9, 2020","A split personality? Why did white hair assume that MC has split personality? I don't get it, lol? ü§®üòÇ"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I'm in love with this
7,"Sep 9, 2020",so what will happen now I mean he changed a major point in the story so is his reading ability useless?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",gore yes please
7,"Sep 9, 2020",This kinda reminds me of The Gamer webtoon
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I enjoying this fight:3
7,"Sep 9, 2020",The story reminds me of Solo Levelling
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I realize this is a serious story but I couldn't help laughing when he got his second skill and kept doing Nawoon. I have a feeling Dokja is supposed to be the protagonist of this story. I also love how his skills relate to the TWSA. I guess it gave him an edge. I loved when he leveled up and outsmarted Namjoon. I do wonder who survived though 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",5 survived?  mc and three insects who killed someone
7,"Sep 9, 2020","After reading the LN, I now have Omniscient Reader Skill level 1. You're in for a riiiiiide!!!"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Namwoon kim reminds me of kaido from disastrous life of saiki k.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I wonder if he's planning to take his spot in the story
7,"Sep 9, 2020","""Why won't you die?"" ""Nanomachine, son"""
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Okay but what about the woman from his work?? Was it Sanga? I thought he would have given her one!!
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I wish this was a real game I would so play it
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Only 2 people survived in that subway cabin in TWASA (Chapter 4), but it became 5 people... I wonder how - or if - that changes the story."
7,"Sep 9, 2020",that investment in stamina gave me major the gamer vibes like how he invests all his points for mana
7,"Sep 9, 2020",wait... is that overachievering girl alive???
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Am about to pass out from edgelord and grimdark awakening
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Hope Grandma lives and the girl
7,"Sep 9, 2020",it‚Äôs all fun and games until he finds someone whose aim is so bad that they end up hitting a totally different area than they planned on
7,"Sep 9, 2020","dang are ppl actually reading this here and paying for chapters? you can go to other places and even the translators website if u want which is already at chapter 20, updates frequently, and is free."
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Big brain boy

7,"Sep 9, 2020",Couldn‚Äôt he have. I don‚Äôt know. Given those eggs to the people on the train?
7,"Sep 9, 2020","wait, so did the chick survive?"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",So now our protagonist (the protagonist of the Webnovel we‚Äôre reading where he‚Äôs NOT the protagonist of the webnovel that he read) now has rock hard abs! XD. I kinda wished that the knife would have actually broken on his abs. That would have been both unnecessary but also awesome!
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I would have washed my hand with sanitaizar or hand wash.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",who are the 5 survivors??i wanna know so bad 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",so does that HR lady he likes survive? if so I'm really shipping them together big time.
7,"Sep 9, 2020","oof, that was wild! "

7,"Sep 9, 2020",What happened to the girl?!
7,"Sep 9, 2020",dang he smart as heck no matter what
7,"Sep 9, 2020","he's not the type to worry about friendship yet. He's more like surviving and thinking that this or that guy will be useful. He's the protagonist but at the same time a reader, he keeps insisting he's just a reader. He doesn't know that later on he will be the main character."
7,"Sep 9, 2020",wasaaap notif ganggg

7,"Sep 9, 2020",The MC has got epitaph lol. The only thing remaining is to shout KING CRIMSON

7,"Oct 9, 2020","He makes me think of Kirito from Sword Art Online. Also doesn't this change the story? If he was an important character who joins the protagonist, isn't letting him die messing things up?"

7,"Sep 25, 2020",Killing Namwoon would change the entire plot of TWSA so unless he plans on taking Namwoon‚Äôs identity he wint be able to know what hapoebs next in the story. Unless somehow Namwoon actually survived...like if the grandma died before the countdown

7,"Sep 24, 2020",Wait... if he let one of the characters of the story die... when they weren't supposed to... wouldn't that alter the story? Thus the story wouldn't be a reliable source of info for the apocalypse... right?

7,"Sep 9, 2020",I absolutely loved this episode
7,"Sep 9, 2020",badass
7,"Sep 9, 2020",One of the best moments from this story
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Got serious snk vibes from ""the strong prey on the weak""... it might be a direct quotation "
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Yes, Solo Leveling!!!"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Rose Lalond would most definitely be an Edgelord omg xD GRIMDARK!?!!
7,"Sep 9, 2020","hah, dat was a quick runüò≤üò≤üò≤"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","they called the skill ""edgelord-grimdark awakening"". lol. "
7,"Sep 9, 2020",This is an amazing webcomic!!
7,"Sep 9, 2020","im still curious , wtf happened to the girl he was with?!"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",is the girl still alive?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",He Bofuri'd üòÇ
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I wanted him to live 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",but the question is how from where did he got a raw egg 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I just read the Korean ver of this and this is much more understandable lol 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I just realized this is The Gamer webtoon but edgy (#MAKE THE GAMER AN ANIME)
7,"Sep 9, 2020",this reminds of the gamer
7,"Sep 9, 2020",The Gamer vibes for real though.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",wait.... but the grandma didn‚Äôt kill any living organism.. so she still died.... |‚Ä¢-‚Ä¢‚Äù|

7,"Sep 9, 2020",go kill a spider egg sack 
7,"Sep 9, 2020","5?? ok so stuff did change from what he originally read, right? since he's there now to change things"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","but,the granny will die in the end cuz she did not kill any organism...so,my point is, no matter what,the mc effort is pointless at the end,but that is just to satisfy their own humanity value"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",In the light novel this scene was a little harder to read because towards the end he started begging to be saved
7,"Sep 9, 2020",amazing.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Reminds me of the gamer 
7,"Sep 9, 2020",That chapter was fire üî• üî• straight fuego 
7,"Sep 9, 2020","To be honest, I kind of wanted angry guy to survive"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",So did edgelord die or not?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",EGDELORD ATTRIBUTE I CANT -
7,"Sep 9, 2020",this is basically large scale Saw games
7,"Sep 9, 2020",The white haired psycho sort of reminded me of Bakugou. If this someday has an anime adaptation I really hope they have the same voice actor.

7,"Sep 9, 2020",if the story is supposed to play out similar to the novel then wouldn't that mean this webtoon is going to be over 3000 episodes longüôÉ

7,"Sep 9, 2020","Help .... Sorry, I'm confused. üòÖ Last episode, he has killed one insect. Now, he killed another one, didn't he?"
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Well, probably lost part of its advantage to know what might happen next. According to what he said in previous chapters, only 2 people were supposed to survive in that cabin: the Edgelord and the Military Guy, who were going to join the main hero of the story. Since 5 of them survived, now he shouldn't have the advantage to know how the story will evolve till the end, because he's changed some core elements of its beginning! üòê"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",so he rescued the old Lady to let her die because she didn't  kill anything? and the boy from whom he got the insects is also done?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",the solo leveling vibes omgg im in love
7,"Sep 9, 2020",I still believe Edge Lord is still alive. edited - i shouldn't of commented this as I was spoiled twice but saves me investing my time into this
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Why did he bother killing the bug at the start if he still had another pregnant one?
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Ok but is the girl still alive??
7,"Sep 9, 2020",ah what about the female lead? does she survive?
7,"Sep 9, 2020","Now the TWSA was a 1300+ chapter long novel,and since the events we will see unfold will be based from that novel does that mean, this Webcomic is also gonna be 1000+ chapters "
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Why did Stamina increase his durabilty
7,"Sep 9, 2020",And the girl??... 
7,"Sep 9, 2020","""grimdark awakening"".......... taking a page from Andrew Hussie's book I see XD"

7,"Sep 3, 2020",wonder how the story would change now that Namwoon Kim died
7,"Aug 27, 2020",I thought he had said there was only gonna be two survivors...? Hope he doesn‚Äôt change the past too much that he doesn‚Äôt have enough plot to run with
7,"Aug 20, 2020","If i were there, I'd have used hand sanitiser to kill millions of microbes on my hands"
7,"Aug 20, 2020","Sadly, I think the girl who was studying Spanish died. :("
7,"Aug 20, 2020",couldn't he have... shared those eggs with the rest of the cabin?

7,"Sep 10, 2020",hmm so this must be the game's distant cousin
7,"Sep 10, 2020","I hope the girl survives, at least this one. But surely he already knows that the fittest would survive, so he can't be delayed by secondary characters."
7,"Sep 10, 2020",wtf episode 6?! its already chapter 21 in other weebton website...
7,"Sep 9, 2020",So he could have saved everyone on the train cart ? huuummmmm

7,"Sep 9, 2020",am I the only one who's first thought when reading this was SAO.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",He should have kept him alive
7,"Sep 9, 2020",i wanna know what he does that u have to kill him cuz i kinda liked him
7,"Sep 9, 2020",um am I missing something or did he let that chick die I mean I saw no grasshopper given to her or what
7,"Sep 9, 2020",can i get a copy of TSW or what ever? qaiting a week to read this masterpiece is killing me

7,"Sep 9, 2020",TEAM KIM DOKJA
7,"Sep 3, 2020",okayy but did his co workers that girl get to kill something? I'm already ship them tho...
7,"Aug 20, 2020",How easily he forgets about his gf! How will the explain himself to hear afterwards?!
7,"Sep 13, 2020","this is a bit of a spoiler, but MUCH later chapters will have bl undertones. just something to look forward to."
7,"Aug 19, 2020",am i the only one who's grossed out by the fact that he SQUISHED the bug in his HANDS ü§¢
7,"May 13, 2021",How he keep dat roach in his pocket the whole time???? logic is out the window so say goodbye 
7,"Nov 10, 2020",It reminds me of The Gamer and Solo leveling and its GREAT
7,"Oct 21, 2020",it's like solo leveling I Love it üëçüëçüî•
7,"Oct 18, 2020","What if he knew that he could have saved everyone!!! There was enough eggs for everyone, in the end he didn‚Äôt even save the grandma, he just killed the teen. All those peoples deaths are on him. "
7,"Sep 25, 2020","So im super lost, didnt the granny just die either way since she didnt clear the mission. In the same vain didnt he also ruin the survival of others by acting all pacifist"
7,"Sep 16, 2020",The protagonist is like a monster!!! Did he really just kill all those people by not sharing the Grasshopper‚Äòs eggs???!!!
7,"Aug 27, 2020",if eggs still in the grasshopper are considered alive then babies in the womb are too :/ getting political up in here
7,"Sep 10, 2020",Literally was thinking about this comic all of last night cuz it's so awesome then the next day it turned into the apocalypse where I live. (All the smoke California and Oregon fires West Coast USA gathered where I live making the sky so dark everyone had the lights on to see at noon)
7,"Sep 9, 2020","I'm sorry, are we going to overlook the fact he had AT LEAST 26-27 larvae with him he used on himself alone? After he killed the first bug, he could have given one to each passenger and save everyone in that cabin! Is he a ""Chaotic Good"" kind of hero? ü§î "
7,"Oct 29, 2021",if mc is protector of justice kinda guy... this is going to be a very boring one.. üòíüòí
7,"Feb 4, 2021",is this SOLO LEVELING SEASON 2????
7,"Nov 18, 2020",He could have saved everyone with those eggs :(
7,"Oct 18, 2020",I feel like dice and Gamer had a baby and made this Webtoon. I'm so here for it! üòç
7,"Sep 9, 2020",People really forgot about his new ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù what happened to her. Everyone in the train probably died including her bruh that‚Äôs sad I was shipping it too.
7,"Sep 9, 2020",Why the hell does Namwoon look and behave like a shittier version of Accelerator?!
7,"Sep 9, 2020",what about sanga???.....she is suppose to be heroine of the story .......she can't die ......
7,"Apr 29, 2021",I kinda ship Dokja with Namwoon even though I know this teenage edgelord is a psychopath. 
7,"Sep 9, 2020","""Hero"" here just murdered all but five of the people in the cabin by taking all the eggs for himself. Even the 'half of us kill the other half' plan would have had a lower body count."
7,"Sep 12, 2020",Go online and there are like 20 chaps
7,"Sep 11, 2020","damn he could have saved everyone in the car with those eggs... He's kind of a hypocrite. EDIT: You huys are totally right and im not saying he's gotta be a hero, but if thats the case then why is he judging the edge lord and everyone else for killing someone if he was just going to kill them all?! He let the grandma die too. So, hes no better than those people really....."
7,"Sep 9, 2020",why do i feel like the main charterer was in the wrong here i mean you through all the bugs killing a couple of people you didn't give any back to the child so he dead and it is kill or be killed the granny was gonna die anyway from you not giving her anything to kill and that if she doesn't kill a bug and maybe just died from a heart attack there isn't anymore hospitals so yeah good job bro.
7,"Sep 9, 2020","I'm as cold-hearted as the next sunovabitch, but did you really have to kill him for nothin?"
7,"Sep 9, 2020",that was lame he should have let the psycho live and used him for later
7,"Oct 21, 2020","Damn! I f I was there, I would have done masturbation and kill my sperms. And I'll get billion of coins üòÇ"
7,"Sep 10, 2020",the only thing thats bothering me is that the old lady will still die its not like she had anything to kill imo the main character is worse than mr edgelord like getting rid of future enemy's early on but putting on a good front he might aswell be one of those filthy righteous cultivators from reverend insanity (or the writing just isn't good weather the book was over hyped or if it gets better layer on and this is just the book in the early days)
7,"Aug 26, 2020","don't you find stupid using so many points only for stamina, I mean he could have used them better"
7,"Oct 18, 2020",dialogue is too dramatic and boring just get to the point instead of exaggerating. overall the illustrations are good
7,"Sep 23, 2020",Sooo you‚Äôre telling instead of recruiting someone with strong potential you wanted to be hero to someone who could die at any moment? This dude is stupid ._.
7,"Sep 15, 2020",Bro this is so behind compared to stuff like manga reader
7,"Sep 15, 2020","There are 22 chapters out already!! Why are there only 6 here? This is why people dont like monopolies, with out competition you can do what ever the hell you want and no one cant stop you"
7,"Sep 10, 2020",now now...killing an human is not fine but killing an insect is...what a hypocrite piece of shit he is
7,"Sep 19, 2020",boring

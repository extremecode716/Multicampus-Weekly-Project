Episode,Date,Review
20,"Oct 15, 2020",“The constellation prisoner of the golden headband is upset by the near certain cliffhanger”. I feel you on a spiritual level my guy😅. EDIT my 1st top comment EVER on a great series Too🤯 I love you guys almost as much as I love this toon
20,"Oct 15, 2020",Prisoner of the Golden Headband freakin breaking the fourth wall out here
20,"Oct 15, 2020",4th wall cliffhanger LMAO
20,"Oct 15, 2020",When characters are upset about cliffhangers in their own comic
20,"Oct 15, 2020",I'm liking Huiwon (back haired girl) even more now. She shows a very satisfying level of competence. For example she put her hair up in a bun before they went hunting. 
20,"Oct 15, 2020",Gilyeong is best boy *gives headpats*
20,"Oct 15, 2020",I think we all knew that dude was lunchmeat. Best to not get attached to anyone really
20,"Oct 15, 2020",I just love this plot and story line! In my humble opinion it’s right up there with TOG! and I hope SIU gets well soon. 
20,"Oct 15, 2020",hmm I wonder if The constellation Secretive Plotter could be the author of TWSA
20,"Oct 15, 2020","Next time of Omniscient Reader, cooking with Dokja and whats on the menu? Roasted Giant Rat!!!! Perfect for dinner with the family ;)"
20,"Oct 15, 2020","Love that Gilyoung adapted the fastest. And ah. One chapter closer to surprise m◼️◼️◼️◼️.
One of the reasons why i love orv so much is because all the ladies are well developed characters and not thrown in for romance or as an aside. "
20,"Oct 28, 2020",Who else likes Gilyeongs Interspecies Communication skill(the kiddo)? The ability to talk to bugs(and insects?). Would like to have that cuz I can just ask the spider on the wall to move somewhere instead of trying to kill it. Or like ask a cockroach or ant to leave my pizza alone in exchange for a daily supply of their type of food. And maybe even ask a butterfly what my neighbor is doing. Isnt it useful?
20,"Oct 15, 2020",Gilyeong is such a strong baby
20,"Oct 15, 2020","It's nice to finally have a protagonist that's not stupidly overpowered right at the outset. The only thing going for him right is his knowledge, and that's all he needs. 
Tower of God started off in a similar fashion, with an equal power balance among the main cast. The last 120 chapters has gotten outta control and boring with the massive power scaling though. 

I just hope this series will be able to keep its head"
20,"Oct 15, 2020",Don’t get mad when I say this might end up better then solo Leveling. This is fire I could read easily 1000 pages of this lol plus I like long ones those are my favorite where after when I think of what I read it feels like I watched a anime or something. 
20,"Oct 15, 2020","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" is proud of the incarnation Lee Gilyeong.][5 coins have been sponsored.]"
20,"Nov 4, 2020","I noticed that the little kid is always looking at the main character lols. (I don't wanna misspell their names haha)... but in that last panel, Dokja had a calm, uninterested expression when Mr. Han or whatever and the other girl were taken away. The lil kid is rlly observant"
20,"Oct 16, 2020",good to know Sun Wukong hates cliffhangers as much as me.
20,"Oct 26, 2020","The kid know something is up, you can tell by the last slide as he looks at Dokja"
20,"Nov 4, 2020",LMAO kdj you really know when to keep your mouth shut 😂 also gosh how cute is kdj patting the head of Gilyoung?? THAT'S HIS SON YALL
20,"Oct 19, 2020","I feel dumb. I just realized the 4 constellations are the 4 common readers. Abyssal Dragon = Edge lord, Golden Headband = Action reader, Demonic Judge = Justice Reader, Secretive Plotter = Narrative Reader.
Edit: Maybe DJ is actually the uh... “Fan Girl” reader with a hankering for Justice."
20,"Oct 15, 2020",The survival fee is basically like....paying taxes the only way out is to die😭
20,"Oct 16, 2020","""The prisoner of the golden headband is displeased with the certain cliffhanger."" Know what? Me too Mori, me too."
20,"Oct 15, 2020",[the constellation Father of the Rich Night is giving a heart to this episode] [Father of the Rich Night is encouraging other constellations to do so]
20,"Oct 15, 2020","The road ahead is dangerous..... we’re not just going to charge ahead ...are we, and spend all our coins on this wonderful series.... no no not at all... here is my coins take them all 😂😂😅😭"
20,"Oct 29, 2020","i have a feeling the constellation ""secretive plotter"" is actually the writer of the novel... looking at how his only reader is doing in all the scenarios"
20,"Oct 28, 2020",you know it's a cliff hanger when the characters say it's near certain for their to be one.
20,"Oct 28, 2020",I bet everyone that got their coins from the recent event spent it on this episode XD
20,"Oct 15, 2020",near certain cliffhanger.........
20,"Oct 15, 2020","Can't believe I dug myself into a 48+ day wait, but the fast pass was so tempting & well worth it :)"
20,"Nov 4, 2020","I don't know if it's just me but Dokja felt like proud dad or older bro that went ""BRO/SON SHOW THEM YOUR MOVES"" to Gilyoung and then the head pat made my heart warm"
20,"Oct 28, 2020","You know when Sangah and the business man guy got dragged into the floor, the kid and the other guy was shook while the other woman just facepalmed Then you look at Dokja with a straight face"
20,"Nov 4, 2020","I love that kid. I just want him to stick around dokja and learn from him and then they will have a bond of master and pupil, father and son.... uwu"
20,"Nov 4, 2020","I like the fact that everyone has swords, and Gilyoung (sorry if I spelled it wrong) has a skull on a stick."
20,"Nov 4, 2020",📞😃 hi Crunchyroll please make Omniscient reader a anime adaptation! 
20,"Nov 4, 2020",Can we talk about the kid at the end? Hes looking at Dokja like he knows something.
20,"Dec 19, 2020",The way he just pat pat the head of the kid every time is like awww

20,"Nov 4, 2020","lol she should've just said ""grab onto this"" then let go of the weapon. hahahahahaha "
20,"Nov 4, 2020","I love Gilyoung and Dokja's relationship, such wholesome brotherly vibes 😚"
20,"Dec 28, 2020",Why do I keep thinking secrete plotter is either the author or us (readers)? I mean that name and his personality 😂 we’ll see 
20,"Nov 9, 2020","I somehow feel the little boy is next to dokja when it comes to intelligence. All were busied by Han and Sangwa, but he kept observing Dokja for his reaction"
20,"Nov 4, 2020","ok when the Ground rat got and dragged away the glasses-guy, i was like ""haha bout time u die bish"" but then Sangha gets dragged away too, me:  😑😑😑"
20,"Nov 4, 2020"," Man I love Gilyoung Soo much, he's so mature for his age, and I love Dokja for not underestimating him and taking him under his wing❤️❤️"
20,"Mar 19, 2021",“The constellation secretive plotter nods in agreement” LMFAO same dude same that Han guy needs to leave
20,"Nov 4, 2020","The constellation, Snickering Spectator is bemused by Mr Han's misfortune. They try and gift the ground rat 200 coins."
20,"Apr 29, 2021",Anybody else feeling a spiritual connection to the Prisoner of the Golden Headband?
20,"Nov 12, 2020",The way Dokja touches Gilyeong head 🥺

20,"Mar 4, 2021","If you didn’t know, the Prisoner Of The Golden Headband is actually from a Chinese myth, Sun WuKong. A monkey. I’m really happy to see it in this webtoon. 😊 "
20,"Nov 5, 2020","To new readers, please don't check the replies of comments that are [Guessing who tls123 is]. There are a bunch of rude people who said some actual spoilers so please, do not check the replies."
20,"Nov 4, 2020",i love how dokja is like a father to gilyoung 💕💕
20,"Nov 4, 2020",Even the Gods don't like cliffhangers lmaoooo

20,"Nov 5, 2020",I reaaaallly like the kid. He’s going to be important. I feel it in my bones
20,"Nov 4, 2020",when you see top comments about breaking the fourth wall.. knowing that the fourth wall is a HUGE part of the plot and its development. Can't wait to see peoples reactions when they figure out how much of a paradoxical mindf*** this story truly is!
20,"Nov 4, 2020","Gilyoung is so cute, i live for the headpats"
20,"Nov 4, 2020",Gilyoung is a badass. The way he doesn’t want to depend on anybody and can protect himself👏 (but it’s probably because of the shock he had on the train)
20,"Nov 1, 2020","dokja: All of you have some coins left, right?
me: no"
20,"Oct 29, 2020",So this is what it's like to use fastpass... it makes me feel powerful....

20,"Oct 15, 2020",I’m addicted 😫  but it’s okay bc I’m not the only one
20,"Apr 28, 2021",Came here for the coin raid. Staying for the plot. This WEBTOON is so good!
20,"Apr 26, 2021",im glad i chose this webtoon for the free coins cuz its so good😳
20,"Apr 26, 2021",dayumm i was here just for coins but i am religiously gonna stick to this story🛐✨
20,"Apr 15, 2021",Monkey King is a pro reader 🤣🤣
20,"Mar 19, 2021",so far my favorite constellation is the secret plotter. They seem to have a good sense of humor.
20,"Mar 9, 2021",anyone else notice secretive plotter can hear his thoughts but the other constellations cant
20,"Jan 9, 2021",i love the kid he's like a mini dokja
20,"Dec 24, 2020","I just love Gilyoung so much for some reason, also in the last panel notice how he immediately looks to Dokja for instructions on the situation"
20,"Dec 13, 2020",WHY ARE THE LIKES DECREASING?!
20,"Dec 7, 2020",Did anyone realize that the kid is still looking at Dokja
20,"Nov 9, 2020","I love this series so much and re reading it every day but one thing that im so SO curious about is, who is the author? and how did their series become ‘real life’. Or is it that the author is rewriting the series again but with dokja in it, and when the series with dokja come to an end, someone else will be like dokja and it will be an endless loop (idk if this makes sense to you readers by how im explaining it but yea)"
20,"Nov 5, 2020","I like how the constellations mirror what the readers are thinking. Like ""damn really you wont answer?"" haha excellent writing so far!"
20,"Nov 4, 2020",Prisoner of the Golden Headband sounds like one hell of a rock band name 😎🎶🤘🏻
20,"Nov 4, 2020","""my biscuit."" had me rolling lol"
20,"Nov 4, 2020",HE GOT A STARTER PACK FOR FREE?! BULLSH*T
20,"Nov 4, 2020","Gilyoung is really cool but at the same time, he scares me because no way a normal child would act like that"
20,"Nov 4, 2020",The web novel keeps saying that Dokja is ugly but now WHICH PART OF HIS FACE IS UGLY???
20,"Oct 28, 2020",me and the prisoner of the golden headband checking our coins before unlocking the next chapter like *sigh. I GUESS*
20,"Oct 28, 2020","Take my money. Take it all, I will not allow any cliffhangers to stop me. I agree with the Golden Headband that a near cliffhanger is terrible. I also like how despite using coins, there are over 1000 people here before me. Also, I'm rooting for the kid all the way, PROVE TO MANKIND THAT CHILDREN ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO HELP (or end if your me) THE WORLD"
20,"Oct 15, 2020",i do not regret the cycle of coin spending I've fallen into
20,"Oct 15, 2020",That tease there. I felt it.
20,"Jul 24, 2021",hehe i like how gilyeong is so calm. i want to pat his head too ^_^
20,"May 5, 2021",I think the kid is my favorite character
20,"May 1, 2021",Is anyone else loving the relationship between Gilyeong and Dokja?
20,"Apr 28, 2021",This webtoon is meta on a whole nother level. It’s so smart about it. “The constellation is upset about the cliffhanger” and then they leave us on a cliffhanger!!
20,"Apr 27, 2021",Webtoon is satisfied with your reading 20 chapters. 5 coins have been sponsored. 
20,"Apr 21, 2021",please the kid is so savage i respect that

20,"Nov 4, 2020",I like how little boy is seeing at dojka while everyone is just running after that Mr.Han and that girl...I think that boy is more interesting than anyone else(not protoganist..he is definitely something else)😕
20,"Nov 4, 2020","I’ve been loving this series so far because 1) Obviously, the art style and action scenes, but 2) Because the MC and other characters don’t have plot armor; Dokja resolves issues, finds ways out of adversities, and fights by using his intelligence and utilizing his knowledge to his advantage. I mean, he bargained with a GOD in his favor. So, when he said that he didn’t expect all of then to make it, he was just being pragmatic."
20,"Nov 4, 2020",The constellation broke student is in agreement with the Prisoner of the Golden Headband.
20,"Nov 4, 2020","I love the relationship between Gilyeong and Dokja, their relationship looks like brothers, sometimes it looks like father and son"

20,"Nov 4, 2020","Prisoner of the Golden Headband sounds like Monkey king Sun Wukong - this makes me think that these constellations are literary figures/heroes/myths. That means the other constellations are also literary figures. it would fit the literary theme of the story, too."

So why exactly did someone choose him? What purpose did they have? What is really happening?"

20,"Nov 4, 2020","Another theory: Secretive Plotter is the author of TWSA & a bunch of other stories. They search for star streams with a world similar to Dokja’s, then writes a story about the incarnation they support. Then they inspire someone else in a different world, then write about the new protagonist into a different story. & the cycle continues...until perhaps they have reached perfection"

20,"Nov 4, 2020",i read interspecies communication as interspecies reviewer... smh
20,"Nov 4, 2020",Wait.. so Secretive Plotter can actually read Dokja’s mind? He nodded as soon as Dokja thought about creating a situation where he doesn’t have to answer the party’s question.

20,"Oct 28, 2020","Seems like secretive plotter knows that Dokja knows whats going to happen.

20,"Oct 15, 2020","while I appreciate Dokja's honesty to them I also think he has to respect that not all main characters are fish food. while he did read the story and knows all the characters he can't know all about the ones that were never mentioned, with guidance from their constellation and understanding the world a bit better they can do quite well too. besides the story has rippled quite a bit from the one you know, use it as a guide and not as a copy of reality"

20,"Oct 15, 2020",Eh the cliffhanger isn't so bad when we have 3 more days of episodes. its good that is ability makes him a little more emotionally distant otherwise I feel like he would be panicking in how to react at some of these crucial social moments (not the actual tswa ones)

20,"Jun 16, 2022","I have become convinced that Secretive plotter is a weird meta author self insert as a reader of THIS story, reacting as though they were seeing the story in person. It feels very on brand for the series."
20,"Jun 16, 2022",I FUCKING LOVE THE KID. GIMME HIM IM GONNA ADOPT HIM
20,"Jun 15, 2022",I love the father/son dynamic between Dokja and Gilyoung

20,"May 28, 2022","Okay, is the secret plotter dokja, just in some future, as a constellation and came back? Because in one of the last episodes, plotter scoffed at his decision, and dokja never read about him, and it seems that plotter is very interested in dokja? Just a theory that I came up with"

20,"Apr 16, 2022","So I just started this. I feel like Secretive Plotter might be the celestial who made the book he read? It’s definitely emphasizing his reactions and he seems to know what our MC is about. No spoilers please, Im just writing out my thoughts for other newbies 😅"
20,"Apr 15, 2022",Sun Wukong and I both don't like cliffhangers HAHAHA
20,"Apr 9, 2022","this webtoon is really great, the genre that  I always looking forward 👏💜"
20,"Apr 9, 2022", so the only person that can break his fourth wall ability is the prisoner of the golden headband lol
20,"Apr 9, 2022",Am I the only one that thinks the constellation secretive plotter is going to end up being a main antagonist because at the beginning of the story he noted that he didn’t seem that powerful yet they keep showing up in the story usually disagreeing or mad at his decisions so I think somethings gonna happen with that constellation but it’s just a hunch so I don’t really know 😅
20,"Apr 8, 2022",Master sun I feel you 🤧

20,"Nov 5, 2020",this one is moving slow story wise. you better release more of those 7 episodes in the wings or you will lose me.
20,"Nov 5, 2020","I do love the art and plot of this webtoon, however and it's an opinion, the MC is quite a Kirito (Gary Stu) and I know this genre is full of those MCs. Its a good character and at least his knowledge is explained in the fact that he was the reader, but sometimes it feels to overpowered? I mean, at the end, he used to be a simple salary man, it's like watching a playtrough and then playing the game, it'll still be tough.I just hope he will find a true challenge in his journey like a plot twist. "

37,"Jan 13, 2021","The Constellations are just as shocked as we are.  They are viewers just like us, except with more influence and less knowledge.  But now, the tides are turned.  The “viewers” are no longer just benefactors that are helping people far away.  The viewers are finally being interacted with."
37,"Jan 13, 2021",This would make a great anime.

37,"Jan 13, 2021",THE AUDACITY THE DARING OMG I AM LOVING THIS
37,"Jan 13, 2021","really enjoy seeing him bend and break the ""rules"" to fit his needs at the time."
37,"Jan 13, 2021","After this chapter I believe one day we will find that constellations are just TWSA players who have gained enough Fame and fortune to start sponsoring incarnations. As their story grows, as Dokja said, so does their power and wealth. Dokja will be a constellation by the end of this series or I'll eat my underwear. EDIT: Just want to be clear; I never knew there was a LN of this and I was just taking a shot in the dark, but going to go read it now!"
37,"Jan 13, 2021","I'm 100% Huiwon, sleeping in the middle of a crisis situation!"
37,"Jan 13, 2021",this webtoon is so interesting. would love to see how it all unfolds. dokja is just so fucking cool man.
37,"Jan 13, 2021",Well everyone let’s sit back and enjoy another week of dokja and his slyness as the US falls into its apocalyptic ways it’s self in the capital 😂😅
37,"Jan 13, 2021","This is some ""In Soviet Russia, Dokja contract you"" type of wild"

37,"Jan 13, 2021","when you can shock the constellation ""prisoner of the golden headband"" into dropping his staff. Dokja: Drop the mic pull your phone out and walk it out😂😏😎😎😎"
37,"Jan 13, 2021",Damn this is my number one favorite webtoon
37,"Jan 13, 2021",Fun fact: Sunfish could died from stress.
37,"Jan 13, 2021",I loved Bilyoung's expressions this chapter!
37,"Mar 3, 2021","lmaooo Dokja put a new meaning to ""get owned"" 😂🤣"
37,"Jan 13, 2021",YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH I MISS SEEING DOKJA AND BIHYEONG BICKERING 😭😂 my heart is happy
37,"Jan 29, 2021","""Give him an ass whooping,"" I'M DYING!! 😂😂😂In the manhwa the line is ""hit him on the back of his head."" "
37,"Jan 13, 2021",he scammed a constilation... I want to do that
37,"Jan 13, 2021","Haha dude that was an epic change of pace,  Dokja is always one step ahead. "
37,"Jan 13, 2021",Dokja really said your my bitch now huh.I respect the hussle!
37,"Jan 13, 2021","I bet the title is actually what his constellation name will be after he becomes a galactic legend, The Omniscient Reader "
37,"Jan 13, 2021",Gong Pildu is going to be such a high defense level now w. It’s time for Dokja to show Junghyeok that he  can be a proper companion and rescue him :^)
37,"Jan 13, 2021","Someone said this would make a great anime. i agree, but don't let CR or Webtoon produce it and screw it up like the others."
37,"Mar 3, 2021","I really wish the translation team would add the korean honorifics! In this chapter, Bihyung went from screaming at KDJ to calling him ""Dokja-nim"" which shows his slight fear towards him after the constellation accepted his offer. I'm sad :(((("
37,"Jan 13, 2021",Bihyung has finally figured out that he signed a contract with a difficult person...
37,"Jan 13, 2021",Inspired by Dokjas commanding spirit!!(5 coins Donated)
37,"Jan 13, 2021","*secretive plotter* ""damn"" *prisoner of golden headband* ""damn!?"" *abyssal black flame dragon* ""DAMN?!?!?!"""
37,"Mar 3, 2021","actually when bihyung see dokja sponsored a constellation, in other translation bihyung suddenly aknowledge dokja as ""Dokja-nim"" -nim is honorific to called other people who more superior. and it take bihyung surprised like ""what type a human I made a contract with"" 😂 and also bihyung witness how a human can make one chanel collapse"
37,"Mar 3, 2021",Yoo Joonghyuk falling into his regression depression...it makes me sad
37,"Mar 3, 2021","Dokja doesn't get any sponsors, he sponsors YOU"
37,"Jan 13, 2021",i swear dokja is going to give me a heartattack sometime in the future
37,"Mar 3, 2021",I love how Pildu became a property himself after keeping everyone off his property. And I'm glad that Dokja found such a smart solution. There was no way Pildu would not have tried to hurt him and his friends after the scenario and now as his property he literally is unable to do that so everyone's safe.
37,"Jan 13, 2021","I feel that if this was a anime it would be  almost as popular as AOT, and dokja isn't overpowered he's just smart on how he uses the knowledge we obtained, please leave a like on this so it could become a anime."
37,"Mar 3, 2021","I mean I know dokja read it all and has special abilities but still, he's a freaking genius"
37,"Mar 3, 2021","Pildu is a bastard, but it actually made me happy and it was really adorable that his supporting constellation actually cares for his life! "
37,"Mar 3, 2021","I swear constellations’ comments are nearly the most hilarious thing about this comic🤣 you’d expect the author to use a really “high-end” style of speaking, but it’s just simple words you and I would say and overall it’s a great element of the webtoon 👌🏼"
37,"Mar 3, 2021",Dokja would have been a terrifying lawyer 
37,"Mar 3, 2021",did... did he just employ a god from a dead world?
37,"Jan 13, 2021","huh. Don't see Dokja having an ""oh shit"" moment very often. It seems to becoming more and more clear that this iteration has deviated from the story he reads. I bet there's going to come a point where he won't be able to rely on it at all. I guess the question is if he'll be able to handle it without that information. "
37,"Feb 25, 2021",Y’all I’m so happy this is the first time Dokja has referred to them as his friends :”)
37,"Mar 3, 2021",Imagine getting on dokjas bad side during this apocalypse 
37,"Jan 13, 2021",I love how scary dokja can become lol 
37,"Jan 13, 2021","holy f*cking sh*it dokja. I'm just...I can't...there are no words that can possibly convey dokja's pure, uncontrollable badassery."
37,"Mar 3, 2021",Hahaha Dokja making Pildu more powerful by forcing him into a corner and beating the crap out of him with monsters. LEVEL UP
37,"Mar 3, 2021","I see some reader get annoyed because get spoiled. I also hated for whoever give spoiler without give proper warning 😤 bcs this story is full of twist. I want to give advice for who didnt want to get spoiled : 1. don't see the reply of top comment 2. don't have too much look in comment 3. and the important part, don't search the fanart! ORV fandom is one of the most productive fandom who created ton of fanart, there's a lot of fanart that illustrated the novel, even the novel ending itself. "
37,"Mar 3, 2021",Dokja looking at Huiwon as he reads his phone screen is literally me looking at my mom as I read this webtoon.

37,"Mar 3, 2021",I NEED THIS ANIME. PLEASE. 
37,"Mar 3, 2021","minor detail, but I like how dokja referred to the others as ""his friends."" i'm anxious that he only sees them as an investment / means to an end for his own survival, especially with gilyeong."

37,"Mar 3, 2021","Well ,this masterpiece never fail to impress me ."
37,"Mar 3, 2021",The other face I enjoy seeing other than Dokja's smug look when things are going his way is Bihyeong's reactions to his ingenious schemes going as planned 😂
37,"Jan 13, 2021","Okay, we’re using term ‘Story’ here. And that’s all okay. But please please Please PLEASE. BE. CONSISTENT. And don’t suddenly change the term to Fable, Myth, Tale or whatever. ‘Story’ is already used here, so please stick with it until this webtoon finished."
37,"May 2, 2021","ayeee i am LOVING this story. the author and artists have done an amazing job. i usually don't read action/adventure because i get bored in the middle, but every single episode has left me thinking about where the next episode will lead us to. ugh it just makes me want to talk about this webtoon to all of my friends"

37,"Mar 3, 2021",I love how confident Dokja is in his actions and decisioning making. He has never second guessed himself and it’s paying off. He’s so different from that first episode. Character development king right there

37,"Mar 3, 2021","He's the most badass and interesting person in this story, but Dokja has repeatedly expressed that he doesn't consider. Himself a main character, even being shocked at supporting characters showing interest in him. I just want to know how he even walks with those giant balls"

37,"Mar 6, 2021","Some small constellations are truly quite impressive though. Look at Master of Steel, or Maritime War God! Kim Dokja has the right idea, amassing allies like he is. Though, it’s useless if you don’t grow strong yourself 😉. Lol I see Dokja is taking full advantage already though! These little silly moments have to be enjoyed. After all, are we not like the Constellations as readers ourselves? Are we not the ones who give value to this story? What is a story without a reader? Can it truly exist?"
37,"Mar 5, 2021",“Ass whooping” 😂😭
37,"Mar 5, 2021","This is such a good webtoon oml. The story already had an interesting fourth wall viewpoint but the actual story he read is super well developed. This is the first webtoon I’ve been addicted to in awhile. Sadly, I’m broke and have to wait here on this cliff 😫"

37,"Mar 4, 2021",Lol I think this dungeon is where a bunch of misunderstandings will happen in aiding our moody regressor (having read the novel). I hope this webtoon keeps the jokes hehehe
37,"Mar 4, 2021","Bruh this should become a anime, like tbh everyone would pay to watch this. But imagine how bada$$ the scenes would be when they activate their attributes. I’d be like “period go whoop that mfs a$$!!!!”.lmao 😂😂and can we talk about how not only are Dokja and Junghyeok yu bada$$ but they are fine as hell, idk if it’s just me 😏😏😏😂"
37,"Mar 4, 2021",{ The Constellation <<The Softest Boi >>  is very invested in the story. He smiles in anticipation }

37,"Mar 3, 2021","Want to know something awesome about Dokja. He's okay with change. I know most of you probably don't understand the importance, but most of humanities problems have been thanks to humans not wanting change and selfishness. Dokja, he wrecked the whole story and is flipping the world as we don't know it on it's edge and he's okay with it. He's obsessed with the characters, not the plot. It's often the opposite in any of these types of novels/comics. I appreciate his uniqueness. 😊"
37,"Mar 3, 2021",So much goes on in each episode I almost wanna start rereading the series to get a better grasp on all the pieces!

An interesting tidbit that the constellations need to be remembered like Rise of the Guardian's level belief creates power. Sounds like you simply need to become a historical figure much like the monk constellation or a myth, your story needs to be passed on to become a constellation. So if a historical figure can become a constellation, could a player also if they are remembered?"

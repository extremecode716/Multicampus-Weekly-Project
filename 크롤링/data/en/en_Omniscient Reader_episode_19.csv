19,"Oct 14, 2020",Ive decided to read both this comic and the novel 
19,"Oct 28, 2020","This is the first chapter where I have preferred this translation, almost purely because of the line: ‚Äúa few constellations are relived you are not an IDIOT.‚Äù Also made a little more sense than the original translation I read"
19,"Oct 17, 2020",He really thought ahead. Not only does he know the future but he's extremely smart. If I were half as smart as him I could get into a great college

19,"Oct 28, 2020",I'm looking forward to her kill that rapest!
19,"Oct 28, 2020",I like her Huiwon has this badass side but also this sort of craziness. Also the fact that she has the demon slayer is so cool but it also means that she can become very dangerous and out of control 
19,"Oct 14, 2020",Ahhh I‚Äôve never used 5 coins faster in my life
19,"Oct 28, 2020",i swear to god if something happens to that kid... #protectsmallbeans
19,"Oct 28, 2020","If ORV (Omniscient Reader) were to be featured in Webtoon Now, I wish they get to interview both the authors and artists. Fun fact, the authors for ORV's novel are a couple and I really want to know how they came up with such a great story, I've been so curious hehe"
19,"Oct 21, 2020",Hah! I just spent the free 5 coins that I earned from the 5 day survival challenge of this webtoon.

19,"Jan 20, 2021",I'd be very suspicious if the number of readers of this webtoon drops down to 1 by the end of it 
19,"Oct 28, 2020","I really like how the attribute crouching figure has so much potential. It's like someone the Author only meant to be a background character, so her personality and powers aren't that fleshed out. and that's what gives her so many possibilities."
19,"Oct 28, 2020",I would die for Gilyeong no questions asked. The precious kid paid for the chocolate- I can't. I'm going to root for HIM the most now.
19,"Oct 28, 2020","NOoOoO the kid is too sweet, we need to protect him-"
19,"Oct 28, 2020",ah he took all of the money which is now more valuable 
19,"Oct 28, 2020","the kid is so sweet tho, he definitely cares about dokja"
19,"Oct 28, 2020","So that's the reason why Dokja sold all his food, he knew this is going to happen. What a shrewd badass."
19,"Oct 28, 2020",Am I the only one that thinks it‚Äôs creepy how Dokja smiled when things got bad

I also like the new girl, and considering how much Dokja knows about the story and all the things that are in it, I think she'll become a good companion. (Oof I've been listening to NCT way too much.

19,"Oct 28, 2020",the second the creator of this story creates and releases dokkaebi plush dolls as merch I'm buying them all üòç
19,"Oct 28, 2020","So basically, living in a world controlled by Dokkaebai is cheaper than living in America. Cool, sign me up for the apocalypse. Worst comes to worst, I die, but at least I die in a really cool and dramatic way."

19,"Feb 27, 2021","My boi Dokja be so smart. It's so fun seeing Inho's disappointed face. Lol they're relieved why would they think Dokja is an idiot though? Woah it looks like the person Dokja rescued is quite bold, she can be a good main character. It looks like the kid Gilyeong Lee is more awesome than we thought. LMAO Huiwon is getting trust issues and thinks Dokja is sus. She has some really good stats and have limitless potential, guess she's really a main character now more than Sangah and Hyeonseong."

19,"Oct 29, 2020","he didn't try to rape her, he did rape her. "
19,"Oct 28, 2020",interesting how they changed some of the discriptions of this episode. they ended up making less extreme statements. in the novel dokja asked her if she stops them will she pay for food for them. will she take responsibility if they die of starvation?

19,"Mar 18, 2021",as a collective the group should've been working towards completing the scenario with the strongest leading the charge. that leader should've used the incite skill to encourage cooperation and productivity but typical of a selfish asshole he used it to be a villain. how cliche
19,"Feb 11, 2021",she is a demon slayer?? wow

If you have no coins, no matter how strong you currently are, and how prudently and astutely you act, you will eventually die. Because you can't avoid scenarios, and those will only become harder."

19,"May 5, 2021",Am I yhe only one thingking that this girl might be the last one standing alive in the end. It's because our main hero (Dokja) isn't supposed to be existing there and the protagonist of the novel who was incarnated a times before can actually change the flow of the events. Like the no. of survivors in cabin and the leaving of the protagonist in the station. And the survival of this girl who was supposed to die but got saved by our hero so the natural flow of events got disturbed.

He mention to his friend that he will charge them before the event where he tells the crowd he will charge them for food. It isn't a big deal but the way it is in the novel does make him seem like less of an hypocrite or he might have predicted this would happen.

65,"Aug 11, 2021","Friendly history lesson: [Adventure who makes the egg stand up] is referring to Christopher Columbus. It’s referring to his story where he posed the question of how to make an egg stand, and no one could answer but he solved it by cracking the bottom of the egg. It’s a story championing innovative methods, hence why he liked Huiwon’s portable flagpole idea ✌🏼"
65,"Aug 11, 2021","See everyone? It’s not the size of your muscles, it’s the size of your wallet that counts."

65,"Aug 11, 2021",MIA YU IS KIRBY OMGedit: the fact that Lazy Broke Weeb replied to this makes me feel so honored 
65,"Aug 11, 2021",this man seriously hoarded his coins just for the chance to beat the main character's ass with overwhelming strength that goes away right after the scenario. 🤦🏻‍♂️ dang it dokja.
65,"Aug 11, 2021","Jungeok Yu: IM GOING GO KILL YOU-
Dokja: *loots everything he can* oh hey man what's up?"
65,"Aug 11, 2021",When you grind so hard even the final boss becomes another NPC.
65,"Aug 11, 2021",Lmao he just loves to make the most powerful guy hate him even more. I mean really he's doing it again.I cant..I just can't 😂

65,"Aug 11, 2021","Dokja made the same face I did when that dude got his head lopped off, but the real jaw dropper was that little girl belching the damn flagpole up 😂😂😂"
65,"Aug 11, 2021","Mans said, "" I've invested all for this moment."""

65,"Aug 11, 2021",This girl be like Marry Poppins pulling things out of her mouth
65,"Aug 11, 2021",Dokja= P2W (Pay to win)
65,"Aug 12, 2021",Yoo Mia being hungry is the reason why Yoo Joonghyuk cooking skill is lvl 10 
65,"Aug 11, 2021",Huiwon got bored waiting at the station so she brought the whole station with her XD
65,"Aug 12, 2021",he has the power of God and capitalism on his side
65,"Sep 15, 2021",Dokja had always been about those coins since the beginning of the scenarios. Looks like it was worth it. He has way more coins than the protagonist himself. This was an interesting strategy of why and how he sent the protagonist on a useless quest. And probably for the first time Dokja will actually beat his ass. Junghyeok won't know what hit him.
65,"Aug 11, 2021","So many good & hilarious moments in this episode! Sooyoung getting Dokja bonked & robbed, Dokja being a rat bastard, adorable Kirby Yoo Mia & her shading Dokja, innovative Heewon 😅, Joonghyuk being badass. So excited to see the results of Dokja's efforts in saving so much coins"
65,"Aug 15, 2021","Junghyeok: ""Why do I hear boss music?"" "
65,"Aug 11, 2021",Mia is so cute!! AND BYE NOT HER CALLING DOKJA UGLY 💀💀
65,"Sep 15, 2021","I am constantly amazed by the outright audacity of these characters. Mostly just Dokja, but freaking Huiwon with the flag base outdid him today."
65,"Sep 15, 2021","Dokja: He may have found a loophole, but I have found that he has found that loophole."
65,"Sep 15, 2021",the little sister is as brutal as her brother for saying he is ugly😂
65,"Aug 11, 2021","gotta say, the little girl spitting the flagpole and the clapping after he planted the flag were hilarious lol"
65,"Aug 11, 2021",ONE PAAAAAAAAAWNCH
65,"Sep 15, 2021",All of Dokja's saved coins would have been useless if Huiwon did not save his ass. 🤣🤣🤣
65,"Sep 15, 2021","I love how Junghyeok thinks he is all that spending 400 coins at a time on upgrades and Dokja is out here spending 4,000 at a time"
65,"Sep 15, 2021",Is Sangah holding Gilyeong AND the Mjölnir????
65,"Sep 16, 2021",Has no one noticed that Sangah is holding the hammer now???? She’s carrying Gilyeong and has the hammer in her hand now since he is too tired. She is also worthy! 
65,"Aug 11, 2021","[The Constellation ""Analytic of Existance"" looks forward to Dokja Kim's iconic ""Punch That Made The Protagonist Bounce Off A Solid Wall Multiple Times""] [5 Coins have been sponsored in anticipation.]"
65,"Sep 15, 2021",I really love when dokja is out of his element and someone else has a plan to help him and he’s like “… but… I’m supposed to be the smartest….”
65,"Sep 15, 2021","I like that the MC miscalculated for once, even just a little."
65,"Aug 11, 2021",I’m totally jealous of the amount of coins he has spent to just be wasted on powering up!
65,"Aug 12, 2021","He went from Dokja Kim to one punch man in the matter of 72000 coins. I wanna do that…
You think pennies would work?"
65,"Aug 11, 2021",She brought the flagpole lmao
65,"Aug 11, 2021",MIA IS A KIRBY
65,"Aug 11, 2021","Every companion of Dokja is just better, without them he would have a much harder time with everything and that just makes them better, 11/10 for them"
65,"Sep 15, 2021",today on capitalism
65,"Sep 16, 2021",I love that Dokja's goal for the last 10 chapters was to create a situation where he can punch Junghyeok in the face as hard as possible
65,"Sep 15, 2021",Props to this guy for not hesitating to use someone as a human shield
65,"Sep 16, 2021","Why does everyone keep saying Dokja is ugly, pfffft. He's quite a catch damn it, brains, body and a cute face. 🤔 Though I won't lie, I thought ""Step on me Daddy"" when Jungheyook was kicking the screen "
65,"Sep 16, 2021","Hah, Huiwon came up with a plan that even Dokja didn't consider.  Nice to see Dokja be left gobsmacked every once in a while."

I’m literally simping for this man on a daily, stop lying "
65,"Sep 16, 2021","Who would have thought Junghyeok would have a sister like that? I mean, I didn’t expect him to have a sister, but upon discovering he does, she kinda seems to fit the bill lol. Also, that ability, awesome."
65,"Sep 15, 2021","Huiwon: who are you Little girl: I'm hungry

65,"Aug 11, 2021","Huiwon literally just enlightened me with the flag hole. I just couldn’t stop laughing! Btw, is there any one like me that got excited when Junhyeok finally meet up with Deokja again? Or should I say, chased after Deokja? 🌚🌚🌚"
65,"Aug 12, 2021",that was a 2000 iq play from Mia and Huiwon
65,"Sep 16, 2021",his sister ate the pole?? HAHAH 
65,"Aug 11, 2021",The most intense pay to win battle I have ever seen in my life. This man literally swiped his discover card an discovered them stats. 
65,"Sep 15, 2021","Not gonna lie though, this ep made me realize how attractive Junghyeok really is... like, this man... Is ATTRACTIVE... but Dokja is nowhere near ugly💀😂"
65,"Sep 15, 2021","For a guy who wants to survive, Dokja sure is pissing off the protagonist a lot."
65,"Aug 11, 2021","Not dokja using real people as shields, he say “gee I’m sorry”"
65,"Sep 16, 2021",MC be like: so you think you got bank? [drops 70k] let me introduce myself you can call me Mr. Moneybags.

65,"Aug 11, 2021",all those times i cursed dokja to use a bit of his coin… well played dokja
65,"Aug 11, 2021",Me: *Realizes I just ran out of coins and immediately goes to buy more* lol.

65,"Sep 16, 2021","Dokja just casually throwing coins cause he can just get more via the dokkaebi I- yall, that contract was signed before he even reached the stations"

65,"Sep 16, 2021",The number of likes are going down every episode despite the warnings embedded in the story of what happens to those who renounce😂
65,"Sep 16, 2021","Huiwon you absolute GENIUS! And bruh, what a god move Dokja, idky im surprised, go kick ass!"
65,"Sep 15, 2021",Dokja was collecting coins until he got over 80000 just to hit junghyuk? RIP that guy. We wont see him after that

65,"Sep 20, 2021",Junghyeok probably got his coins by killing everyone in his path. I'm guessing most people don't have much coins and Dokja got the rich to pay him. I guess in business target the rich is better than the masses in this case.

65,"Sep 16, 2021",Dokja the troll strikes again!!! He’s been plotting this moment of revenge ever since Jungheoyuk pushed him off the bridge in the first scenario. Talk about petty 😂😂😂😂
65,"Sep 16, 2021","I feel like he plagiarist character will have a role later on in the story.., maybe? And the neutral kind seems.... too neutral. Idk it just seems weird that he’s this neutral considering this entire situation "
65,"Sep 16, 2021",That's cheating he has all those coins and I have zero. 😔 
65,"Sep 16, 2021",#Pay-2-Win in the most basic forms.
65,"Sep 16, 2021",Damn the Neutral King be the only one with sense of safety in this entire webtoon huh

65,"Sep 15, 2021",They just took that flag pole!!!xDIt feels like they cheated!!!xD
65,"Sep 15, 2021","Ugh, I am kinda disgusted by the restrictions of the last fight. Sounds like an EA game in which you must do microtransactions to win(love the comic, it is just that the Dokkaebi seems like complete asshole for allowing that and Then proclaim that it is fair) "
65,"Sep 15, 2021",For the First time Dokja Said is this even allowed xD

65,"May 3, 2022",I’ve been curious about this for awhile and maybe it’s because I’m slow but what did they mean by plausible? I googled it but it didn’t seem to match this context. And how would the human ‘Kings’ become king? Do they have to be intuned with their constellation or something?

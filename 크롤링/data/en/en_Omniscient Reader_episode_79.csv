79,"Nov 17, 2021",Hmm I admit they‚Äôre both suspicious. Better be safe and marry both of them 
79,"Nov 17, 2021","Sangah scares me because she really valued human life and didn't want to kill people until she realized that even a child was okay with it...now she takes out DOZENS of people like it's nothing. That kind of change is terrifying and a bit sad, although it is definitely necessary to survive. Damn...I wonder what exactly she had to go through "
79,"Nov 17, 2021","Always be wary of HR. First Toby becomes the Scranton Strangler, and you have Sang-Ah becoming a cutthroat assasin."

79,"Nov 17, 2021","so i'm pretty sure the only reason people weren't becoming stronger was because dokja likes to finesse everything, alot of his actions involve work arounds and knowledge, so everyones growth was stifled abut in exchange they got knowledge which let them geow more effectively"
79,"Nov 17, 2021","Honeslty sangah worries me, she probably not even in the best mental state atm either considering how drastically she changed in a few days "
79,"Nov 17, 2021","Why all the women in this comic sus as hell, mc safer with the og mc who literally wants to one shot him..."
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Sangah became a certified badass in his absence... 
79,"Nov 17, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" was amazed on the the massive growth of the incarnation ""ysa"" and is now suspicious on its sponsor. ][The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" warns the incarnation ""kdj"" to not be distracted and focus on the upcoming disaster.][5 coins have been sponsored. ] //Edit: Merry Christmas guys üéÖ"
79,"Nov 17, 2021",When you realize that technically KDJ's the only one in their 4 Man Band that's not in black ü§£
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Can we appreciate how great sangah looks for a second?
79,"Nov 17, 2021",On this week of ‚ÄúWHO‚ÄôS THE IMPOSTER‚Äù we‚Äôve got Sangah who hated killing a few days ago now mass murdering with maximum efficiency. [+5 coins]
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Love that last panel. Badass ladies ready to slay em allllll
79,"Nov 17, 2021",I want what happened to Sangah that made her kill people so easily. 
79,"Nov 17, 2021",What did Sangha GO through?? She looks like it‚Äôs been rough for her these past couple days. üò≠üò≠
79,"Nov 17, 2021","Oh my, Sangah's outfit tho"
79,"Nov 17, 2021","wow the artists really give the Yoos the most badass entrance and coolest outfit huh. talking about good genes and playing favourite lol, not that I'm complaining though, each character have their own time to shine üòÖ but damn those details on the color black is hella mesmerising, the overall art improved a lot too since episode 1! and I also love how the artists give each character their own details, it adds certain depth in the story"
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Holy crap! Looks like Sangha has enrolled in The Natasha Romanov School of Fashion and Kickassery üòÅ
79,"Nov 17, 2021",2 dangerous woman at dokja's command üò≥üò≥
79,"Nov 17, 2021","I mean I think Dokja should be careful of them both, not just one lol these women could kill him at any moment "
79,"Nov 17, 2021","Ok. At the beginning of the comic, I knew the artist intended to make Sangah busty, but humble. This is just plain mobius curves I'm witnessing"
79,"Nov 17, 2021",I really hope Sangah stays true to Dokja...
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Sangah looks so tired though. Poor woman
79,"Nov 17, 2021",I LOVE STRONG WOMEN !!!
79,"Nov 17, 2021",I forgot how to breath for a second. 
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Is her constellation a greek hero? Theseus maybe. He used the thread before right? 
79,"Nov 17, 2021","man tbf its really hard to judge who's trustworthy, esp in an apocalypse"
79,"Nov 17, 2021","OK so now we know she has hermes as a constalation and the strong must be from hermeses lyre. she also uses daggers but for that im assuming it comes from the fact hermes ruled over wealth, good fortune, commerce, fertility, and thievery. it would explain everything else.  let it also be noted hermes is also very well known as a trickster"
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Someone sold her soul to the Devil It seems... Curious to find out!
79,"Nov 23, 2021","Everyone be like suspicious of YSA and HSY but damn, the most suspicious one is really Kim Dokja. If this was in another character's perspective, KDJ would be the mysterious character who ends up being MADly overpowered. "
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Jungheok just helplessly sitting on the floor had me dead üòÇ.
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Yu Junghyeok in the background:üßé‚ÄùI sits‚Äù
79,"Nov 25, 2021",i like how the 2 supporting women aren't healers or love interests for onceüôèüèº
79,"Nov 18, 2021","everyone saying she's sus and dokja should be wary - I'm hardpressed to distrust her so quickly. sure she' might have some new secrets, but she's been earnest and loyal from the start. the first disciple, on the other hand, has had ulterior motives from the start"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",sangah got the boob belt but junghyeok didnt (ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÅÔ∏ø‚Ä¢ÃÄÔΩ°)
79,"Nov 17, 2021","There definitely is something more to Sangah's change. For her not only to improve so much, but also become so accustomed to killing. I hope she remains a positive character, since there are so few of them. On a side note, Sangah with the first disciple look so badass together at the end there"
79,"Dec 22, 2021","non novel readers : sangah kinda sus‚Ä¶ some novel readers : YOOO THE GIRLFRIENDS, HSY AND YSAAAA‚Ä¶ the other novel readers : YSA IN CATSUIT! NEXT ITS A CERTAIN SOMEONE TO COSPLAY YSA IN KDJ‚Äôs FAV ‚Äúdress‚Äù"

79,"Nov 17, 2021",Dokja: She's pretty well equipped.Us: Yeah she is... ;)
79,"Dec 22, 2021",I honestly think that it's on purpose that she got powered up sm in the absence of dokja..Her constellation was always secretive..
79,"Nov 17, 2021",I love suyeong and sangah‚Äôs interactions.
79,"Dec 25, 2021",Theyre both very suspicious.  Best just to avoid both of them and marry the man you've been carrying on you back and bickering with for the past two episodes.
79,"Dec 22, 2021",so is no one gonna talk about how sad and hard  it must have been to junghyeok for losing his friends over and over again. damn man really had his hopes high into believing that his lover may still recognize him
79,"Nov 23, 2021","Sangah looks tired also probably because she is using too much power from her ""constellation"" üò¢"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",All this focus on Sangah and Dokja never asked about where Huiwon might be :(
79,"Nov 18, 2021","the art is getting good, it's pretty much getting along with the novel too, so far.. there are some times where some scenes doesn't show, thats fine. I love it, making webtoon readers curious enough to find the novel and read it, more detailed stuff happens to dokja before the current chapter, pretty good stuff"
79,"Nov 17, 2021","Sangah has always been unique but the author hasn't revealed the plot yet. Remember she was there from the beginning and Dokja has mentioned her mystery periodically. There's no telling who she is yet, but I do not think she's an imposter, rather we're getting some development toward her true purpose in this comic."
79,"Nov 23, 2021",Yoo Sangah my love!
79,"Nov 17, 2021",SANGAH A BADASS
79,"Dec 27, 2021",Why is sangah so hot

79,"Dec 22, 2021",why people being suspicious of her strength and didn't care about her highlight in this chapter? üòÇ i almost die seeing her beautifulness just now lol üòÜ
79,"Dec 22, 2021","I think I understand what happened to Sangah. This wholw time with Dokja taking charge of everything, she'd been able to maintain a certain level of psychological distance from the carnage and mayhem. She'd been able to aoldier on under the guise that she was on some level being taken care of. But the moment she found herself on her own, she found herself having to make a choice, and she made it quickly Her sudden growth may be in part due to her mental state finally catching up to her situation"
79,"Dec 22, 2021","these two girls are suspicious, beautiful, badass, my wif-"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Sangah √ó Sooyoung ISHIPIT! 
79,"Dec 22, 2021",JUST A REMINDER: Incarnations don't have to be sponsored by a constellation from the same country as them. So Sangah isn't necessarily sponsored by a South Korean constellation.
79,"Nov 28, 2021",Sangah in The tight assassin outfit be like .....üí°‚ö° üî• üî• üî• üî•
79,"Nov 20, 2021","I've been waiting for Sangah's return as a total badass, and I was not disappointed!! The artist depicted her just how I imagined her in the webnovel!"
79,"Nov 17, 2021","[The Constellation, LADY OF THE SINGULAR FOOTWEAR, has been shocked speechless at Sangah's transformation. Also she is loving the new outfit. 5 coins have been gifted]"
79,"Dec 29, 2021","sangah is black widow,doctor strange and Spiderman?"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",nah bc they're both suspicious üò≠
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Its strange that between Seyoung a former and recent antagonist and Sangah who has been with us since the very beginning I trust Seyoung more Sangah has always been dodgy about her supporting constellation and implied that they made her promise not to tell anyone else who they are for some reason her and both Seyoung and Joonghyuk where very suspicion of her immediately
79,"Dec 22, 2021","""Wich one"" that was my exact question lol. it seems like our mc will start living some of the betrayals that Junghyeok experienced with his regressions... or will be up to him holding the group together"

79,"Dec 22, 2021","huiwon, hyeonseong, gilyeong.. i hope you're all okay üò¢"
79,"Nov 18, 2021","Sangah looks weird her values on human life vs. her actions now, the lack of light in her eyes, the flushed cheeks under her eyes brings in alot of questions about if it's really her or if her mental health went down the drain"

79,"Dec 22, 2021",holy shit sangah and sooyoung next to next got me asking for more
79,"Dec 22, 2021","Women. Women, right? BUT WAIT WAIT WAIT. *gestures towards ORV women* WOMEN.....who can kill you."
79,"Nov 18, 2021",Sangah is hella badass now isn't she
79,"Nov 18, 2021",And in the end it turns out Sangah was the author all along‚Ä¶..
79,"Nov 17, 2021","Omg, what a change, I really wonder what happened when Sangah was away.Btw she's looking soo good."
79,"Nov 17, 2021",sangah outfit looks like the female version of junghyeok's. is he also wearing a high rarity green meteorite equipment?

79,"Dec 27, 2021",I just read all of this in 2 days‚Ä¶  something is wrong with me 
79,"Dec 27, 2021",just checking how they were adapting the novel... seems like they aren't rushing things.. gud! 
79,"Dec 27, 2021","Sangah remains awesome! And this‚Ä¶ well, she certainly is no slouch, not with her supporter! And ninja wire really is so underrated. Leave it to Junghyuk to note an issue in the bluntest way possible. Dokja opens the way for potential, but he can‚Äôt actually help people utilize it. And yeah, the company Kim Dokja keeps certainly has extraordinary luck üòÜ"
79,"Dec 26, 2021",sangah may be sus but I would still simp for her 
79,"Dec 26, 2021",i miss Gilyeong :(
79,"Dec 26, 2021","‚Ä¶ well sangah was hot before, but that new outfit‚Ä¶ well damn I‚Äôm definitely bi"
79,"Dec 26, 2021",I have yet to see them eat their first meal out of 3 that they need to have for the scenario.
79,"Dec 24, 2021","Last panel is how you do a ""girl power"" scene, not like marvel's end game "
79,"Dec 23, 2021",A GIRL DUO
79,"Dec 23, 2021",Interesting comparison at the end. Sangah has more light shining on her but her cloths are stained with the blood of the people she‚Äôs killed. On the other hand the first disciple (can‚Äôt remember her name) has less light shined on her but her cloths have zero blood. 
79,"Dec 23, 2021",Everyone: Sangha=badass assassin!!!   Me: Are they all eating like they're supposed to by the rules of the scenario? I haven't seen them eat more than once... should I be worried? it'll all work out right surely...
79,"Dec 22, 2021",everyone saying they're both suspicious then im here like I LOVE IT WHEN WOMENN
79,"Dec 22, 2021","can't wait to see the best power couple of the whole novel, and naturaly sangha with gaterbelt"
79,"Dec 22, 2021","I think Dojka is going to crack under the immense pressure, even though the fourth wall exists. Like he has to keep the Regressor alive for him to not regress, he has to keep the First Apostle in check, he has to stop the catastrophe, he has to figure out why his former companion became so strong, all while trying to follow the plot, I think he'll start to crack"
79,"Dec 22, 2021",oh damn i really can't trust either of them but anyway that last panel they look so ..üî• my god. girlbosses..
79,"Dec 22, 2021","i will admit that sangah is a bit,,, sus,,,, BUT i will not deny that i had a bit of a bi panic for a couple scenes..."
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Anyone else realize that mc getting rlly weak compared to his companions? I feel this story doesn‚Äôt follow the plot of ‚Äúcompanions suck compared to mc‚Äù

79,"Dec 22, 2021","oh _my _gawd _, it's just been a week and sangah is üí£?Now ,I am really curious about her constellation and why is it so secretive ..Is she example of SSS-grade talent??"
79,"Dec 22, 2021","since Sanga was using both Ariadne's and Hermes' stigmas, does she have multiple constellations? or like a group of constellations under one name? like ""Greek Gods"""
79,"Dec 22, 2021",sangsooüòî
79,"Dec 21, 2021","hey guys, you should go back to the first episode snd reread it, its crazy how far ahead the author planned some stuff. there are all of our beloved characters in the first ep, plus some that we haven't met yet! I couldn't imagine Sangah's growth from the beginning to now, its crazy to see her from the beginning again! I really hope we get to see him use the bookmark skill from early on or smth to stop the catastrophe, maybe he could use bookmark to learn the winds"
79,"Nov 18, 2021",Uh oh. The light in Sangah‚Äôs eyes are gone 
79,"Nov 17, 2021",Sang-Ah's constellation is Doflamingo how else is she good at using threads to kill people

79,"Dec 28, 2021",Is it just me or did Sangah get a lot hotter?
79,"Dec 27, 2021",lol the characters are really cool anyways and it's cool how they all have their own growth and worth and development in the story lol it makes it much better anyways this is cool 
79,"Dec 27, 2021",yo where is that small insect kid?? he‚Äôs alive right?
79,"Dec 27, 2021",Go off queens üëë

79,"Dec 24, 2021","Sangah is SUS, now I remembering that her constelation bought a plot armor for her in first scenario creating a bridge. If I could bet, it's not only 1 but a group acting together like a association"
79,"Dec 24, 2021","Dokja you should be asking the important questions, WHERE IS THE CHILD??? "
79,"Dec 23, 2021",SANGSOO MOMENT LET'S GIVE IT UP FOR WOMEN!!!!!!!! 
79,"Dec 23, 2021","I just want to say, although this webtoon is a blast, the webnovel is also, and not only that it's like around 500 chapters ahead of the webtoon, and it's GREAT. i really reccomend everyone to try reading it because it's not actually too heavy of a reading material even though it's long (it isn't description heavy at all!), and you can read it in tandem of waiting for new webtoon  chapters to come. I mean, the entire novel's finished - why wait around with the webtoon?"
79,"Dec 22, 2021","""Is that Sangah?"" how did-? When did-? "
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Damn the last panel‚Ä¶ ü§©ü§© they are both so cool. Dokja please move aside so I can see the women at work better. 
79,"Dec 22, 2021","I guessed that her constellation is Arachne, but maybe I was wrong. The curse of Arachne was inflicted by Athena and Sangah can use one(?) of Hermes' stigma. The only individual that comes to mind is Perseus, the hero who adored by the gods. Hermes gave him winged sandals, Athena gave him a reflective shield, Hephaestus gave him sword and, Hades gave him the cap of invisibility. I even thought that it's the rope from Korean folktale of sun, moon and tiger."
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Whoa it so amazing that Sangah improve but something doesnt add quite right like how did she improve really quick in just like a few days?? i say that pretty sus and im also wondering what her constellation is?
79,"Dec 22, 2021",She's pretty well equipped üòèüòèüòè
79,"Dec 22, 2021",... can she tie me up and step on me please?
79,"Dec 22, 2021",my love for this series and characters esp.dokja is becoming more and more immesurable
79,"Dec 22, 2021","may or may not have professed my love for sangah multiple times this episode, but really i dont feel great about this situation, i mean on the surface she seems like sangah... without the mercy part-but she really FEELS different and i dunno what kinda underlying tone im picking up from this. I hope its not betrayal, i DEFINITELY hope its not death, atleast let her be on our side cmon now grant me my wish thats best girl right there..."
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Now I'm wondering about the huge character change in Sangah. Something seems to be there as she seemed genuinely happy to know about Pildu but something great must have happened for her to have such a radical change
79,"Dec 22, 2021",omg seeing Sangah reminded me of the kid. I forgot his name but I wonder where he is ü•≤ü•≤
79,"Dec 22, 2021",Those clothes be looking tight.  Nothing wrong there but ü•µ

She's changed drastically within a short amount of time, what exactly did she go through? It was only a couple chapters ago that she was concerned about Gilyeoung killing so easily, and now she's threading through people like a killing machine. I'm so curious now. WELL ig they're both sus, but that end scene was just mwah chefs kiss. We love to see it."

79,"Jan 5, 2022",she looks so badass in that outfit!!!
79,"Jan 4, 2022",I dont think Sangah did anything malicious. I am curious about her sponsor and they most likely helped her level up the way he did.  But i also think being separated from the guiro forced her to level up bc she had no one to rely on to protect or fight along side with her. Its a jungle out there and the only she could‚Äôve survived was to turn into a beast & quick

Sangah was attacking Lee Seolhwa's followers aka. people trying to wake up the meteorite (aka. people who are attacking and killing off others like Dokja who are trying to prevent the awakening of the disaster and other people who just happen to be there). Doesn't change the fact that Sangah's drastically changed though.

79,"Dec 22, 2021","If Sangah's supporting constellation is not Ariadne, perhaps her ability is not the golden thread, but the mythic golden fleece. Perseus stole the golden fleece and was gifted the winged sandles of Hermes, enabling flight. Maybe weaving the golden fleece into a web is related to Perseus having the support and guidance of Athena, who is the Goddess of both battle strategy and weaving. It would explain how she vastly improved her fighting abilities. Her supporting constellation is Perseus."

79,"Apr 19, 2022",damn what happened to sangah
79,"Apr 13, 2022",I love when women
79,"Apr 12, 2022",So if both are sus that clearly means Huiwon is best girl cause she isn't sus
79,"Apr 12, 2022","oh damn i had actually exactly thought sangah got the ariadne support constellation before. But then all constellations only ended up getting less and less mythic till everyone is just some ""great korean hero"" that won whatever battles... So if you only get local sponsors, why did even dokja think she got ariadne, who's part of greek mythology? .. so weird."
79,"Apr 10, 2022",WOMAN SUPREMACY
79,"Apr 10, 2022",just kill'em both
79,"Apr 9, 2022","It‚Äôs not a sub-scenario, it‚Äôs a sub-sub-scenario "
79,"Apr 8, 2022",Our girls go burrrrrrrrrrrrr
79,"Apr 8, 2022","I think Dokja has a point. His allies were able to grow because he gave them the foundations necessary to grow. I mean look and Huiwon, Jihye, Pildu, and Gilyeong. They all grew incredibly strong thanks to Dokja. Maybe Sangah and Hyeonseong we're too reliant on Dokja. They did lack confidence in their own ability and just needed that little push. He gave them all the necessary tools to survive. He shouldn't beat himself up too badly. It looks like Sangah has an SS tier ability that helped her."
79,"Apr 8, 2022","Well that was a lot more awkward than expected. I wonder why Sangah is so secretive about her power up. And yes Suyeong may have done some questionable things, she was genuinely trying to save the world. Wow Sangah got in upgrade in abilities, gear, and looks üòçüòç Too bad she's also more willing to kill. Must have had a lot happen to her. I wonder how the others are doing. "
79,"Apr 4, 2022",SANGHA YASSS MY GURLLLLL
79,"Apr 3, 2022",me seeing most of these theories in the comments trying to hold myself back from spoiling her identity
79,"Apr 2, 2022","I wonder why she was back at the situation? Don't they go to a personal place? Dokja and everyone else did, so why at the situation? I get she had a big role there, but wouldn't the transportation been in refer to a place before the world went to shit?"
79,"Apr 2, 2022",SUPER HERO LANDING!!!! \(^o^)/
79,"Mar 20, 2022",well this was sooner than I expected  to see his friends

79,"Feb 28, 2022"," I wouldn't even be suspicious about sangah getting stronger but seeing her killing ppl like it's nothing ,, literally doesnt make sense, she really valued human life days ago then how come she became like this in just 3 days?? hmm sus.. she probably have met  the poison girl whatever I forgot her nameüíÄ "
79,"Feb 25, 2022",Sangah you have become one $exy soab 
79,"Feb 25, 2022",I think Sangah might turn out to be the author of TWSA.
79,"Feb 23, 2022",such a good story and art
79,"Feb 22, 2022",hmm just a guess I'm not sure but I'm gonna say it rn that Sangah is the author..idk if this is a legit spoiler as I haven't read the novel but I can feel it in my bones that Sangah is the author of TWSA
79,"Feb 22, 2022",they both are so hot üòª
79,"Feb 21, 2022","Sangah was so cool, gorg and hot but kinda scary haha a lot of changes huh?"
79,"Feb 21, 2022",i didn't think Sangah could get hotter...ü§§
79,"Feb 17, 2022",sangah is too pretty for someone with eyebags
79,"Feb 17, 2022","So I know I‚Äôm really late to the party, but what if this Sangha isn‚Äôt the same sangha we knew. It seems like she‚Äôs been through a lot in a very short amount of time, not enough time really. I wonder if she is a sangha from a different point in time. That would explain her rapid growth and skill accumulation while also giving context to her awkwardness with our protagonist. Maybe she thinks he abandoned them or forgot about his people because, to her, he‚Äôs been gon much longer. Probably wrong tho"
79,"Feb 17, 2022",Day 78 of voicing all the characters

79,"Jan 16, 2022","It really is suspicious how Sungah improved so much alone. Also, back then she really valued human lives and didn't seem to like hurting others, but now she just dismembered all of those people like they were nothing, and doesn't seem regretfull at all"

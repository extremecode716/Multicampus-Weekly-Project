64,"Apr 7, 2022","Mwuahahaha die😂😂 What a way to subvert expectations. The plagiarist was a woman. A pretty hot woman 😍Smug faces on guys, punchable. Smug faces on girls, cute. Dokja still managed to finesse Suyeong by tricking everyone into thinking Demon Decapitator was a strong weapon. Maybe it has a condition like the seemingly useless Broken Faith. Dokja even set it up so Junghyeok would have all the kings in one place to take out. Big brain "

64,"Sep 8, 2021",I've seen fan arts of The Fake King. Han Sooyong or sumthin?

64,"Sep 8, 2021",SHE'S HERE
64,"Sep 8, 2021",Dokja: your late jungheyok and everyone else: Death wish right there

64,"Sep 8, 2021",oh no the take king is hot
64,"Sep 8, 2021",I sorta want Dokja to be supreme king. Why can’t he be really good?
64,"Sep 8, 2021",I’m not sure if plot armor will save him this time and by that I mean he’s gonna cheat the system since his plot armor didn’t work
64,"Sep 8, 2021",hsy… is so pretty i fell in love 
64,"Sep 8, 2021",the real thanos
64,"Sep 8, 2021",SuYeong is so pretty ❤❤❤

64,"Sep 8, 2021",Both Sooyoung and Joonghyuk are here. These next few chapters will be exciting
64,"Sep 8, 2021","Oh oh!!! :0. Dokja must be on “best buddy’s”Sh/t list to see him this angry. Considering how lucky he is, makes me wonder if he should be called the true “Tyrant King.” If there is any luck in the future due to this planning and deeds throughout each chapter, his endgame constellation might be the weakest, but someone who is a wildcard due to Dokja’s unpredictability."
64,"Sep 8, 2021",Junghyeok is sooo handsome. 
64,"Sep 8, 2021","just came from the wn, and it's really weird to see junghyeok yu instead of yu junghyook."

64,"Sep 8, 2021",Dokja do be a dead man now lol
64,"Sep 8, 2021",i bet dokja will prove he knows the future but the system will over power his speech and make it inaudible 
64,"Sep 8, 2021","dokja really went with: ""oh hi, you're late"""
64,"Sep 8, 2021", junghyeok 👰

64,"Sep 9, 2021","I understand that the MC knows everything about that world etc. but these last few chapters have been too confusing. We as readers do not know anything about all the sub-plots and the too many characters that keep popping up, but the author of this WEBTOON seems to forget that too often, lately. Too many things are thrown at us readers and none of them with enough explanation "

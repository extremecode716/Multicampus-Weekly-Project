Episode,Date,Review
34,"Dec 23, 2020","Dokja saying that this time it will be more dangerous than when he sent them running straight towards the herd of enemies doesn't sound very encouraging, huh."
34,"Dec 23, 2020","Well, damn, Dokja seemed to be a bit more manipulative this episode.  He even brought up that one scene from the first few chapters, causing Jihye to relive some of her trauma.  But its cool to see a character that isnt trying to live up to an ideal, kind of gives me somebody to relate to more."
34,"Dec 23, 2020",Dokja got to sleep on the thigh of a character from his favorite novel üëå 
34,"Dec 23, 2020",i love how complimenting the muscles just brings him closer to awakening haha
34,"Dec 23, 2020","""Your muscles are awesome."" Can confirm, works every time"
34,"Dec 26, 2020",people are calling dokja manipulative and a few chapters ago they were calling him sociopathic but bruh. Everything he's doing is for his teams survival not his own. He even gave the girl that cloak and he's trying to bring their potential out so they get stronger as a team. He's just someone that's doing whatever it takes for him and the people he cares about to survive. 
34,"Feb 10, 2021","Dokja's facial expressions are 30% looking done with everything, 30% being angry/annoyed (mainly at Junghyeok), 20% acting like a shameless asshole, and the remaining 20% just sitting there looking pretty. And I 100% love him"
34,"Dec 23, 2020",Wow Dojka your new record. Manipulating 2 people in 1 chapter
34,"Dec 23, 2020","Btw, has anyone noticed that these dudes have been tolerating the smell of blood and rotting flesh for a while now? "
34,"Dec 23, 2020","I love how the other three were looking like, 'What is this rat bastard up to now, is it scam time on a team mate??', while KDJ was complimenting LHS. Even Sangah was looking weirded out and she's the nicest of them all lmao. "
34,"Dec 24, 2020","Dokja, please gift me your copy of TWSA for Christmas so when the new year comes, I'll be prepared. "
34,"Dec 24, 2020",I love the thigh pillow train they started ü§£üíõ
34,"Dec 23, 2020","I love how simple he is, ""Nice muscles"" (introspective begins) yeah they are nice, man thats probably enough to evolve into stage 2 dont you think constellations? I mean look at these juicy pecs. "
34,"Dec 23, 2020","Dokja: If there's no more rooms, then we'll... *Puts  on sunglasses*...make room. YEAAAAAAAA"
34,"Dec 23, 2020",Hyeonseong reminds me of a puppy ‚ô°
34,"Dec 23, 2020",This webtoon is so good. Too far down the coin rabbit hole now folks
34,"Dec 23, 2020",{The constellation Webtoon Reader is upset that theres no more fast pass}
34,"Feb 10, 2021","Makes me wonder, if Gilyeong has lice, will he talk to them too?"
34,"Dec 23, 2020","Ahhh... man, I ended up seeking out the actual novel because of this lol. Take my coins you glorious madmen, take my sponsored coins. "
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Most WEBTOONs: I SHIP EM . THIS WEBTOON: I wonder how many people in totally they all will kill together
34,"Feb 10, 2021","I love Dokja's character. He's not your typical justice-over-all self sacrificing hero. He's really smart and calculated but isn't automatically classified as a nerd. He stands up for himself and won't take other people's crap, but isn't a complete jerk. It's refreshing and quite nice to find a character that doesn't just fall in line with every other protagonist. "
34,"Dec 23, 2020",Ooo potential new ally approaching? It's interesting to see how the outcomes change based on just the effect of our main character's existence too.
34,"Dec 23, 2020",I wanna know what he plans to use all his coins for... he specifically mentioned he saved enough... what is iiiiit
34,"Dec 23, 2020",That poor landlord doesn't even know he's about to be unacquainted with his teeth. I'm excited for this fight to happen!
34,"Dec 23, 2020",The Secretive Plotter constellation will gift this man 5000 coins if he keeps this up. He's a little too good at manipulation. 
34,"Jan 1, 2021",Your muscles are awesome! That‚Äôs all we ever want to hear
34,"Dec 23, 2020",This is a pay to read content now. I'm not disappointed 
34,"Dec 28, 2020",I love how there is technically two protagonists. I think might end up fighting. That would sooo cooll
34,"Dec 23, 2020","""Tonight could be even more dangerous than last night"" shit is about to go down."
34,"Dec 23, 2020",God I love this series
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Gilyeong napping on Dokja napping on Hyeonseong napping was adorable
34,"Feb 10, 2021","is it just me who misses the non-anglicized names and the honorifics? I miss seeing the ""-ssi"", ""hyung"", and their last names in front of their first names idk "
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Hyeonseong: My favourite song was green pine tree üòä   Huiwon: DiD I aSk?
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Every time I see Gilyeong my hurt just melts. He's too precious. Must protecc ü•∫
34,"Feb 10, 2021","I keep seeing comments that Dokja is too OP but if you pay attention hes not, he's playing things smart, he plans ahead. He knows what he's doing. But that does not mean he's OP. Hes a awesome guy tho!"
34,"Feb 5, 2021","i dont know why so many people try to scold dojka on his recent actions because lol he's not here to live up to the classic mc role of being good and blah blah blah, he's a real(?) dude with, what seems, a very fucked up childhood that read a novel that became reality. at the end of the day he's going to do whatever is best to achieve the final of the novel in the real world"
34,"Feb 11, 2021",its like a dating sim game but we're just tryna cheer up one guy 
34,"Feb 10, 2021","Him being the protagonist of this story makes it more interesting considering the fact that he isn't good. I mean he isn't like those guys who always finds a way without resorting to violence or without breaking any law. Hes the type of person who many of us could relate to cuz he gets greedy, he pities, he sacrifices, he gets cold hearted and mean, he gets soft, he depend on other people, he helps, he destroy, he cares, and he survives "
34,"Feb 10, 2021","Wow I didn‚Äôt expect gilyeong to have his bug friends in his hair, also his ‚Äúnice muscles‚Äù compliment üòÇ"
34,"Feb 10, 2021",‚ÄúWhat the h*ll do you know?!‚Äù What Dokja thinks: ‚ÄúLiterally everything about this world.‚Äù What he says: ‚ÄúNothing of course.‚Äù
34,"Feb 10, 2021",okay but I think the relationship between Dokja and Hyeonseong is very cute and I love seeing everytime they interact with eachother üòå
34,"Feb 10, 2021","The comments are all about how Dokja is manipulative, but he's not trying to harm anyone by doing that. In fact, they benifit from it as they grow stronger & increase their chances of living. And most importantly remember that Yoo Joonghyuk the regressor would be ""manipulating"" them& recruiting them into his party had it not been for Dokja & he does this literally every one of his regressions"
34,"Apr 8, 2021","dammit I'm way too easily swayed by humble precious himbos like Hyeonseong. just one look at their faces that scream ""I... did something good? I'm useful? I will follow you to the ends of the earth."" and I'm already tearing up "
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Hyeonseong is such a precious puppy man and I love him
34,"Feb 10, 2021","As much as Dokja was pretty manipulative and this was quite a really tense episode, my head is just full of thoughts about Gilyeong sleeping on Dokja's thigh while Dokja is sleeping on Hyeonseong's thighs."
34,"Feb 10, 2021",she compliment him by comparing him to a pine treeüòÇ
34,"Dec 23, 2020",{webtoon reader is waiting for their attribute *faster fast pass* to blossom}
34,"Dec 23, 2020",please just take my coins i dont need them
34,"Feb 15, 2021","Does anyone else think Dokja is like really hot?? No, just me? K."
34,"Feb 11, 2021",‚ÄúYour muscles are awesome‚Äù *everyone likes that*
34,"Dec 25, 2020",I kinda feel bad for Jihye... she does seem like she was kind of like Gilyeoung before all hell broke lose but she didn‚Äôt have someone like Dokja to guide her üòî
34,"May 1, 2021","‚ÄúSecretive Plotter wants to know about your mother‚Äù : So bro, your mother single orr?"
34,"Feb 10, 2021",I love how Gilyeong lets the bugs come onto his head. They‚Äôre just chilling in his hair. His skill is so cool. 
34,"Apr 7, 2021",Uwahhhh gilyeoung (dunno if i spelled that right) is sooo cute and him and dokja‚Äôs relationship is so wholesome üòñü•∞ü•∫üò≠ 
34,"Feb 11, 2021",Plot twist: we ARE the constellations
34,"Feb 11, 2021","I love how Hyenseong has become the team's Pok√©mon, they want to evolve him and everything"
34,"Feb 10, 2021","I really love Dokja as a character, many readers call dokja a manipulative person but that's not necessarily a bad attribute, considering he is doing it for the best of all of them, like I understand not many of you will call him a selfless person doing it for the greater good. At least not yet... "
34,"Mar 5, 2021","dokja is such  a well written character honestly, i love him sm, and  them trying to cheer up jonghyuk this ep was hilaroius and adorable xD huisong being like ""i didnt ask"" ahaha oh huisong,,,hyeongseong is so wholesome, poor guy looked like a sad puppy after huisong but im glad the others cheered him up"
34,"Feb 15, 2021","as far I know for celebrate dokja birthday, the fans in korea make and large ads in station at seoul and busan. even munpia, the novel publisher also celebrate dokja birthday by produce and design chocholate box with a lot of omniscient reader ornament inside it with singshong sign and price that I can't pay üòÇ and its sold out only few days. now I saw that fans in korea made cafe that design just for dokja birthday. a lot of people really love dokja right üòäüòä"
34,"Feb 11, 2021",I‚Äôm curious to see when our other girl is going to come out to complete our badass trinity 
34,"Feb 10, 2021","Ah Dokja is so cool and interesting. The way the story has built his character really draws you in whenever he does something. Also, I love Hyeonseong a lot. I'm really excited for his 'moment'."
34,"Feb 10, 2021",not them acting like gilyeongs parents aww
34,"Apr 29, 2021","Hyeonseong, you did very... WHALE üêã ü§£üòÇ "
34,"Mar 21, 2021","I love how Huiwon never trust anything Dokja is saying. Haha, she always looks like 'are u kidding me?' but in the end she'll follow along "
34,"Feb 11, 2021",she's really pretty and capable! love the bunny charm on a harmful sword LOL
34,"Feb 10, 2021","You know what's so cute, it's that Gilyeong was thinking of Dokja even in his SLEEP"

34,"Mar 29, 2021",Is it me or these four constellations are like his biggest fans?
34,"Mar 12, 2021","Bro I am blown away every time I read another chapter of this. The art style and work is beautiful and the story. Oh my lord it‚Äôs perfect, the idea of a reader knowing all but not completely abusing it. Along with that he‚Äôs realizing that the story is changing from what he knew. "
34,"Feb 12, 2021",Im just imagining that when Dokja is patting/ruffling Gilyeong's hair and then he just feels the cockroaches in Gilyeong's hair
34,"Feb 11, 2021",The guys all laying on each other was sweet. Nice they want to cheer him up. I‚Äôm curious about his trauma but it definitely looks sad. 
34,"Feb 10, 2021","#DokjaistheBestProtagonist because he is a manipulative, lying, two faced bastard. Because he is more REAL than IDEAL which is what I love about him. And the gang cheering on Hyeonseong is sooooo cute!!!!!"

34,"Jun 11, 2021","I love how real and imperfect Dokja is. I'm tired of seeing righteous, hero characters. His manipulation and ability to do whatever it takes to survive and thrive is so refreshing. You can tell he's still a good person, but he doesn't let that hinder him. It makes me able to relate to him. He's perfectly ""flawed."""

34,"Feb 11, 2021",Im curious of gilyoungs thoughts first he kept on looking at dokja and observing and he even sleep talked his name... and im so CURIOUS to know what gilyoung talked to Junghyeok about
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Gilyeong dreaming of Dokja is the most wholesome thing ever
34,"Feb 10, 2021","If you want to support the author, read the official translation of the novel this is based on at Webnovel under the same title"

He‚Äôs not trying to be a perfectly good, super brave, super smart hero that saves everyone; he‚Äôs literally just the dude who ended up living through the storyline of a book. It‚Äôs okay that he may be a little hypocritical, it‚Äôs okay that he‚Äôs a little manipulative at times, it‚Äôs okay that he‚Äôs not trying to save everyone; he‚Äôs a normal human that I can relate to and respect, and that‚Äôs what I love about him."

34,"Feb 11, 2021","I am always so excited to read these chapters. The mystery of the plot and the characters are so interesting. Thank you for creating this webtoon, creator. It gives me something to look forward to each week."
34,"Feb 11, 2021","It's nice to see Dokja trying to help Jihye heal from her trauma. PTSD is no joke, especially to a high schooler. Why do you think he's so protective of Gil. "
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Damn I didn't expect for him to wake one military dude's lap nice comedic relief üëå
34,"Feb 10, 2021",Best boi gilyeong with his cute little cockroach friends in his hair ü•∞üíï
34,"Feb 10, 2021",i‚Äôve said it before and i‚Äôm going to say it again i‚Äôm so glad that Dokja isn‚Äôt your typical protagonist the one which is like no i love people i would never harm them he understands what he need to do to survive and he does it it just gives the webtoon an overall realistic feel
34,"Dec 26, 2020","I spent all of my money for this, and it was definently worth it "
34,"Dec 23, 2020","I think Dokja's biggest weakness is his half hearted belief that his protective instincts are a negative survival trait. But the only reason we're around as a species is due to our ability to work together. The fable of the one true hero is mostly that and even in those stories there are almost always others who sacrifice themselves to get the ""Chosen One"" where they need to be.Or if if you want the sayin;
""Know one is an island.""

34,"Feb 11, 2021","I wonder if Dokja wrote this story?.... This webtoon is probably like, ‚ÄúSkeleton Soldier Couldn‚Äôt Protect The Dungeon‚Äù. Where the skeleton was the writer, but he forgot himself cuz he died.But on this book when the regressor dies. Time goes back to the beginning where only the regressor remembers everything. So, Dokja probably wrote the story but forgot everything because of the regressor rewinding time."

However, he doesn‚Äôt have a constellation like these stronger individuals, meaning he has a very good excuse as to why he‚Äôs at a disadvantage. And to think he will most likely end up being one of the strongest characters in the series (even though he signed that contract, preventing him from using a constellation) it seems pretty incredible. LOVE THIS SERIES."

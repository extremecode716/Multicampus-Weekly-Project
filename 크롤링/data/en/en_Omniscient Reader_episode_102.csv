Episode,Date,Review
102,"Apr 27, 2022","The catastrophe wondering just who the heck Kim Dokja is, is just me reacting to relatives who‚Äîapparently, watched me grow up."
102,"Apr 27, 2022",nooo titano also got turned into a donutüò≠üò≠
102,"Apr 27, 2022","it's fun to see how baby Gilyeong is growing up. He's not your ordinary crybaby, he's so mature despite of his age"
102,"Apr 27, 2022","Huh, so it looks like dokjas actions can hurt/shake the fourth wall, but it hurts dokja.  I wonder if he ‚Äúbroke the fourth wall‚Äù that would end up in his death?"
102,"Apr 27, 2022","honestly this chapter left me awestruck- I had a feeling dokja would possess the catastrophe yuseung, but having her meet her child self, sharing their memories is kind of emotional "
102,"Apr 27, 2022",OH MY GOSH!!! I wasnt expecting him to take control of HER. But all of them fighting because they love Dokja just AHHHüò≠üò≠Now she'll care about him too because of the memories of younger her right...? Interesting [no spoilers in the replies please I just wanna theorize :') ]
102,"Apr 27, 2022",Her reaction is basically that feeling when the adaption changes from the original source material.
102,"Apr 27, 2022","‚ÄúTell me who Dokja is!‚Äù while strangling Gilyeong. Gee, I wonder why he couldn‚Äôt answer you? üôÑ"
102,"Apr 27, 2022","I love these last couple chapters, how they didn't  show what Dokja was doing until he performed his most direct intervention. Then it recapped his previous interventions so we could see his journey. I love this, and want to do something like this in my writing, but It's different in the written word than a web comic."
102,"Apr 27, 2022",only thing I hate about fast pass is that I can't fast pass after all the fast passes ü•≤
102,"Apr 27, 2022",Precious children avenging their dad ‚ô•Ô∏è
102,"Apr 27, 2022","[Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" is shedding a tear for our fallen Titano. Also wonders now what will both young and old Shin will do as they have received each other's memories. 5 coins sponsored]"
102,"Apr 27, 2022",I feel so bad for her she just wanted someone to care about her üòî 
102,"Apr 30, 2022","This just makes me realize how much Dokja has accomplished along the way. How much he's influenced all the characters and how he's managed to change the storyline SO MUCH, it's almost unrecognizable. So many people love him.  Reading ORV continously, I missed all these small affection points, but now that I see, Dokja literally has a whole ARMY of (strong) people, who are not his followers (as in Junghyeok's case), but his companions (like Hyeonseong said). "
102,"Apr 27, 2022",By far my fav comic on WEBTOON no question 
102,"Apr 27, 2022","so Yueseung saw how Dokja saved her younger self,  unlike Junyeok did for her"
102,"Apr 27, 2022","R.I.P. Titano, you will not be forgottenüò≠üò≠"
102,"Apr 27, 2022","""Where is Dokja!?"" THIS REALLY IS ODD FOR ME. I NEED THE ""Dokja-hyung"" !"
102,"Apr 27, 2022","Omg, Dokja's stare with the glowing eye near the beginning gave me chills! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
102,"Apr 27, 2022",wait..... is the catastrophes past being overwritten? are the films connecting? or are they just sharing memories? this is so interesting
102,"Apr 27, 2022","41st shin yoosung's thoughts left bawling yk. if i too were in her shoes ain't no way i'd be sane. yeah, maybe she should've only killed yoo joonghyuk and not the others as well, but as i stated before, no way my mind would still be able to think rational. i'm not saying she was right for going crazy and killed everyone, but i can see where it's coming from"
102,"Apr 27, 2022",The reader is now controlling the characters~
102,"Apr 27, 2022",I love all these characters and the growth they‚Äôve all made and the bond they all share nowüò≠üò≠
102,"Apr 27, 2022",She seems to like making doughnuts...
102,"Apr 27, 2022",who is dokja you ask? well he's the new Mc didn't you know?
102,"Apr 27, 2022",Leaving us blue balled like this should be illegal
102,"Apr 28, 2022",This crazy build-up is exactly why this has to be my favorite thing to read on here. Simply amazing.
102,"Apr 27, 2022",I am feeling Dokja pain and how much a story like this means to people. I am about to be evicted [I hope not] from my place of residence. I feel the need for this story. Thank you for this amazing read.
102,"Apr 27, 2022","this has rapidly become my favorite read, it has amazing characters, funny Constilations, I love the dynamic between him and his dokebi I forget how to spell forgive me, he plays everyone and it's freaking amazing how well it's being put together. thank you üôè "
102,"Apr 27, 2022","This episode and the last one are some of my favorite pieces of storytelling ever. I already am so invested in this story, and so far we've rarely seen things that are a death threat to the entire cast. The two other catastrophes Dokja fought were very powerful (the dragon and the question guy), but Dokja mostly fought those alone or with a couple allies. This is a threat that completely trumps everything else, and the writing completely sells it. I'm the previous powerful fights, we've seen..."
102,"Apr 27, 2022",I love when dokja gets to play god mode omg
102,"Jun 1, 2022",I HATE THAT THEY DROPPED HONORIFICS IN THE TRANSLATION üò≠ He was supposed to say Dokja Hyung!! It‚Äôs so much more meaningful that way üò≠üò≠
102,"Jun 1, 2022",Everyone asking about Dokja and fighting for him instead of Junghyeok must've truly messed up Yuseung. Seeing that everyone's following a different person than the one she thought... and now knowing that he saved her in this timeline... Idk what'll happen to her but I feel bad for Catastrophe Yuseung
102,"Apr 27, 2022",alright this is as far as i can go. no more fastpass next week. i'm running out of coins.
102,"Apr 27, 2022",It's incredible how emotionally charged the author was able to make this episode. Full of suspense and admiration for Dokja from his companions! What an incredible Webtoon.
102,"May 2, 2022",I love when we get to see from an outside perspective. how the protagonist has affected the world. and seeing her struggling and asking who he is is she seeing a completely different world from her own is amazing.
102,"Apr 28, 2022",dude wtf man this series is just wow
102,"May 3, 2022",I can't believe the homie Titano got the Rengoku treatment. Rip to the OG. 
102,"Apr 28, 2022",Man.. Gilyeong face when he was asking bout Dokja.... He's got all my sympathys this week. Just like he lost his closest friend or even a member of his family. And Yueseung expression when Dokja starts to mess with her... Damn!! This is priceless. I hope now that damn catastrophe will get how big is Dokja's role in this round 
102,"Apr 27, 2022",This is top notch writing! holy shit!
102,"Jun 1, 2022",I still really feel for Yuseung... Junghyeok treated her like trash and deserved to be beat up :/ But I'm glad Dokja could get a handle on her before she killed his party members.
102,"Apr 27, 2022",the art was incredible. The production team is doing a phenomenal job
102,"Jun 1, 2022","I have a kind of unsubstantiated theory that the author of the novel in the story is some future version of Junyeok who wrote it all down in hopes of getting someone else to read it and essentially become the new main character, someone who could change the fated incarnations he lived through and maybe succeed in a better way than he did. The theory isn't really supported by anything (it's hard to imagine a future Junyeok who cares about others) but it wouldn't seem out of place either "
102,"Jun 1, 2022",I feel sorry for everyone who have to read the 'Mister' instead of the iconic'Ajusshi'
102,"Apr 28, 2022",I am worried about what that plausibility storm is going to do to Dokja's soul :(. 
102,"Jun 1, 2022",And to think this random kid with a bug box at the metro had this potential.
102,"Jun 2, 2022",bro telling his daughter to behave
102,"Jun 1, 2022","I swear this is so well written. There are so many characters and storylines, and they are well mapped. I remember all the characters since the beginning, and that's not easy when I'm doing weekly releases. Dokja is far from perfect or moral, but who wouldn't take advantage of a world like this in his shoes. I just wanna know, when's he going to get back in his body!"
102,"May 3, 2022",I don't think I've ever read a comic before that's brought me to the brink of tears like this one has .I can't wait for the next episode
102,"Jun 1, 2022",It gets harder and harder to not just look up and binge the original novel
102,"Jun 1, 2022",this needs to be an anime it would be awesome
102,"Jun 1, 2022",Well this is a new concept of mindfuck
102,"Jun 1, 2022",Holy shit the author and artists are incredible
102,"Jun 1, 2022","So, since the catastrophe killed Dokja, does that mean her little girl variant won all those scam bitcoins offered for his head?"
102,"Apr 28, 2022",that one panel of just Kim dokja's eye... *Megalovania plays distantly*
102,"Apr 28, 2022",The Disconnect Theory has commenced. Please wait paitently for the film to load. ETA One Week
102,"Apr 27, 2022",Seeing all of them risk everything for dokja is giving me life right now üò≠üò≠
102,"Jun 2, 2022","The moment Yuseung says ""Mister,"" I still read it as Ahjussi, like it is was the original. That was one of the big moments in the novel--you could feel the tension and almost stoppage in time moment as she realizes Dokja is controlling future Yuseung. Very moving."
102,"Apr 27, 2022","Man, that donut beam attack of hers is nuts. "
102,"Apr 27, 2022","With this, their lives now intersect. Jesus Kim, what the hell will happen now at the end of this scenario?"
102,"Jun 1, 2022","if anyone, anytime tells me this isn't pure art. I'll fight "
102,"Jun 1, 2022","Dokja is having a HUGE main character moment right now though..being the leader of most of the characters who should have gotten used and thrown away, taking over the big scary catastrophe, influencing every character to fight for him and avenge his death..I feel bad for this catastrophe. She went through much pain just to see the next world her is safe and nothing she saw will happen again, that has to sting so bad..Everyone she knew is different because of some ‚Äúnobody‚Äù..&she wont get revenge."
102,"Jun 1, 2022",Oh no does that mean her kid version has to remember everything that happened to her too?
102,"Jun 1, 2022","the catastrophe be like: ""who's this Dokja bitch you'll talking about???"""
102,"Apr 28, 2022",damn it why did they even make fast pass a thing üò≠ I'm gonna have to take out a second mortgage
102,"Apr 27, 2022",so that's where Antinus dies. seems she was a completely useless character after all
102,"Jun 2, 2022",idk if its just me but i felt shivers down my spine reading it. 
102,"Jun 2, 2022",The power of Dokja's influence is loyalty ‚ú® and traumaüóø....
102,"Jun 1, 2022",AWWW SHE MISSES HIM- THAT HIT ME RIGHT IN THE GUT HOLY SHIT
102,"Jun 1, 2022",i just love how the catastrophe asked who is dokja kim? and then they show his face. and then the title! and then just everything. i loved everything here.
102,"Jun 1, 2022",cryinf screaming rolling on the floor
102,"Jun 1, 2022",*Dokja after Yuseung keeps trying to murder his friends*: You(almost) took everything from me] Yuseung: I dont even know who you are
102,"Apr 27, 2022",hey guys for the online translation for this chapter page 4 the 5th catastrophe calls junyeok a fucking scum instead of a bastard. I think the online translation do a bit of a better job than webtoons cause you can realise how big of an asshole junyeok really is in the online translation than the webtoon translation but the reading experience on webtoons is the best of any apps or websites as there are adds online and that can I think just make the reading experience a bit worse. 
102,"Jun 2, 2022","Would it be strange to say that I understand her more as well? She got nothing out of what she did, and now she only has her revenge. Without that what else would she have?"
102,"Jun 2, 2022","Olympus and‚Ä¶ A GIANT PRAYING MANTIS WITH A KID

I just loved how dramatic Olympus should have sounded, but was nothing compared to our baby and his pet."
102,"Jun 1, 2022","I honestly thought this was a short episode, but no. it's just really intense. getting real engrossed in this chapter."
102,"Jun 1, 2022","Loved when Yuseung immediately recognized it was Dokja. And of course he would go through that pain multiple times to save the others... Also, can't wait to see how everyone reacts when Dokja resurrects"
102,"Jun 1, 2022","Man... the art for this Webtoon is so damned good. I love how Future-Yeseung is just super confused, and everyone else is just concerned about Dokja."
102,"Jun 1, 2022",You are special. You are loved.
102,"May 4, 2022",At this point I'm scared to stop reading thisüòÇyou never know.....

102,"Jun 2, 2022",oh snap their timelines combined since they touched. Now the current catastrophe might not kill everybody cuz she doesn't have the same past

102,"Apr 27, 2022",Part of me is surprised Dojka‚Äôs plan didn‚Äôt think about possessing the catastrophe given that it‚Äôs just grown up Shin Yueseung (which he knew she would become a catastrophe). I wonder what his original plan was now

102,"Jun 1, 2022",What if‚Ä¶ dokja is the author from the future???
102,"Jun 1, 2022","the funny thing is that he was doubting himself, jealous of the protagonist and now he gets concrete proof he changed the lives of all those people. i love power fantasies, we don't get to break the 4th wall on our own lives and see our actions from the outside"
102,"Jun 1, 2022",waiting patiently for the next chapter to see what convoluted nonsense Dokja comes up with to try an convince himself no one cares about him üòê‚ùó‚ùó

102,"Jun 1, 2022",Did no one guessed that Dokja was going to take over adult Yuseung? Cause like she literally kept thinking about who he is and thinking about him is what he needs to take over a person. Clearly she is a better choice than Gilyeong.
102,"Jun 1, 2022","The art here is so beautiful.

102,"Jun 1, 2022",The picture of Dokja right before the title card gave me *chills*
102,"Jun 1, 2022",DOKJA IS SO FINE BRO OMLLL
102,"Jun 1, 2022",might just be the most impressive chapter yet
102,"Jun 1, 2022",damnn it's lowkey satisfying being the tc. i love lee gilyoung.
102,"Jun 1, 2022","I was shrieking throughout the whole chapter. I love it. And the scene 'why do I miss him' made me cry, although I have not read the novel. "
102,"Jun 1, 2022",FCK THIS IS SO GOOD I'VE BEEN ABOUT TO CRY FROM EXCITEMENT THE WHOLE TIME
102,"Jun 1, 2022",literal chills in this chapterüòÜ
102,"Jun 1, 2022","I love this arc!!!! It‚Äôs so emotional watching the turmoil between future yoosung and past yoosung, seeing how dokja‚Äôs presence has already deeply rooted itself in past yoosung, that it‚Äôs even become a core memory for future one!"
102,"Jun 1, 2022",All the rage of every character in this chapter made me shed tears...
102,"Jun 1, 2022",I think the power of plausibility is about to have a mind f***. What will happens when two of the same person from different timeline touch each other is anybody guesses.
102,"Jun 1, 2022","Just how much Dokja has changed the story, by having everyone meet him first before the real protag. That just shows how much this ""route"" he's taking matters."
102,"Jun 1, 2022","this episode was adapted so well man, it's so cool to see how many people kim dokja has gathered by his side but also heartbreaking for the 41st yuseong "

102,"Jun 1, 2022",they really need to keep the honorification in the translation. it make the dialogue more powerful n story more impactfull. like gilyoung calling dokja hyung or yuseung calling him ahjushi coz it show level of their trust n respect to character.
102,"Jun 1, 2022","""Why do I miss him?"" is the hardest hitting line in this episode imo. I can't describe it but I think it really describes how she's feeling in this situation."
102,"Jun 1, 2022","""why does it feel like i miss him?"" Im tearing upüò≠üò≠"

102,"Jun 11, 2022",My appreciation for Kim Dadja continues to climb. 
102,"Jun 10, 2022",I thought he was going to posses small Yuseung. Never crossed my mind that he would control the catastrophe. His skills are really elite. And the sharing of their memories was genius! I feel bad for older Yuseung. She‚Äôs just hurt that Junghyeok never considered her a companion after all the sacrifices she made for him
102,"Jun 9, 2022",i literally had goosbumps reading this episode üò≠
102,"Jun 9, 2022",Omg I had an inkling that he was going to end up possessing the catastrophe but it‚Äôs still so much better than I ever could have imagined

102,"Jun 8, 2022","Oh, the people who theorized about Dokja possessing the adult Yuseong were right. That's very interesting. But it would have been so unexpected if he possessed Suyeon xD like ""WHY THE HELL IS SHE THINKING ABOUT ME?! WHERE IS SHE?! WHAT DO I DO NOW?!"""
102,"Jun 3, 2022",My god.. that was a rush

102,"Jun 1, 2022","This was a fantastic chapter. excellent job. There's a sense for me that the true strength of the reader is from understanding and empathizing with the characters, they become real to you. This is so much more interesting than Dokja just knowing some weakness of hers from the story and expoliting it."
102,"Jun 1, 2022",awesome

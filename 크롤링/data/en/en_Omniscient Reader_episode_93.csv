Episode,Date,Review
93,"Feb 23, 2022","I need them to stop acting like dokja isn't a total hottie. he's a single father to like 2 children now and he's strong and smart , what's missing??? also I'm excited for secretive plotter lore [leaky faucet donates 5 coins] (ty for top but also some spoilers in replies)"
93,"Feb 23, 2022",Anybody gonna talk about how he said she's a corpse?
93,"Feb 23, 2022",I definitely think Secretive Plotter is the writer of TWAS No CAP
93,"Feb 23, 2022","""You're ugly."" This is why I love the Dokja-Suyeong dynamic."
93,"Feb 23, 2022",Lmao. That panel with the nostrils icant TT 
93,"Feb 23, 2022","“She is my incarnate that I’ve raised!” Oh Dokja we all know you mean to say adopted child, just admit it already."
93,"Feb 23, 2022",Who wants to bet this is just her avatar skill
93,"Feb 23, 2022","Am I the only one that thinks he's actually handsome...? Like I think he's pretty good looking and I quite like him, maybe it's because he alao has a good personality imo and reads webnovels and stuff but I think he's handsome. Also is that one of her like copy things??? I hope she isn't actually dead😭😭😭"
93,"Feb 26, 2022",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' finds it funny that the incarnation KDJ is so conscious of of its appearance.][The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' is advising to accept the truth. ][5 coins have been sponsored. ]
93,"Feb 23, 2022",Can I just say… I miss you LAZY BROKE WEEB 😭
93,"Feb 23, 2022","if Dokja is ugly, we don't have a chance"
93,"Feb 23, 2022","her being dead would explain all the honesty she gave through this episode, as compared to how secretive she's been. it also hasn't seemed through the last couple episodes that she's been hunting like Dokja has to get coins, and she mentions in this episode she hasn't been getting as many from the constellations. i think she ran out of coins, couldn't pay the survival fee and stopped wanting to continue on, so gave Dokja her story and let herself pass."
93,"Feb 23, 2022","""I chose you over seoul. And I don't regret doing so at all."" I'm happy that they keep this quote 😭 I thought it got cut "
93,"Feb 23, 2022",AAAHHH LMAOO IT'S THE SELFIE PANEL. I REALLY CANT
93,"Feb 23, 2022",Dokja is like an A1 homeless shelter for those who need him….. he’s literally the best I’m so glad a series has made Him into Such an amazing And resourceful character
93,"Feb 23, 2022","My bet was for Secretive Plotter to be Dokja from the future when he becomes a constellation; but, I like Neptune’s theory about it being the author too :) "
93,"Mar 30, 2022","lmao dokja really thinks his DAUGHTER, who he SPONSORED, would leave him for some handsome man with the personality of an on-fire onion hgfgfghjhghcf dokja dokja my buddy my pal not everyone is as affected as you not everyone is gushing about his eyebrows seemingly drawn by a single, uninterrupted stroke of a famed artist's brush; a nose and a chin shaped in perfect angles that defied attempts to measure them through mere devices of men; a pair of deep eyes seemingly carved out of a beautiful je"
93,"Feb 23, 2022",The panel where is Yuseung admiring Jung-Hyeok. I imagine Dokja kinda have same reactions when he red ways of survival 😂
93,"Feb 23, 2022","NOOOOO NO NO, PLEASE DON’T DIE"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","""Man, even though she's annoying, I'm glad to have her accompany me."" *dies*"
93,"Feb 23, 2022",I'm sure Sooyoung can one-shot my heart with that knife ♡
93,"Feb 23, 2022",She can’t be dead. I will not accept this outcome
93,"Mar 23, 2022",“you’re ugly” Dokja and Suyeong have a sibling relationship
93,"Feb 23, 2022",and I was just beginning to like suyeong.
93,"Feb 23, 2022",aww look how cute dokja taking selfie 😭💕
93,"Feb 23, 2022","*Pulls out the B*tch radar*shows nothing
""Either she really is dead or she knows this thing works with a 10m radius"""
93,"Feb 23, 2022",Dokja the sugar daddy all the way ✊🏻
93,"Feb 23, 2022",The comment about not getting as much coins as she used to might be a clue to what happened. 
93,"Feb 23, 2022","Honestly, I’m straight but I don’t think Dokja looks that bad, either. I agree with his assessment in the flashback lol.
Also, the lady wasn’t ugly, either."
93,"Feb 23, 2022",Dokja…… am I goood looking….. lmao🤣
93,"Mar 23, 2022","Junghyeok is very handsome, but Dokja is not ugly as the other characters say :( "
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Dokja is like a divorced mom who doesn't want their kid to like their dad more 😆
Also what do you mean corpse??"
93,"Feb 23, 2022",Dokja you marvellously petty creature. I know your insecurity over your appearance is a plot point. But flaming skies - that expression when thinking about Shin Yuseong abandoning you for YJH over that... I shouldn't laugh. But I did.
93,"Mar 30, 2022","""She is my incarnation that I raised"" you just met her but fine. Not Dokja being an overprotective parent"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",The kids don't even need the lie detection skill to read dokja wkbssldblsdo just watch his nostril and you'll know if the rats lying or not
93,"Feb 23, 2022",NOOOOO SUYEONG
93,"Mar 30, 2022",the junghyeok in kdj's mind is always so hot for some reason 
93,"Feb 23, 2022",😤I love the chapter as a whole but that ENDING😤
93,"Feb 23, 2022",I actually felt something in that last panel. Didn't think I cared about her. In a different sense it feels kind of right on time and deepens the plot. Hard to put my finger on it though. Well done author.
93,"Feb 23, 2022","[Constellation Dragon of the Peach Tree hopes Lee Hyunsong is alright, but alas shocked to see Sooyoung dead!]"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","As a person who’s read the entire novel, seeing all these WEBTOON only people making theories is so adorable. You guys are so cute! "
93,"Mar 23, 2022","Dokja completes his fable and becomes a constellation that transcends time seemingly, writes TWSA, gives it to himself in this dimension since ya know he transcends time, and bam he’s Secretive Plotter… many holes in it but I like my idea"
93,"Feb 23, 2022",Que Danganronpa body discovery announcement 
93,"Feb 24, 2022",That kinda upset me. I liked her.
93,"Feb 23, 2022",Lol Ugliest King
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Also one thing that I dislike about English translation removing the honorifics is that we don't get to see the relationship dynamics the characters originally had. Like in this, Yuseung calls Dokja with 'ahjussi' which is how you call a middle aged man who's not your relative, while she calls Junghyeok with 'oppa' which is how a girl calls her older brother, despite both men being the same age 🤣"
93,"Mar 13, 2022","sooyoung to dokja: I want to ask you one thing dokja: you are ugly 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
still this conversation running on my mind 🤣🤣🤣🤣I can't stop laughing 🤭😆"
93,"Feb 23, 2022","Is she tricking him, or did she not meet one of the clear conditions? She mentioned getting less coins, but no way that she wouldn't have even 500 coins... right? 👀"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Dokja calling Suyeong ugly before she even asked her question is best friend level relationship
93,"Mar 27, 2022","lol I love suyeong and dokja interactions... Their relationship have grown sm and they are now open with each other,can talk ,roast , understand and speak their mind unhesitatingly ..I wonder if suyeong is the author or ? I don't think she is that weak to die that easily and it's been told that she is one of the protagonists?"
93,"Mar 23, 2022",Wrf? I actually loved that character and thought she had huge potential 
93,"Feb 23, 2022",holy shit things just went 0-100 real quick and here i was starting to enjoy suyeong more
93,"Mar 30, 2022",WDYM CORPSE
93,"Mar 30, 2022","""But I probably have more coins than most historical constellations"" this is like the bourgeoisie and the royalty during the industrial revolution, for reals he's powerful"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",If Sooyoung is actually dead I might just cry
93,"Mar 30, 2022","after finishing the novel, the conversation of Dokja and Han Suyeong hits different "
93,"Mar 16, 2022","Did sooyoung die because they slept at the same time? Violating the taking turns sleeping part in their contract? Cause he tells sooyoung to go to sleep first, then falls asleep immediately after...🤔"
93,"Feb 23, 2022","As others have said, I'm not seeing his homely looks. Weird that the artist mad him handsome and fashionable but his author ego made him ugly. Weird play there."
93,"Apr 1, 2022","Huh, kim dokja as a husky. Something I never realized I needed in my life edit: I should call him Kim dogja now huh"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Kim Dokja: Not everyone is going to think I’m pretty and that’s okay. //Me: Yeah blind people do exist!
93,"Feb 27, 2022","I thought he had a fable?  Even went back to reread, he got a fable when he destroyed the throne: ""King of a World Without kings"""
93,"Feb 23, 2022",wonder if it's another clone situation or if she really died
93,"Mar 30, 2022","There’s no way Suyeong’s dead… she’s far too smart for that. By the way… why did Dokja fall asleep that quickly??? Was he roofied??? Wait… the flower stem they eat… didn’t he say if they don’t drink the boiled juice first, that it drugs them into falling asleep? And only the party would know that, because Dokja told them… *GASP!* it was HER!! But I thought that she signed a contract with Dokja not to betray him otherwise she’d… die… huh… wait a minute!!!…"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","everyone: ""I don't know how everyone says he's unattractive 🙄🤚"". Novel readers: ""👁👄👁, *whispers* I know"""
93,"Mar 30, 2022","I don't see what everyone else in the story sees, because I think Dokja is very handsome, so am I missing something..???"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",You are special. You are loved.
93,"Mar 23, 2022","Give Suyeong backstory and more depth to the character and kill her off, i hope she is still alive or maybe that was a clone."
93,"Mar 18, 2022","i just became supporting constellation, author, here's your 5 coins"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","MC' EXCUSE ME? DID YOU JUST SAY  C O R P S E ?
NO NUH UH YOU DID NOT. NOPE. NO."
93,"Apr 2, 2022","these men are delusional, kim dokja is the epitome of beauty!!! he is a feral man with a tiny waist and a great fashiom sense!!!"
93,"Apr 1, 2022",WTF. DOKJA BECAME A FUCKING DOG
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Im starting to think Han Sooyoung is the author of TWSA and wrote it when she was younger and the story she was about to tell that dokja interrupted and finished for her might actually have some truth to it she could very well have given up on her dreams and TWSA because maybe fewer people started to read it and that broke her mentally also writers use aliases it's possible she used one well writing TWSA and over time she just forgot then she started having dreams which caused her to write again
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Dang I didn't realise I missed secretive plotter so much
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Please don't be dead🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️, you make things interesting."
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Dokja is handsome as hell! Sure he may not have Junghyok’s jawline, nor his long flowing hair, but he’s still quite a looker. If Junghyok is a 10/10, then I’d say Dokja is at least a 9/10."
93,"Mar 30, 2022",gasp. suyeong didn't plagiarize. good twist
93,"Mar 30, 2022","""[A constellation who love to flirt looks at you pitifully.]"" ouch hahahaha"
93,"Feb 26, 2022",Dokja doesn’t look ugly tho.
93,"Mar 23, 2022",BUT HES SO HANDSOME HOW CAN YOU NOT LIKE THAT FACE 
93,"Apr 1, 2022","MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE DOKJA A RAT, WEBTOON STAFF. SMH"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",this is a time loop themed manhwa so everything is possible to happen😏
93,"Mar 30, 2022","as someone who already finished reading the novel, i just cry every time i read the manhwa i missed them ㅠㅠ"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",no one taliking about HSY confirming that she didn't plagiarize TWSA
93,"Mar 30, 2022",is it just me or does anyone else think secretive plotter is actually dokja?
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Aww teenage Dokja taking bathroom selfies haha.
93,"Feb 27, 2022",I actually hope she isn't dead. She is actually a good character. I wonder how Gilyeong is doing though.
93,"Feb 25, 2022",is she dead dead? or is it one of her bodies? 
93,"Feb 24, 2022",Ladies and gentlemen... Dokja Cat
93,"Feb 23, 2022","What!? Hey, I liked her, don't kill her off"
93,"Mar 31, 2022",HOW DO PEOPLE CALL HIM UGLY 😭
93,"Mar 31, 2022","❌spoiler comment❌: This so far has been a prettey good adaptation from the novel, one of the best novel to webtoon adaptation I've seen really, but I have a pet peeve, and I am aware I'm nitpicking. Why is younger Dokja so BIG, like current Dokja and younger dokja are the same size. In the novel it says that teenage Dokja could be confused for an elementary schooler, he wasshort and underfed so where is that here?"
93,"Mar 31, 2022",The reason she died was because Dokja called her ugly 😢
93,"Mar 30, 2022","A constellation who loves to Flirt looks at you Pitifully Bahahahahahah, That was Savage!"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",haha don't worry dokja yoosung wouldn't hate you even if you turn into a ugly squid or something 🤣
93,"Mar 30, 2022","I was so used to having Suyeong as Dokja's current closest companion I totally forgot about Huiwon, which used to one be the closest, until Dokja reminisced about her comments on his looks.
(also I started to like Suyeong a lot, thinking she kinda counterbalances Dokja with her sharp comments, and liked her more and more each chapter I see her. So the last panel had me frozen a few seconds)"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","the panel of shin yoosung with the coins is absolutely gorgeous and i'm so jealous because even at the young age of 11, she looks way cooler than me. also, the panel with sooyoung confirming the truth. and the one with salaryman dokja and apocalypse dokja. actually all the panels, i cant choose. all the art is just gorgeous <3333"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Hate to break it to you Dokja, but... your reality literally is a book... and I'm reading it... and your the main character. So... that's fun.
[The constellation Raspberry lord who has no money takes pity on your impending existential crisis]
[if the constellation Raspberry lord who has no money had money they would probably donate at least 5 coins]"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",I will stand by this dokja is handsome I don't care what anyone says
93,"Mar 23, 2022",yo if she dead I'd actually be mad she's one of my favorites
93,"Feb 25, 2022","Dokjas right to suspect Secretive Plotters actions here. Their messages have-more recently but also a bit before-stood out from other constellations, plus the almost sugar daddy levels of sponsorship. Also, loving these theories about sp cropping up, keep them coming"
93,"Feb 23, 2022","Oh no, don’t tell me she ran out of coins…."
93,"Apr 6, 2022",He’s so actually so good looking though 😧😧 
93,"Apr 4, 2022",I almost cried at that last panel. 
93,"Apr 4, 2022",I have no coins! I am now cursed to only read one episode per week! 
93,"Apr 2, 2022","Kim Dokja: APRIL FOOLS!!! //Lee Hyunsung: *looks around frantically* //
Jung Huiwon: ...what did you do? //
Kim Dokja: Nothing. I'm the joke. //
Jung Huiwon: Ooookay… //
*loud crash from the kitchen, followed by cursing*"
93,"Apr 2, 2022",lol for April fools everyone is an animal
93,"Apr 1, 2022",she would not die that easily 
93,"Apr 1, 2022",Dokja as a husky not bad! Husky is actually one of my favorite dog breed! 😆🤣
93,"Apr 1, 2022","Han Sooyoung: Today's April fools and my birthday, which means I have every right to have fun and annoy the shit out of everyone with no restraint."
93,"Mar 31, 2022","Love seeing the constellations teasing dokja all over again! one of the funniest parts of the novel, imo. Also, I love how quickly he attached himself to yuseung again lmao. You're a dad you crazy, masochistic reader, just admit it already"
93,"Mar 31, 2022",being a novel reader is fun but also not fun. fun cuz i won’t panick at situations like this. not fun cuz the novel is in more detailed so the sad scenes r xtra sad. it’s also fun seeing all the theories on who sp actually is 
93,"Mar 31, 2022","I'm a prophet, I've read the whole novel and can tell you that the secretive plotter is [REDACTED] Also, I can tell you that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] will [REDACTED] and then [REDACTED]. No need to thank me 3:) "
93,"Mar 31, 2022",how much you wanna bet she never slept
93,"Mar 31, 2022","Well, that escalated quickly.."
93,"Mar 31, 2022","Chances are, this was never her true body, but a copy like before."
93,"Mar 30, 2022",[a constellation who loves to flirt looks at you pitifully] lmao
93,"Mar 30, 2022",I think secretive plotter is the author of twsa but further I think Secretive Plotter is Dokja…. Just a thought
93,"Mar 30, 2022","redice how dare you gave us the mad, 51, and 49 both in one chapter 🙂 seriously the amount of foreshadows in this chapter is insane"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",that better be her clone because im not mentally prepared enough for this shit
93,"Mar 30, 2022",pffffft do corpses snore?
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Okay, someone out there is definitely putting Dokja to sleep, and the same person is probably the one who killed Suyeong. Right now I'm thinking mainly about two options; The little girl, because at no point before she arrived was Dokja having trouble staying awake, plus she might have killed Suyeong because it was largely obvious that she didn't agree with Dokja's plan to keep her alive. Second is someone who knows about TWSA, because prior to her death, Suyeong had mentioned something that-"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Brooo she didn’t have enough money 
93,"Mar 30, 2022",LMAO Dokja with a flip phone. 
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Uhhh I disagree heavily with killing off Dokja’s one comfort 
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Suyeong NOOO, bring her back! Bring her back right now! No, my favorite character!"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","""How good-looking do you think I am?"" you do remember who you're asking, right? And the fact that she just woke up and is in a bad mood"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Wait that might be one of her avatars because when they first met she had different avatars before they could actually meet her fr, fr, so that might be an avatar and she might still be living. :0"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",My waifu??? :(
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Omg she didn't sleep the whole night and faced the death penalty because of it
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Oh god, she’s dead !?!"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Wait did she forget to sleep 6 hours/eat meals/run out of coins because Dokja got them all… why is she dead when they were just starting to “get along”
93,"Mar 30, 2022",He’s a little protective of his new child 👀
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Criminal to finally make her relatable then off her
93,"Mar 25, 2022","hsy and kdj, 2 pretty besties 😔"
93,"Mar 18, 2022",Is suyeong out of coins? :((( I'm so sad... I've started to become fond of her lately :'(
93,"Feb 23, 2022",Awww Hyeonseong holding his shield waiting for Dokja. 🥲
93,"Feb 23, 2022",YOU'RE NOT UGLY KIM DOKJA. YOU'RE THE EPITOME OF BEAUTIFUL. I'LL CUT DOWN ANYONE WHO SAYS SO
93,"May 30, 2022",DOKJA IS THE HOTTEST MAN KNOWN TO MANKIND IDK WHAT UR SAYING YJH IS HOT BUT NOT AS MUCH AS HIM?????
93,"Apr 5, 2022",MINOR WEBNOVEL SPOILERS: i saw this explained on Reddit but it’s implied that dokja’s face is censored due to the fourth wall ability so people either see his face as blurred or distorted and assume he’s ugly i guess :/
93,"Apr 4, 2022",dokja and sooyoung chatting is damn funny
93,"Apr 4, 2022",DUDE SHE BETTER NOT BE DEAD AFTER THAT TOUCHING kind of CONVERSATION
93,"Apr 3, 2022",The bots are becoming more aggressive that it's kind of scary lmao
93,"Apr 3, 2022","Cheesy as Pie do you just live in the ORV comments?? you're everywhere lol 😂 and as for my hunch on who Secretive Plotter is...

I have high stakes in it being either KDJ and HSY. There are have been way too many things that KDJ has said that's alluded to him being some form of constellation, especially him sponsoring SYS. For HSY, the way that Secretive Plotter 'acts' seems way to lax and lazy yet also attentive in the way that HSY is. and the fact that none of the other constellations know-"
93,"Apr 2, 2022",I'm sorry but Junghyeok and Dokja have the exact same face. They're equally attractive bc they look the SAME!!!
93,"Apr 2, 2022",Since she didn’t copy twas and just wrote her dreams is it possible she’s actually a prophet or something like that without knowing?
93,"Apr 1, 2022","NOOOOOOOOOOO I LIKED HER
she was an asshole but in an interesting way. I like characters like her. It’s more boring without her around"
93,"Apr 1, 2022",She did not really died right? 
93,"Apr 1, 2022","I like suyeong, hope she's not dead"
93,"Apr 1, 2022","that ""A CONTELLATION WHO LOVES TO FLIRT LOOKS AT YOU PITIFULLY "" 🤣🤣🤣"

93,"Apr 1, 2022","brooo it would be so sad if she's actually dead. After he acknowledged the comfort it gave him too, and I can very much relate to that. she's also such a fun character to follow"
93,"Apr 1, 2022",w a t .
93,"Apr 1, 2022",the webtoon thumbnail of dogkja-
93,"Mar 31, 2022","I've been keeping an eye on secretive plotter the whole time, based on the name I assumed they'd be important  so now to see attention being brought to them is intriguing, im excited to see what happens with that."
93,"Mar 31, 2022",SHE BECAME A W H A T
93,"Mar 31, 2022",I kinda have a theory about the Secretive Plotter. My guess is that the future version of Dokja wrote TWSA for his past self because he was able to read it for 10years and possibly memorized it. The Secretive Plotter could also be THE constellation king who has an alt account to watch incarnations. But that's all I got since this chapter has been very eye-opening. Thanks for the amazing episode authors and translator-nims 💖💖💫💫😄
93,"Mar 31, 2022",I think the reason he isn’t “handsome” to the others has to do with his reading ability. Because he can be in the world and read the world I think his features are not clear like the others. 
93,"Mar 31, 2022","""You're ugly"" 💀💀"
93,"Mar 31, 2022","Yeah no, I don't accept it, she no dead, no. "
93,"Mar 30, 2022","the writer be like: ""She knew too much"" *kills her to make more drama* 🤣🤣"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Maybe dokja looks handsome in this art style, but if their eyes it looks below average "
93,"Mar 30, 2022",wait. what?
93,"Mar 30, 2022",imsorry WHAT.
93,"Mar 30, 2022",yeah no way the best chaeacter just died like that
93,"Mar 30, 2022",what does it mean when han suyeong said that maybe her own existence is plagiarize ? I 
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Sangha says she is not into a religion and then she pray to the gods of olympus........yeah, right"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",ᴄᴏʀᴘsᴇ?? ᴏʜ sʜɪᴛ
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Is prisoner of the golden headband supposed to be sun wukong?
93,"Mar 30, 2022",NAURRR AND SO IT BEGINS: KDJ BEING DRAGGED FOR HIS LOOKS
93,"Mar 30, 2022",How can people not think his face is good looking ??
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Betting now that the secretive plotter is Dokja but like not really. Idek I haven’t thought this through 😭
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Did she fail to meet a condition? it's not like there was blood..
93,"Mar 30, 2022","I was gonna say I ship Dokja and Suyeong cause they can really talk to each other about being in a fictional world, but that's necrophilia as of the last panel lol"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",she didnt sleep six hours in the night probably...and the penalty is death
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Dokja fell asleep twice with seemingly no reason. The second time, Suyeong ""died"" (I'm pretty sure she isn't dead, or at least can be revived. As someone mentioned, could be one of her clones). I think someone is purposely putting him to sleep to do what they want. Without being seen, I thought of a constellation but it seems far fetched. Maybe someone who can turn invisible? But why kill Suyeong? A constellation or Dokkaebi who doesn't want the audiance to know about TWSA could make sense..."
93,"Mar 30, 2022",SHE'S DEAD????NO.NO.NO.NO I CAN'T AND WILL NOT ACCEPT THAT. THEY JUST A DEEP CONVO AND THEN SHE'S DEAD???
93,"Mar 30, 2022","my theory since the beginning is that dokja in the future will become a constellation, secretive plotter actually, and he will rewrite TWSA in the same way he read it when he was younger, to recreate the exact past he lived in order to make his past self achieve the future he is in, in some sort of big time loop. Since i guess that, with him becoming a constellation, he can actually transcend time or something (maybe regress??)"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Wow Dokja is so insecure he tells her that he chose her over saving a whole CITY and doesn’t think she’s touched by what he said but that she’ll leave him for Joonghyuk 😂
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Since there is no physical indication that someone attack her, I feel like the constellation killed her to prevent Dokja from realizing something about their situation since this is the first time in a while he try to think more about the novel and she is the only other person who know so much about it and you got to admit it was weird that Dokja suddenly fell asleep"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Did she not have enough coins for the day maybe? ;^;
93,"Mar 30, 2022","whAt?!? I was going to finish the ep and then comment ""anyone else ship dokja x suyeong 😏"" ... but then she is WHAT??? a corpse??? 😭😭 NO I DON'T BELIEVE IT"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","""But from the reactions of people I've met recently,"" someone should do a compilation of that haha"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Ok I’m had this theory since that theater scene where that creepy monster said something along the lines of coup you be … 
But I think Dokja is a constellation and the author  and this whole world is Author Dokja having pulled a memory wipe on himself to make things end the way he wants since Jungyeok keeps not delivering "
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Okay but where is his other child let’s get back to him please and thank you . 
93,"Mar 30, 2022","oh no, did she not meet some quotas?"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",But I liked her. What happened.⁉️
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Just as I started to like her.
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Did Suyeong die because she failed to meet the 500 coin fee? She mentioned that she was getting less coins.
93,"Mar 23, 2022",i spent coins to avoid a cliffhanger and i ended up with a worst cliffhanger
93,"Mar 15, 2022",No this can’t be true RIGHT????????
93,"Mar 11, 2022","Wait wait wait wait, Sooyoung is now considered a character???? Now this is interesting. "
93,"Feb 28, 2022",Its like dokja and suyeong are siblings lol
93,"Feb 27, 2022","Don't worry Dokja, You're really handsome for me"
93,"Feb 24, 2022",yo I'm not really gay tbh but I think dokja is hot. (King of the potatoes donates 5 coins)
93,"Feb 23, 2022",I bet Yuseung was gonna ask if he would marry her if and when she became strong 😂 
93,"Feb 23, 2022",secretive plotter has been paying close attention to him from the start.... Very suspect. some really good theories floating around the comments but I'm leaning towards SP being the author of TWSA.
93,"Feb 23, 2022","waits she's dead? Why I absolutely loved her character development, and abilities."
93,"Feb 23, 2022","The episode started and ended with Dokja waking up. What does it mean though? I guess he needs a fable to become a constalation, and this weird traumatic loop is going to be it? "
93,"Feb 23, 2022","I can’t wait to see how they depict how the other characters see him! And I really can’t wait to see the “Second Protagonist” from TWSA. Also to all the other light novel readers, do you prefer narrative or fabled for the translation?"
93,"Sep 22, 2022",So uh dokja wife application when
93,"Sep 11, 2022",Y’all need to stop calling my man UGLY 😤
93,"Sep 4, 2022",it's just one of her avatar.. RIGHT?????!? 😭
93,"Aug 3, 2022",SHE DID NOT BECOME A CORPSE– WHYYYY
93,"Jul 8, 2022",""" I just transcribed the dream that i had"" Nw that I read the Light novel, I'm just amazed by the foreshadowing"
93,"May 22, 2022",The way my heart dropped- 
93,"May 20, 2022",who killed Suyeong?
93,"May 20, 2022",Girl you better say sike right now or I swear 
93,"Apr 27, 2022",No one gonna talk about Suyeong not being a plagiarist? Okay. 
93,"Apr 22, 2022","After a lot of chapters later on, I hope when you reread this, you get as excited as I am now when I saw a huge hint being dropped in this chapter"
93,"Apr 8, 2022","""prisoner of the golden headband"" and ""secretive plotter"" are true Dokja stans"
93,"Apr 6, 2022",I’m so sad I found this series yesterday and read the whole thing just to come up to this point and realize I have to wait for episodes now 😭😭
93,"Apr 6, 2022",Any one give me conins 😰😰
93,"Apr 5, 2022",Did she die because constellations were thinking she knew too much? Or did she not sleep the 6 hours last night and this one?
93,"Apr 4, 2022",IS SHE DEAD STOP
93,"Apr 3, 2022",YOU KNOW WHAT- IF LYING DOWN PRETENDING TO BE A DEAD BODY MEANS THAT I CAN SURVIVE THEN I WILL DO SO
93,"Apr 3, 2022",NO WTF I WAS STARTING TO LIKE HER
93,"Apr 3, 2022",idk why everyone don't find dokja handsome HAHA
93,"Apr 3, 2022","shit, I managed to read as far as this in 4 days man. 4-7 hours of reading in the past 3 days and I dedicated my whole 10 hours today in reading this. It's just too interesting! I love the creators of this amazing webtoon!"

93,"Apr 2, 2022",I genuinely don't know If their in the book or if Dokja has some derealization issues lmao 
93,"Apr 2, 2022","Idk if everyone is being like me (piling up episodes then binging them in one night) or they’ve all renounced since the likes are less…. jk😂 Also, please tell me that’s an avatar and she’s alive somewhere🥲🥲"
93,"Apr 2, 2022","Suyeong has proved that she never plagiarized TWSA, yet her story is so similar to it that it could basically be from the same writer. She mentioned having dreams then using them as a guide for her book….is she the author? She vehemently denies it and I believe she’s being sincere but maybe she just doesn’t remember because something or someone prevented her from doing so? And in regards to Secretive Plotter, I’m betting that he’s definitely an Outer God for sure."
93,"Apr 2, 2022",Wait. no. DONT DO THIS IM ALREADY ATTACHED TO HER
93,"Apr 2, 2022",NOOO SUYEONG
93,"Apr 1, 2022",A Corpse?!?! April fools?!😬😬nour? oh okay...jk I know she aint dead cause she's with the squad though

93,"Apr 1, 2022",Hahahahah omg he’s not bad looking omg he’s not ugly poor him 
93,"Apr 1, 2022",Dokjaaaa selfiessss hahahahahhahahahahaha 
93,"Apr 1, 2022","Dokja has activated the skill ""Protective Dad"""
93,"Mar 31, 2022","and I have a theorie that the writer is actually she, cause if she wrote it from her memories there is a chance that she actually lived it  and a future self wrote it again do that's th loop continue. I don't know is pretty crazy but also really cool"
93,"Mar 31, 2022",DOKJA IS SO FINE 😔🤝🏾
93,"Mar 31, 2022","honestly, why do i think “secretive plotter” is actually dokja, and that his existence regresses without the memories and skills but an infinite scale of opportunity, so that in some cases, he’s the hero, in some he’s killed in the first scenario"
93,"Mar 31, 2022",Nooo! I love her! Shes not dead though. No way. 
93,"Mar 31, 2022",Han Sooyoung's birthday is April 1st! Don't wallow in sadness for too long over her death anniversary and wish her a happy birthday instead!
93,"Mar 31, 2022","Ok so dude, gonna be honest. You’re cute. Not “cute~” not HOT. Just “cute” like you’ve got the features to be considered cute for masculinity. Not quite feminine but it’s there…. The type old ladies and grandpa’s will say to you, “Awww, what a handsome and adorable young man!” You’ve got youth you look young and that’s good. So yeah….. cute… sorry dude. But one thing I do have to say also that your amazing as is and that’s more than enough and that’s HOT! "
93,"Mar 31, 2022",did she not sleep enough? I hope atleast it's a skill and that she's not actually dead
93,"Mar 31, 2022",She what?! She died??? Maybe because she didn't meet the conditions established? Or is it just a way of saying she's in deep sleep? 😩 (ps: Dokja worrying about Junghyeok being more handsome skkdjkshdh please-)
93,"Mar 31, 2022","I wonder if there's a reason for them thinking he's ugly. Many authors tend to make their characters ugly if they're intended to be ugly even if they're the mc, so is there like a filter covering his face or something? no spoilers pls, I'm just ranting "
93,"Mar 31, 2022","Man people are being sad about Han sooyoung dying, meanwhile I’m still traumatized about the ending the novel"
93,"Mar 31, 2022",Well... damn
93,"Mar 31, 2022",When he said “you’re ugly” omggg LMAO
93,"Mar 31, 2022",just realized that when Dokja becomes a constellation his username is probably gonna be Omniscient Reader and that's when we get the title drop
93,"Mar 31, 2022",ayyy what's going on 😟
93,"Mar 31, 2022",Theory-i think that there was a renowned constellation who opposed this star stream system since the very beginning (bcz this system tends to destroy the worlds of the lving beings) but no one paid attention to him....so he wrote about the whole stream system in a novel form and published it in different worlds so that the creatures could read it and get the knowledge of what to do when this becomes a reality!!! But who's that constellation?? 
93,"Mar 31, 2022",Whoa.... That is strangely..... sad......
93,"Mar 31, 2022",What if the secretive plotter is his future self?
93,"Mar 31, 2022",NO. I LIKED HER SHE BETTER NKT BE DEAD
93,"Mar 31, 2022",did she just...die??
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Well, that escalated quickly"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Although she might have been a nuisance, seeing her die would prolly throw me to the depths of the void, says sleepy constellation while gently falling to the void of his bed and pillow"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Whaaaaaaat!?!? Not suyeong!!!
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Ah yes lets go to the women who barely tolerates me first when i need to ask how good looking of a man i am, what could go wrong?"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",HAHAHA dokja's bathroom selfie I can't 🤣🤣
93,"Mar 30, 2022",The author create a great work because if you didn't notice he was giving coins to Dokja since the beginning 
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Calling it, Secretive Plotter is Dokja after he transcends into a Constellation"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Wait, I have a question- doesn't he already have two fables? ""King of a world without a king"" and the other one (I don't remember the name). So why is he saying he doesn't have one?? ;-;"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",was it sangah? did she plot to kill her?
93,"Mar 30, 2022",could han sooyoung be one of the writers? when all the writer has the same dream and only the last writer lived to see and wrote the real ending. 🤔
93,"Mar 30, 2022","""But I have to admit that it's comforting to have her around"" and I have to admit that they're my favorite team so far"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","""If I could do something like that, I wouldn't be in this mess right now"" well, that's true haha"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","
what kind of twist is this"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",wtf she dead??? nooo I like her
93,"Mar 30, 2022",holy cow. we didn't get enough Han SuYeong.. so why does it have to be her... whyyy??
93,"Mar 30, 2022",I can down to the comments just to see if anyone was talking about her :<
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Detecting a love n blush from suyeung. I wonder if shes gradually growing her feelings towards dokja

Edit : I mean Yuseung.... sorry"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",she must not have had enough coins after all she said that she wasn't getting many coins now
93,"Mar 30, 2022",1. he's fine af 2. that escalated quickly 
93,"Mar 30, 2022","uhhh, did he mean “became a corpse” in a simile way or literal way??"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",bitch WHAT. I was starting to genuinely like her 😭😭
93,"Mar 30, 2022","They must be exhausted, he said he’d take guard first, falls asleep, wakes up thinking it wasn’t his shift to start with. And now she’s dead? Wtf happens this night.. "
93,"Mar 30, 2022","chill she's one of the main characters, that bitch ain't easy to kill. "
93,"Mar 30, 2022",she's sleeping right.. 
93,"Mar 30, 2022",There is a super important hint to a very late event
93,"Mar 30, 2022","And just like that, they killed my favorite character. :("
93,"Mar 30, 2022",waittt is she dead now??? why?? Dokja ur handsome ...
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Oh come on, she was my FAVORITE!"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Well that was a bit of a shock. I wonder dis she run out of coins or did someone not want her to disclose more of her dreams.
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Dokja has no clue he has a whole fan base of admirers who ADORE him And I AM ONE OF THEM- 
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Tbh I really miss Hyeonseong , Huiwon and Gilyeong...pls bring 'em back🥺"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Ok if Suyeong Is dead i will cry... She has always been accused of plagiarism but in the end she was just writing about stuff she dreamed of... It must have been difficult, poor girl 😭. Maybe She was seeing a different future who knows"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","what's wrong with people?  dokja and junghyeok are almost similar looking to me, JH just has broader and taller built and a lil different hairstyle. for me in fact dokja is more attractive than JH"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",u can't just leave us hanging like this it's unfair
93,"Mar 30, 2022",a corpse?
93,"Mar 30, 2022",If any of yall think dokja is ugly yall need to see the novel illustrations 😭 actually regardless of what you think of him yall NEED to see the novel illustrations theyre so pretty 
93,"Mar 30, 2022","This episode was so funny, then also has mystery/detective and ends up with a dramatic plot twist. Insane "
93,"Mar 30, 2022","she probably used her skill to leave a fake behind again, or it's because she didn't sleep the 6 required hours"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",oh come on just when i was starting to like her she dies
93,"Mar 30, 2022",...I beg your pardon?😃
93,"Mar 30, 2022",i have to point out how Secretive Plotter is synonymous with Anonymous Writer
93,"Mar 30, 2022",I think secretive's plotter is actually one of the character's future self who has become a constellation 🤨 Poor Dokja to be given that sympathy for his look 🤣 he looks desperate
93,"Mar 30, 2022",so sus how he fell asleep and she ends up DEAD. something is up yall and I want to know what the HELL IT IS 
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Guys hear me out I have a theory..... Since Han sooyoung was telling the truth about not plagiarising the story how could she have written it only using dreams and premonitions ? like her version is almost the same as the original..... What if she is the actual author of TWSA?!!!! OMG ( guys this is just a theory I haven't read the light novel so idk if this is a spoiler or not if it is I'm sorry )
93,"Mar 30, 2022",She’s a corpse?!!!😳
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Watch. She isnt the 5th scenario anymore. Bug boy is

93,"Mar 30, 2022",Han Sooyoung's birthday is April 1st. What a chapter to say this on lol......
93,"Mar 30, 2022","I sure hope that when he says “corpse” he’s just referring to the fact that she’s asleep, she wouldn’t be killed off like that right? Not after what she said about her dreams, ..right?😃"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Did she fail to pay coins?
93,"Mar 30, 2022",wait what don't tell me she is dead 
93,"Mar 30, 2022",I'm going to be so upset if she's actually dead.
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Just me or is Dokja hotter than Junkhyeoke? 
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Okay who put their camp to sleep and killed Suyeong
93,"Mar 30, 2022",She wasn’t cut up- how’d he know she was dead?

93,"Apr 7, 2022","Bringing back my comment from some episodes ago: Usually Dokja's called ugly by everyone but when there was an actual description of his face in the novel it went like this: ""They looked at Kim Dokja's fluttering hair. They saw his long eyelashes, his eyes, his white cheeks and sadly distorted lips."" Doesn't sound ugly to me tbh"
93,"Apr 6, 2022",i don’t know if i should laugh or no 😭😭
93,"Apr 6, 2022","Honestly im really in love with the way the story is written in this with how, the mc is able to predict the future of certain events to a degree but his influence changes every outcome that he thinks will happen, I also really like how whenever he meets a new character or point in the story he begins to remember that section of the plot, its a very interesting way to setup a character as a writer since both you and the mc know the course of events now and in the future."
93,"Apr 6, 2022",“You’re ugly” 😂

93,"Apr 3, 2022","we're all joking about how she became a ghost, whatch the next episode reveal that she's actually dead"
93,"Apr 3, 2022",Oh no. She's a corpse. That's so sad.
93,"Apr 3, 2022",What if Dokja is the writer himself.
93,"Apr 3, 2022",she cant die D: HOW COME SHE DIES SO EARLY IT HASNT BEEN THAT LONG YET
93,"Apr 3, 2022",this is why i constantly wanna throw hands with the characters in this story. kim dokja is so darn pretty. he and jonghyuk are basically dilfs imo-- but thats not what's important here. 
93,"Apr 3, 2022",I’m sorry. What..? I just caught up after being away for a bit and THIS is what you end with..? 😥

93,"Apr 3, 2022","after reading the novel, this manhwa looks light hearted compared to the atmosphere the novel makes."
93,"Apr 3, 2022",Dokja! 😂😂 did she die because he thought that it was comforting to have her around!?
93,"Apr 3, 2022","Dokja is handsome periodt. A little spoiler tho, you MUST NOT doubt Dokja’s handsome face ever ‘coz there’s a reason on why the characters are telling him he’s ugly 😉"
93,"Apr 2, 2022",WAAAAAAHHHH HAVE YOU SEEN THIS CHEESY AS PIE?? https://youtu.be/T5dL4vAmTcc
93,"Apr 2, 2022","lmaoo the part where Han sooyoung talks about the books, I see what y'all did there 😃"
93,"Apr 2, 2022","wait I just found this comic online with more episodes then here...?? 
is that legal? does anyone know if it's legit? I don't wanna support it if it's not by the author, I'm happy to wait here in Webtoon for more episodes "
93,"Apr 2, 2022",What if Dokja is secretive plotter?Just an idea
93,"Apr 2, 2022",SPOILER!!: i saw some people saying that he was king ugly so that's why other people always see him unatractive lmao can someone explain?? i really want to know idc if its a spoiler pls 😭
93,"Apr 2, 2022",NO WHAT
93,"Apr 2, 2022","I'm 40 chapters into the novel, over 1k pages, yet I still have absolutely no clue as to who Secretive Plotter is. I have a hunch, but no evidence. "
93,"Apr 2, 2022",him hyping himself up in the mirror is so funny
93,"Apr 2, 2022","I’m sorry, WHAT!? Suyeong!"
93,"Apr 1, 2022",THE THUMBNAIL looooooool 🤣 I CAN'T
93,"Apr 1, 2022",.h
93,"Apr 1, 2022",wth happened there??
93,"Apr 1, 2022",Nah she not dead.
93,"Apr 1, 2022","I'm kinda bothered that her name's spelled as ""Shin Yuseung"" as it is spelled as  ""Shin Yoosung"" in the novel"
93,"Apr 1, 2022",This user named KDJ AND YJH's daughter just fucking spoiled who the author of TWSA on Chapter 97. What the freaking fuck.
93,"Apr 1, 2022",husky dokja
93,"Apr 1, 2022",Ngl she was a jerk but I wasn't ready for her dying
93,"Apr 1, 2022",HAPPY BIRTHDAY AS WELL AS DEATHDAY TO HAN SOOYOUNG🎉🎊🎉🎊🎂hoping it's an avatar that died🤐
93,"Apr 1, 2022",hapi April fool's day HAHAHAH
93,"Apr 1, 2022",WHY DO THREE OF MY FAVOURITE CHARACTERS HAVE A BIRTHDAY TODAY????
93,"Apr 1, 2022","Curious. I wonder if she did a sorta suicide by purposely not meeting any of the goals. using something to sleep dokja and then letting the system take her. Afterall Dokja said it himself. she'd been acting strange for a bit since his decision. Plus her comments before her death seemed almost existential.Also I dont think secretive is the writer. Seems like a Red Herring. I do think Secretive knows who wrote it and whats going on. perhaps supports it?

93,"Apr 1, 2022",This is probably one of the only comics that don't stray away from the Mc and I love it 
93,"Apr 1, 2022",ok in my opinion Dokja looks alot better than (I'm not even gonna try to spell his name) 
93,"Apr 1, 2022",SAY SIKE RN
93,"Apr 1, 2022",NONONONO NO WAIT WAIT WAIT
93,"Apr 1, 2022","OVER 2000 WOOOO. Han Sooyoung's birthday is April 1st, today where I live btw!"
93,"Apr 1, 2022",I thought it was dodgy the way he feel asleep
93,"Apr 1, 2022",Oh shit she must have been into something fuc
93,"Apr 1, 2022",Hahahahhahaha that’s so funny how she spotted that he was lying looooooool
93,"Apr 1, 2022","No Dokja you are not ugly, you are really handsome "
93,"Apr 1, 2022","Did she not sleep enough and got the death penalty? Must be hard to fall asleep when your life depends on it. By the way way, considering Secretive Plotter isn't in TWSA and seeing his name and personality, maybe he is TWSA's author. Also, Dokja's emotional intelligence can't be that low right? How could Yuseung go to Jungyeok, she's obviously fallen for Dokja. He shouldn't let his judgment be clouded by what happened in some alternative reality that they have long diverged from. "
93,"Apr 1, 2022",happy bday my lovely hsy 🍋🐈‍⬛💕
93,"Mar 31, 2022",YEAH YEAH DOKJA IS HANDSOME. HES HOT. CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW SHE JUST LIKE DIED???????????

93,"Mar 31, 2022",wtf wtf wtf
93,"Mar 31, 2022","honestly that might be the first time I laughed so hard while reading this webtoon, aaaaaaand that ending gave me depression really quick. hope Dokja can edo tensei the shit out of her."

93,"Mar 31, 2022",she ain't dead guys dw
93,"Mar 31, 2022","Someone said it might be that she somehow broke the contract from chapter 70 (saying it here, because the OG comment was the 11th reply of the second top)"
93,"Mar 31, 2022",THE THIRD TOP COMMENT'S REPLIES IS SENDING ME SO MUCH
93,"Mar 31, 2022",His panic at the thought Yeseung might leave him for Junhyeok! 🤣
93,"Mar 31, 2022",I think she didn't get her 6 hours and the penalty is death. I too think secretive plotter is the TWSA author. 
93,"Mar 31, 2022",aaand like that she's dead XD lol
93,"Mar 31, 2022",To anyone that's red the novel where would we been in terms of chapters rn? Thinking of reading it.
93,"Mar 31, 2022","don't worry, Dokja. You are attractive. (No, I'm not attracted to you)"
93,"Mar 31, 2022","I mean corpse vs dead, this makes it seem like she could be good still lol"
93,"Mar 31, 2022",please tell me that you stated that because of the catgirls that have been ruining her life-
93,"Mar 31, 2022","Was it murder, or was the 500 coins before sleeping not payed? Or both."
93,"Mar 31, 2022",Did that girl pray to the Olympic gods to kill the plagiarist?
93,"Mar 31, 2022","Hmmmm…imma hope by her being a corpse, she’s just sleeping LIKE a corpse…"
93,"Mar 31, 2022","still not convinced she died that easily ..I mean she isn't that weak...from the last conversation,it's probably that she left for her own growth because I basically think that she is an individual that's not for group stuff afn ...she can do &grow better when she is alone and is capable of surviving by herself... don't tell me you guys forgot how smart she is ?"
93,"Mar 31, 2022",she better not be dead or I'ma throw some something
93,"Mar 31, 2022",WHAT
93,"Mar 30, 2022",What in the fook just happened

93,"Mar 30, 2022","Who else has a theory about the identity of the Secretive Plotter?  So far, my thinking is perhaps Odysseus."
93,"Mar 30, 2022",if she really dead. kill the bich ass who murdered her
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Everyone keeps saying dokja isn't good looking, that's fine, if they don't think he's good looking then alright, but atleast say he's normal looking, they're hurting my boy's feelings and lowering his self esteem, and I prefer dokja than anyone else if we're talking about looks and personality."
93,"Mar 30, 2022",No because calling Dokja ugly is the biggest cap I’ve ever seen. He’s literally my crush.
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Alright …what just happened?
93,"Mar 30, 2022","i don't like this trick you're pulling, but I refuse to believe milady is actually dead. The copium is gonna be running all week. Dokja is finally taking notice to the Secretive Plotter, and again, even as a straight dude, am lost on how everyone in this world thinks Dokja is ugly lol."
93,"Mar 30, 2022",WAIT WHAT

93,"Mar 30, 2022",I think she failed to do the scenario stuff
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Wait, she didn't plagiarize that doesn't make sense she has to have at least plagiarized to some degree her story is very similar unless no that can't be the case damn I'm extremely and emotionally confused also How Dear they deny Dokja's Beauty."

93,"Mar 30, 2022",they yassified dokja in this he’s actually an ugly bitch i’m sorry y’all 
93,"Mar 30, 2022",now I'm curious my first guess is she stayed up all night and the penalty is death and she got pretty damn deep maybe even suicidal but it honestly could just be a avatar she did say she was getting less coins from the constellations so she's trying to disband with dokja another thing is I had a strong feeling before secretive plotter was the creator of the book or was involved in some way this just made that feeling stronger
93,"Mar 30, 2022","""I chose you over Seoul. And I don't regret it,"" is one of my most favorite Dokja lines 🥺🥺🥺 sadly not that many people talk about it 😔"

93,"Mar 30, 2022","Bro, were they breaking the 4th wall just now?"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",The faker is a corpse? I'm not buying it. This ain't Game of Thrones where it's considered writing a clever twist for main characters to just randomly die in unsatisfying ways.
93,"Mar 30, 2022",my guess is that secretive plotter is Dokja unless the obvious statement is the carrot and the stick is still waiting I mean how hard is it to place a bet and throw a match but the only reason why there's no regression is due to the unexpected singularity the rise of a new constellation with a ever shifting fable but takes a back seat to watch the next round unfold because all paths leading away from the beginning will eventually find it's way to the end with the Nexus being perpendicular
93,"Mar 30, 2022","I'm sorry, WHAT!? You don't know who Secretive Plotter is!? You can't find information about them in TWSA!!? And you're only bringing this up NOW!!!?? Has it not occurred to you that they could be the freaking Author? Seriously, how is this only NOW being brought up!?!?!?
 Also - what even is the deal with Suyeong anymore!?"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","maybe after this story end, it is all just a dream a dream of dokja😅"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Remember in the beginning of the story, the author of TWSA said they won a competition before sending Dokja the whole novel? Maybe the ‘competition’ the author won was them creating a fable to become a constellation… so the novel became reality and the author might be a constellation???"
93,"Feb 25, 2022",You will see. If they dont rush the webtoon it will be revealed as it should. It just gets crazier from here lol

93,"May 10, 2022",I reread the story in the first few chapters [Secretive Plotter] has been here from the beginning and I got the impression they new of things beforehand. could they be the author?
93,"May 7, 2022",Sooyoung died because of Dokja's handsomeness
93,"May 6, 2022",SHIT I HOPE SHE'S NOT REALLY DEAD but also that mirror selfie panel 💀

93,"Apr 9, 2022","Damn they gave my boy Dokja a complex. He's handsome. And Suyeong is gorgeous. I love her stormy grey eyes. That's why I can't accept that she's dead. Dokja conveniently falls asleep to find her dead ""corpse"". It looks like she drugged him. I thought she was planning on killing Yuseung but now I think she just faked her death using her avatar. Those dreams of hers are awfully interesting. I wanted her to meet Huiwon. The dynamic between Yuseung, Sangah, and Huiwon 🤣👌"
93,"Apr 8, 2022",49% 51% panel
93,"Apr 7, 2022","ah yeees, Dokja acting like the hardworking dad who's afraid the cool uncle will take his child away jsjsjs :3"
93,"Apr 7, 2022",she's a corpse!?!?!? WHAT IN THE WORLD HAPPENED !!!
93,"Apr 7, 2022","They changed his appearance. In the novel he is supposed to be average - ugly, but since hot characters sell more they made him handsome in the Webtoon creating this confusing mismatch between how he is addressed and his actual appearance."
93,"Apr 7, 2022",[The Lazy Broke Weeb] is somehow always busy sponsoring coins in the comments despite being broke... hmm 🤔
93,"Apr 6, 2022",NO NO NO NO NO NO NO EVEN THOUGH SHES COLD AND SELFISH I WAS BEGINNING TO NOT BE THAT BOTHERED BY HER PRESENCE AND SHE ACTUALLY HAS A P COOL MIND AND — :((((
93,"Apr 6, 2022","oh, yeah. I had forgotten The 'Dokja's crappy face' joke 😂😂"

93,"Apr 6, 2022",THE DAY IS HERE
93,"Apr 6, 2022",yes dokja ur very handsome u yjh cant compare
93,"Apr 6, 2022","""I raised her, so as his new adoptive parent that I am, I will not let her choose her future"" great parenting Dokja"
93,"Apr 6, 2022","Damn poor Dokja, getting possessive of Yuseong because he feels she'll leave his side for Junghyeok... She's a literal child, and a very polite one at that. She wouldn't do that to anybody, my harmless queen. That is, until her future self comes and destroys the city, bur thAT'S NOT IMPORTANT-"
93,"Apr 5, 2022","Our poor man, whats there not to like about him besides be a hypocrite?"
93,"Apr 5, 2022",A body has been discovered

93,"Mar 31, 2022",UM WHAT
93,"Mar 31, 2022",WAIT WHAT 
93,"Mar 31, 2022",if she didn’t get as many coins it could just be that she used her avatar skill and went somewhere else to get more money
93,"Mar 31, 2022",she better not be dead or I'm gonna rage
93,"Mar 31, 2022",Whoa whoa whoa!
93,"Mar 31, 2022","just came back from reading a ton of the novel (it slaps) and its pretty cool to have context for things going on in the webtoon, and to see my favorite scenes illustrated"
93,"Mar 31, 2022",How did she just die?? Nah she's sleeping hard because Dokja called her ugly. But didn't she get her head chopped off and was still fine??? She's didn't just die
93,"Mar 31, 2022",DUN DUN DUN! And just like that we have now enter a murder mystery scenario.
93,"Mar 31, 2022",hil
93,"Mar 31, 2022",wait did she just die...
93,"Mar 31, 2022","I honestly think Dokja is more handsome than Junghyeok, Dokja is totally my type indeed but I would argue he is more handsome "
93,"Mar 31, 2022",Wtf?
93,"Mar 31, 2022",Say sike rn
93,"Mar 31, 2022","I cant wait for Yuseung to meet her brother Gilyeong🥰🥰 Dokja, father of the fauna siblings lol"
93,"Mar 31, 2022",Its probably cause of the sub scenario if she didnt sleep
93,"Mar 31, 2022","i get an headache everytime they talk about how the novel came to be, and i even red the novel, even knowing the answe doesn't make it any better, like in the world after the fall."
93,"Mar 31, 2022",I think she died because she didn't pay the survival fee before going to sleep in the sub scenario
93,"Mar 31, 2022",Ohhhh! what if secretive plotter is TWSA's author??? It would make so much sense! (secretive PLOTter) (and that'd explain why he's so eager of knowing how dokja handles stuff!) (yeah ik tc said that theory already but I had that come to my mind before reading it and had to share here 😆)
93,"Mar 31, 2022",I feel that secretive plotter is actually Dokja as a constellation after he obtains a fable
93,"Mar 31, 2022",Even a nap costs 500? C’MON!!!!
93,"Mar 31, 2022",Wait wait wait don't do that to us
93,"Mar 31, 2022",hmmm could she have found out something she should not have? or what if that what she pry to the Olympics gods to do?
93,"Mar 31, 2022",she didn't sleep enough 
93,"Mar 31, 2022",Please be a fake body
93,"Mar 31, 2022","OMFG right?! What the heck? Was there a sleep spell or something ? What was this whole getting suddenly sleepy out of nowhere, and since when does he have sweets slumbers? And then she's just already a cold corpse but appears to be unharmed physically?!....... OMG, do you think that the other girl prayed for her to die?!"
93,"Mar 31, 2022","I was definitely confused about them taking watches...considering they ALL need 6 hours to not die for the scenario. Even so, I've come to like her, so...I definitely didn't expect that."
93,"Mar 31, 2022",no no no no no no why?!!!!!
93,"Mar 31, 2022",is it worth reading the novel when it'll spoil the webtoon? 
93,"Mar 31, 2022",meaning she's dead?
93,"Mar 30, 2022","[Constellation ""Herald of the Black Dawn"" has been hustling for those free coins to bestow here.]"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","She can make fakes, so she may have just left"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Noooooo!!! Why?!!!! How could you do this?!!! She's my favorite!!!!!

93,"Mar 30, 2022",shit...no way
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Secretive plotter is either loki or the writer of twsa. Corpse? I think she is up to something.
93,"Mar 30, 2022",So many readers are so shocked lmao
93,"Mar 30, 2022",what about the possibility that they were visions of the future instead? 
93,"Mar 30, 2022","noo, don't die 🙏"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",n..noooo
93,"Mar 30, 2022","become a corpse what do meannnnnn , is she dead ?!!!!!!!"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Oh, and Secretive Plotter! Anyone thinks is the author of TWSA? "
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Wait, so mamy things have happened in this episode... I think we can all agree that Dokja is terribly wrong with Yuseung, I mean, it's obvius that is she is up to become a fan of someone, it would be the one taken care of her, i. e. Dokja in this case. Also, he is jealous hehe. WHAT JUST HAD HAPPENED? Why they fall sleep and why is Suyeong unconscious or dead?"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",SHE DIED?? Maybe she didn’t have enough coin or something? I feel like someone killed her tho. Strange that dokja just fell asleep so suddenly ya know.
93,"Mar 30, 2022",also dokja is hot why are they all so mean to him 😭
93,"Mar 30, 2022",I think you're good looking Dokja!! 
93,"Mar 30, 2022",NOOOOOOOOOOO
93,"Mar 30, 2022",secret plotter is either dokja or the writer of tswa
93,"Mar 30, 2022",nooo why did the wifu Material die?
93,"Mar 30, 2022",she's dead......
93,"Mar 30, 2022",CORPSE !?!?

93,"Mar 30, 2022",Bet she didn't pay 500 fee
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Oh god no
93,"Mar 30, 2022","""She is my incarnation that I've raised!"" Dokja acting like a single dad already 😭"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",My bet on who the secretive plotter is: the author. 
93,"Mar 30, 2022",SHE'S A WHAT????
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Aw man just when they were bonding! :( I hope she’s okay…. Doubt it tho
93,"Mar 30, 2022",i think he is hot !!!
93,"Mar 30, 2022",also wow Dokja-ssi you dressed properly in your salaryman days but why are you showing your ankles now in the apocalypse
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Yo wth is that character death bruhhhhh
93,"Mar 30, 2022",So they just lost one of there strongest allies really kinda have an idea why but still really.

93,"Mar 30, 2022",doesn't he have 2 fables 
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Does someone remember in which chapter her avatar skill is explained? And in which chapter their contract is explained? My memory is not so clear.
93,"Mar 30, 2022",*A BODY HAS BEEN FOUND*
93,"Mar 30, 2022",I went online to see if she was actually dead and i accidentally clicked on smth that spoiled the entire story 🥶🤡
93,"Mar 30, 2022",i wanna tell the new readers abt what happened to sooyoung but yeah no 
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Highschool kim dokja mirror selfie is now hereeee
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Suyoung didn't plagiarise the novel? Interesting
93,"Mar 30, 2022",what if the author of twsa was the plagiarizer 👀 and what she had was a vision
93,"Mar 30, 2022","RIP Suyoung, we will always remember you!"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Dokja… why do you keep adopting children???? Also maybe since it’s drawings there’s not much of a difference. But Jugyeok Yu definitely has a manlier face and is more “sexy” I suppose, but Dokja looks like he could be his brother. So idk why people say Dokja isn’t attractive. "
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Not Dokja getting possessive over Yuseung 💀
93,"Mar 30, 2022",The bathroom selfies were greater than I could’ve ever imagined

93,"Mar 30, 2022","""Not bad. Maybe a little handsome too"" lol me"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",I swear if it was that she couldn’t pay the coins
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Dokja is SO FINE but they don't wanna admit it
93,"Mar 30, 2022",NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Oh. 
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Damn it. I finally catch up to the release and this is the cliffhanger!!!!
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Did she just pull an ""On time"" reference?"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",dokja stop acting like you dont know ur hot 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
93,"Mar 30, 2022",I just love Dokja and Suyeong's dynamic . they understand each other so well which is why they're so mean to each other 
93,"Mar 30, 2022","""[Some constellations consider your behavior cocky.]"" I mean, when isn't he? "
93,"Mar 30, 2022",I reread episode 1 and saw that it said if you read all the way to the end you WILL survived… so does that mean Dokja will survive?
93,"Mar 30, 2022",HUH??!
93,"Mar 30, 2022",What if secret plotter is Dokja in the future and he is the writer of TWSA
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Secretive plotter to be the author man.  Also how the author just kill her!
93,"Mar 30, 2022","we lost the ""hyung likes"" line, but we got a whole, illustrated selfie. law of equivalent exchange or smth idk i don't listen in math"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",I thought I never liked suyeong but now I don't know why but I feel like crying
93,"Mar 30, 2022",Watch secretive plotter be the dokja from the future 
93,"Mar 30, 2022",imagine she was actually asleep
93,"Mar 30, 2022",NOOOOOOOOO

93,"Mar 30, 2022",ok how did this go from hilarious to total unexpected horrible bomb at the end??
93,"Mar 30, 2022","so it's kinda like when a dad doesn't want his daughter to date boys, except it's to NEVER even LOOK at this one REALLY SPECIFIC guy"
93,"Mar 30, 2022","of course. if there was any lesson I learned from stories, it was that those who begin to get development die. screw you danganronpa.."
93,"Mar 30, 2022","Okay, where's Lazy Broke Weeb?"
93,"Mar 30, 2022",dokja taking picture in front of toilet mirror hshshshshshs

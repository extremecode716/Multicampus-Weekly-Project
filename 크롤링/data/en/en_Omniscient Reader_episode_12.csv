Episode,Date,Review
12,"Sep 2, 2020",For webtoon only readers: yjh is a REGRESSOR not a RETURNEE. I hope the translator will fix this mistranslation 😔 edit: thanks for the fix 💕 for those saying “thanks for the spoiler” in response to my previous edit it was explained in this chapter what a regressor is. It says “he has regressed three times already” and “previous runs”. I made this comment so the translator could fix this mistake. Please google the definition of regressor vs returnee to understand the important difference!
12,"Sep 3, 2020","""I liked you, hated you, resented you, and cheered for you"" ""I was with you throughout your _ episode journey""~i also want to say those words to my favorite characters in stories i read. I feel you dokja T_T"

12,"Sep 2, 2020",Me seeing all the comments about regressor and not knowing what that means
12,"Sep 3, 2020",for the people that don't know the difference of regressor and returner... Regressor - someone who goes back in time.... Returner - someone who got summoned(isekaid) to another world then returned back to earth. 
12,"Sep 18, 2020",Listen Yu Jungheok... Committing homicide is not a coping mechanism...
12,"Sep 2, 2020",It’s too early for the protagonist to break the fourth wall

12,"Oct 14, 2020",it's been like an hour and junghyeok is already in his kirito cosplay 
12,"Sep 2, 2020",That fourth wall skill seems like it will be very useful. Though I do wonder what his attributes are and skills. It's also weird that he can't see it himself. what did this all mean? 
12,"Oct 14, 2020","sdkjfbdshbfkjrehc ralksdfv he's hot. I mean, I guess he was called the hottest character in the novel after all. "

12,"Oct 14, 2020",And here we begin the long running theme of YJH grabbing KDJ by the neck
12,"Sep 30, 2020",So did YJH really took the train dressed like that? Does no one question his sword? Lol
12,"Oct 14, 2020",and hence starts the journey of YJH trying to kill Dokja every time he sees Dokja. ✌️
12,"Oct 8, 2020",Not Kim Dokja snarking at the protagonist that could kill him with one finger while he’s being dangled off a bridge by said protagonist 🙈

12,"Sep 2, 2020",Fourth wall lmao
12,"Oct 14, 2020",Wow OR fans are really something they got Webtoon to change the name in such a short amount of time. From Returnee to Regressor good job guys!
12,"Sep 6, 2020",<<Forth Wall detected the detection skill>> I thought that bit was kinda funny
12,"Oct 14, 2020",Don’t you think you should cross the bridge first before killing him? For safety precautions 😂😂
12,"Oct 14, 2020","Um wtf, y is the main character of TWSA so freakin hot? Like I’m fan girling rn"
12,"Oct 14, 2020","For those of you who've asking whats Regressor means. Its a ability to turn back time or you have to restart. its like a game that when you die, there's a pop option where it showed up called restart whereas you'll get back from the beggining. Returnee means you've been summoned to another world and there's a tasks that you have to complete in order to get back into your own world. there's a kind of novel named ""EER Everyone else is a Returnee"". i recommend you guys if you want to read"

12,"Oct 14, 2020","All these people in work or casual attire and Junghyeok comes in looking like a super model in all black clothes topped with a trench coat. I'm like, bruh what are you doing in a subway?? All this time thinking of YJH in casual clothes – shirt and jeans – during the early scenarios I am deprived"
12,"Oct 18, 2020",don't you guys feel ✨ chemistry ✨ ?
12,"Oct 14, 2020",Webnovel readers when they see the fourth wall 👀
12,"Oct 14, 2020",Protagonist Vs. Protagonist 
12,"Oct 14, 2020",Mark my words this manhwa is going to be the best one in webtoon not only because of the art it's because of the plot and storytelling
12,"Oct 14, 2020",kdj's canonical choking kink ✨
12,"Sep 11, 2020",now why'd he have to be so attractive // edit >> Btw Dokja is attractive by default 😏 THE cUtest 😌
12,"Sep 9, 2020","They really changed Yoo Jonghyuk’s name, damn "
12,"Sep 7, 2020","the author literally said, ""nah, you don't get to know anything previous MC"""
12,"Oct 14, 2020","Wait okay so... I’m still way at the beginning of the light novel, but I just had a sudden theory pop into my head after reading this chapter. Since a lot of people are commenting the difference between a regressor (someone who travels back in time) and a returnee (someone who gets summoned to another world to complete a certain task), I’m thinking... what if the author of TWSA is a returnee from the world where TWSA takes place in, but then wrote a web novel based on it (as a warning)?"
12,"Sep 30, 2020",The protagonist is damn hot!!!
12,"Sep 2, 2020",Imagine them both walking across the bridge as comrades
12,"Feb 24, 2021",shut up dokja i dont need to know abt ur huge crush on yjh

12,"Oct 14, 2020",I will go down with this ship.
12,"Oct 14, 2020",One of the only stories where literal plot armor makes sense
12,"Oct 14, 2020","the omniscient part of the title makes sense to me now bcuz in point of view 3rd person omniscient, the narrator knows several character’s thoughts, feelings, motives, and etc. "
12,"Oct 14, 2020","Why are you guys using ""missions""?? its ""scenarios""! Im expecting more from a webtoon translator but damn "
12,"Jun 20, 2021","EREN JAEGER, I hated you, resented you, and cheered for you 🙏"

12,"Mar 13, 2021","It says in the novel that Junghyeok Yu was incredibly handsome, and I have to agree."
12,"Mar 8, 2021",to think this was the first time they met in rl and will soon become life and death companions... my gosh I'm tearing up

12,"Oct 14, 2020",when you realize you're the protagonist but you have to fight the protagonist
12,"Oct 14, 2020",Any scene containing Junghyeok and Dokja makes me so happy. Their dynamic is honestly amazing.
12,"Oct 14, 2020",Got it Regressor not Returnee... but we seriously just gonna ignore the tall dark bruding handsome gold eyed mans in the room for that??? Mannn either I'm tweekin or y'all eyes need check-in cause DAYUM he can turn me upside down any day chile😍😍😍- I'll let myself out. 
12,"Oct 14, 2020",THE FOURTH WALL HAS BLOCKED YOUR BULLSH#T
12,"Oct 14, 2020",the sunfish bastard has arrived 
12,"Oct 14, 2020","FUN FACT: You think Kim Dokja is hot? Kim Dokja is actually commonly referred to as a squid(someone who is ugly) or as the 'ugliest king'. lel. King meaning powerful figure. This didn't spoil anything, cause we all know the MC has to be OP later on"
12,"Oct 16, 2020",Omg I shiiiiiiipppppoppppppppppp
12,"Nov 12, 2021",The protagonist simply could not break the 4th wall! 🤣🤣
12,"May 13, 2021","""I liked you, hated you, resented you, and cheered for you"" Literally me to some of my favourite characters"

12,"Feb 25, 2021",I’m loving how the author had used all the reader’s term and turned them into powerful skills. 
12,"Nov 11, 2020",hubby's here
12,"Oct 25, 2020",looks like this Fourth Wall won't be broken so easily
12,"Oct 20, 2020",Lol “fourth wall” never thought he would have that kind of skill

12,"Oct 15, 2020",Loved the 4th wall protection 🤣
12,"Oct 14, 2020",when plot armor becomes an actual skill lol 
12,"Oct 14, 2020","YJH’s official debut on Webtoon! He looks gorgeous, as expected from him! "
12,"Oct 14, 2020","I've been reading this webnovel, and I've gotta say, it's pretty awesome! I'm glad its being made into a webtoon, and hope the creator does it the justice it deserves! :D"
12,"Oct 14, 2020","Theory Time - IF YOU HAVE READ THE WEB NOVEL PLEASE DON'T TELL ME IF I'M RIGHT OR WRONG:
 Knowing Dokja isn't the only person with foreknoweldge, I have to assume there is a third out there with the same kind of foreknowledge - and that person is probably the author of TWSA themself.

 Assuming that much, Junghyeok's time loops and subsequent decision through each iteration probably created the TWSA Author, who in turn created Dokja."
12,"Oct 14, 2020",Okay but like HE’s HoT
12,"Oct 14, 2020",that's a pro gamer move right there
12,"Oct 14, 2020",Bruh why is his name Yu Jeonghyeok again. I get that it's the more correct way to translate his name but like Yoo Jonghyuk forever...
12,"Dec 24, 2021","For someone who got his neck choked, you look pretty relaxed, kdj."
12,"Nov 19, 2021",i think he has a choking kink
12,"Oct 22, 2021",WHY IS DOKJA SO SMART AND HOT
12,"Aug 12, 2021",kinda fruity
12,"Aug 11, 2021","""i liked you"" fruity"
12,"May 1, 2021",Junghyeok look like an future version of Dokja
12,"Apr 27, 2021",I'm used to people breaking the 4th wall not using it for protection 😂😂
12,"Apr 27, 2021",he’s so hot 
12,"Apr 26, 2021","""... so... are we gonna cross this bridge to survive or not? 👀? "" 😂"
12,"Feb 27, 2021","Damn it, this man is hot!! I can't even with hot anime guys. I just hope he doesn't die"
12,"Dec 26, 2020",oh no he's hot
12,"Oct 16, 2020","""...unlike my previous runs"" 
EXCUSE ME WHAT"
12,"Oct 14, 2020","He is a Regresser! Coming from a novel reader, this must be changed!"
12,"Oct 14, 2020","I AM JUST SO SAD THAT THEY DIDN'T INCLUDE THE HONORIFICS LIEK- 😭😭😭 Please please don't change ahjussi to uncle or hyung to older bro or some  sh◾️t xD Ugh, I miss the way they call Dokja, Dokja-ssi :((("
12,"Oct 14, 2020",I'm assuming the reason why dokja was able to block the eye of the sage skill was because how much he understands him so the more he dokja understands someone the fourth wall will probably be stronger against the person dokja will face
12,"Oct 14, 2020",Ahh! He's hot!!!
12,"Oct 14, 2020",seems like whoever wrote the novel is trying to stop the loop.
12,"Oct 14, 2020",he's the..... PROTAGONIST

12,"Jan 1, 2021","From the other comments it seems like this jacket guy had some ability to retry the same thing? Which is why he knows who were supposed to survive. So it's like replaying the same level in a game. Well, I guess that explains the high stats so early on in the story. Phew. I think I get it now."

12,"Oct 24, 2020",why does this remind me of the scene where levi was kicking eren to death
12,"Oct 22, 2020",why are villains always so hot
12,"Oct 21, 2020","ok so apparently protagonist and main character aren't the same. According to Google, protagonist is the person who drives the plot forward and the main character is the one who gets impacted by the plot, meaning that Dokja is indeed our main character, but YJH is a protagonist. So TWSA main character is yet to make an appearance."
12,"Oct 20, 2020",The Fourth Wall... is a Power! XD Idk why but thats hilarious
12,"Oct 20, 2020",Who in the fresh Hot hell is this man??? 😊🤔
12,"Oct 19, 2020","Idk but they definitely have the potential of having the biggest bromance, an enemies to friends type beat"
12,"Oct 18, 2020",Why?!? Why ?!? Is everyone so hot in this webtoon?!?!!
12,"Oct 17, 2020","Now that Yu Jong Hyeok has appeared, I would love to say his fame as the most handsome man in TWSA is too much ahaha. At certain angles, it seems Kim Dokja can slap Yu Jong Hyeok in the face even when Kim Dokja is famed for being ugly"
12,"Oct 16, 2020",When the protagonist runs into a bigger protagonist.
12,"Oct 15, 2020",You can’t break the fourth wall.
12,"Oct 15, 2020",So that means the real protagonist has done this before? Is it like a respawn thing like in video game where he can keep trying again? Maybe that’s why he’s so pissed
12,"Oct 14, 2020","I can’t get over how beautiful this art style is. Like the faces are just gorgeous. Also, I’m falling in love with this WEBTOON very quickly😂"

12,"Sep 2, 2020","Damn. The basis of this comic and the original protagonists' title reminds me of this manga named Psyren. If you like this you'd probably like that. Point is, this webtoon is great and I'd pay to get it animated!"

12,"May 1, 2021",I am loving the name choices we saw namjoon and now jungkook
12,"Oct 14, 2020","The ""Protagonist"" isn't as handsome as I thought he'd be. Maybe because the manhwa made Dokja a lot more handsome than he should be, the artist wasn't able to make another attractive guy with a similar build without making the two guys look identical. Anyhow, I can't wait for the future arcs when they get so shippable. Lol. "
12,"Sep 23, 2022",The 4th wall has struck again

12,"May 25, 2021","Who here have read or watched High-rise Invasion? I enjoyed reading HRI but Omniscient Reader is way better than that. Also if you have read Sekai-Oni this is again the better version  of it. Not that HRI and Sekai-Oni are bad or anything. All these three stories are some really great scifi, horror, supernatural and dystopia mixing together. They question the human nature precisely. "

12,"May 2, 2021",i swear to god my comment a couple chapters ago has reappeared. a skill called Fourth Wall? i dig it
12,"May 1, 2021","Lol I’d predicted that he’d meet the protagonist way later on and the protagonist would end up being himself, like a mirror version of himself but just with certain personality traits highlighted to be more visible and then it’d be like a showdown against himself but I like where this is going too! Protagonist is not who majority of us must’ve expected him to be & I dokja seems to have some similarities w him which I think was done on purpose so it def seems interesting !! "
12,"Apr 30, 2021",so basically what I get from the store is the guy we're following read this as a web novel until it became reality and he and some of the people he knows from The real world are definitely in the story now but because they weren't supposed to be in the story they don't have character profiles and the guy who is supposed to be the protagonist it's basically gone through a kind of time loop scenario and this is his third time experiencing the end of the world is that about right?
12,"Apr 30, 2021",Wait wait wait soooooo this dude has been the MC of 3 past world-apocalypses???

12,"Aug 30, 2021",this is one of the very VERY few casual and normal conversations they have
12,"Aug 28, 2021",Ahhhh this is so cool! I love that battle of abilities. But dang let that man off that cliff wdge and onto some solid ground pls! He gon have some serious bruises
12,"Aug 13, 2021",Fourth wall coming in clutch.
12,"Apr 29, 2021","So he is someone that went back in time eh. Something tells me that he either is the one responssible for writing that novel in a future interation, or its possible that it was written by that Scretive plotter sponsor."
12,"Apr 29, 2021","never underestimate the power of the FOURTH WALL. Also, the scene with the Eye of the Sage activated on Jungyeoh's face was so cool! (⊙＿⊙)"
12,"Apr 28, 2021","This Yoo Jeonghyuk guy is so good at wasting precious time by disrespecting his ELDERS, I swear."
12,"Apr 28, 2021","Ohh I think I’m starting to understand the protagonist. I guess he’s gone through this three times before, so that’s why he knows what “should” happen. "
12,"Apr 28, 2021",Aaand I was right. The protagonist IS hot as hell
12,"Apr 28, 2021","Had to come to the comments to learn what a regressor is. So apparently the priest protagonist guy is playing this story like a pc game and has started over more than once because he died or reached the end of the game before? Dunno if it's gamer language, but we could've used an explanation for the word in the comic. Not knowing these types of rpg levelling games I'm a bit at a loss whenever they talk about game related things like stats, skills or attributes like I should know what that is."
12,"Apr 28, 2021", am I not the only one who thinks that the so called protagonist looks like Levi-
12,"Apr 26, 2021",THE 4TH WALL CAN'T BE BROKEN!!! 😂😂😂
12,"Apr 26, 2021",dang it. just cross the bridge already 🤣🤣🤣
12,"Apr 26, 2021",Omg it's a protag battle 
12,"Apr 21, 2021",something's telling me that I'm not going to like mc
12,"Apr 9, 2021",I’m a bit confused here I understand the character of the novel know some of the future because he started his life over three times but like what the heck does that even mean ? He is from the futur and already experienced the same apocalypse 3 times ?? And how did he even restart his life 3 time ? 
12,"Apr 7, 2021",this webtoon is so good
12,"Apr 7, 2021",Ooo he strong eh

12,"Feb 14, 2021",This is my new favorite comic
12,"Feb 11, 2021",I’m just not reading the comments anymore because people act like they don’t know how to not spoil. It’s not that hard to go discuss the novel under the novel comments online 😒

12,"Oct 16, 2020","They do know that a more accurate translation of his name is YOO JOOnghyuk, right? Cause it's spelt like 유중혁. There is a difference in sound with JUnghyuk or JOnghyuk. Am I the only one bothered by this? I would be spelling it wrong if I were to ever try to look it up in Korean. I'm just being nitpicky, don't mind me. "

12,"Oct 15, 2020","YJH's neck buckle thingy makes him look like a pastor or something lmao. Also, TL should read the webnovel for reference. The terms get really tricky like in this chapter; 'returnee' was used for someone who can reset their time by dying, but in the later chapters, 'returnee' will also be used for a person who was sent to another world, conquered it, and returned to their original world. Which is why the webnovel readers are urging the TL to change it to 'regressor' like in the source material."
12,"Oct 15, 2020",Dokja Outsmarted Junghyeok's Outsmarting... that's what I understand xD

12,"Oct 14, 2020",the fourth wall aka plot armor
12,"Oct 14, 2020",I know why they are doing the stamps is because online on manga park you can read up to chapter 25 and they don’t want people reading that one. Since the Korean raws are out and that’s it’s fan translated I don’t think they can take it down.

12,"Oct 14, 2020",got a question so at the start dokja has the whole story of TWSA on him so what happens if he edited it? Like he added characters or made someone a lot more stronger or more weaker

12,"Oct 14, 2020",This story is so good! I stared reading it through the one event that WEBTOON had but now I’m obsessed with it. Keep up the good work😊
12,"Oct 14, 2020",So Dokja is the only reader of the story the and Jungkeok played the the story as a game ? or else it wouldn't make sense when he says runs ?
12,"Oct 14, 2020",DAMN THIS IS GETTING GOOD !!! It seriously needs to be made an anime. 
12,"Oct 14, 2020",Me reading for the first time: Phew! 👀Poor translator(s) almost got eaten alive for whatever regressor/returnee typo error existed before I got here; I'm just grateful I get to read this action pack series💕

12,"Oct 14, 2020","Ok... 3 ways of surviving the apocalypse. The first is being a regression and I bet another way is to read the novel, since the last chapter said ""if you read this, then you'll survive"". And I bet the contest the author won was what allowed them to make the novel happen on Earth..."

12,"Oct 14, 2020",Why is no one commenting about how this protagonist seems to know things about how the story is supposed to go? I find it very suspicious 
12,1 days ago,will they bang? both looks hot
12,2 days ago,"okay. when i saw the collar, i thought he was a priest! a good man! kim nam gil from fiery priest! we will all be safe! and.. choked.. urgh.. okay.. he is not. we have anti-hero?"
12,3 days ago,💀💀
12,3 days ago,Junghyeok really takes Dokja's breath away
12,4 days ago,Saved by the fourth wall. What a present 😂
12,"Oct 10, 2022",first appearance 😍😍😍
12,"Oct 8, 2022","why tf the supposed protagonist wasting time...so frustrating, dude. 😩"
12,"Oct 6, 2022",For me only Dokja is the MC. I don't like Yu Junghyeok. And the eye of the safe was blocked by Dokja's skill. So does that mean he has a similar or higher level of power(both are the MCs in a way so that could be possible)
12,"Oct 6, 2022","what are you? i am someone who is going to kick your ass i am the mc you stupid piece of shit. 💀
"
12,"Oct 3, 2022",PEEEAAAKKKK
12,"Oct 2, 2022",that protagonist is somewhat annoying.
12,"Sep 9, 2022",i don't understand the plot. is the new guy the main character from the real story? someone explain to me everything plss
12,"Sep 9, 2022",this was so hot of dokja

12,"Aug 12, 2022",STOPPPPP
12,"Aug 10, 2022",he's hot
12,"Aug 8, 2022",Well….the protagonist is no longer the protagonist. Sorry cold looking dude 
12,"Aug 7, 2022","So the protagonist of the story knows whats supposed to happen?? And he said ""previous runs"" like hes done this before?!?"
12,"Aug 5, 2022",this is intresting does this happpened before and manhwas and manhuas and manga have a two protoganist lol
12,"Aug 5, 2022","This so called ""Protagonist"" is really annoying. I wish he would first appear in later missions after this one 😑"

12,"Jul 9, 2022","I'm loving this premise. this Main Character of the TWSA novel being a generic ""i get to the end and get sent back to the beginning"" protagonist, while the mc of this novel is a complete 3rd party who just happens to have read everything that will happen and is being aided by some mysterious being in (presumably) ending this cycle"
12,"Jul 7, 2022","This two!!
Actually better than romeo and juliet who both died because juliet can't bother to check a pulse. this two cannot exist without the other. Spoiler:



It is like their existences purpose is for each other, that kind of thing. AHHH JoongDok the best BL couple without the tag!"
12,"Jul 5, 2022",junghyeok's hands makes up for a perfect necklace
12,"Jul 5, 2022",Sooo TWSA is the universe where Dokja has not read the book? He must’ve just died in that book/timeline then? They are in the future/TWSA where Dokja has this knowledge which will then change the original story of TWSA? Is the secretive plotter the author of TWSA??
12,"Jul 5, 2022",oh so he's also know what's going on? like did he get stuck in a time loop?
12,"Jul 1, 2022",Dokja: *Breathes*yjh: 'I should kill him'

12,"Oct 14, 2020",Was I the only one who noticed that dokja was floating in air in one of the panels
12,"Oct 14, 2020",too much information how does that happen?
12,"Oct 14, 2020","Okay, this just got like... 5 times as compelling as it already was. Dokja is NOT the only person in this world with fore-knoweldge, but Junghyeok has it from being in a TIME LOOP!? Now I'm sure that Dokja only meant to avoid running into this guy until later, because he knew the Junghyeok would react poorly to an alteration of events playing out as they should."
12,"Oct 14, 2020",Can’t wait until they gather the rest of the crew. 
12,"Oct 14, 2020",I’m guessing this story is going to try to kill off the characters and making us wait in misery because of cliffhangers and then somehow integrate more dead characters into the plot.
12,"Oct 14, 2020",HIT HIM

12,"Dec 31, 2020",I don't like the Regressor at all his approach is terrible no wonder he is going through this a third time. It's because of his disgusting personality and the lack of ability to use allies.

12,"Jan 4, 2022","ok, I know it's fictional, and super powers. but how the hell isn't his neck being broken by being held up by his throat!! Total demolition of my suspension of disbelief.

12,"Oct 14, 2020","The fact that the OFFICIAL tl group already fucked up a simple but vital part of the story makes me extremely nervous. Yall know what this means, right? These ppl dont know what they are translating... If they read orv atleast just a few more chapters in of the novel they'll know the big contextual differences of regressor and returnee."

12,"Oct 14, 2020","I was really hoping for some more cheeky Dojka actions this chapter, I also can’t wait for Bilyung and Dojka to make their contract, dammit, it’s so good but weekly is killing me slowly"
12,"Sep 9, 2020","This is what confuses me so if all this just happened & started at the same time around the world, & they say the regressor went through this seven times already how did he go through this when it just happened already did he die and then come back to life and then realize what was going on how does that work out is my question basically?sooo need this background story of him... welp back to the novel 😂"
12,"Sep 2, 2020",okay but am I the omly.one thinking that it looks like he's just choking a reflection of himself

12,"Oct 14, 2020",Yoo jonghyuk is no where near as handsome as the novel claims him to be and kim dokja is much hotter than the novel depicted but whatever it’s a welcome change also there’s pretty much no way the author possibly could have drawn him to live up to expectations.
12,"Aug 9, 2021","“I liked you, hated you, resented you, and cheered for you. I was with you throughout your three-thousand episode journey.”

12,"Mar 1, 2022",The fake main character is annoying as hell.
12,"Jun 16, 2021",I wish Dokja would be just a bit kinder to Sangha instead of thinking of her as just meat suit obviously he sees her as another character but what difference does that make
12,"Oct 14, 2020",Ohh I have a feeling they are the same person 
12,"Oct 14, 2020",just wanna say that there is 25 chapter out in illegal sites 
12,"Oct 24, 2020","Oh damn. The protagonist looks nuts. Wow. What kind of protag is he? Wow, and Dokja Kim implies it’s luck keeping him alive now. Hmm... is he an agent of the constellations or whatever? A ‘main character’ actor? Lol fourth wall activate!"

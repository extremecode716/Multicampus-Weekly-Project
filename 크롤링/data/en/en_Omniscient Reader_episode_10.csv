10,"Oct 1, 2020","I've started reading the web novel and its soooo good! I'm so invested on stories that touch on morals, and it also has fantasy, and interesting characters and world building! I love romance in general but when these types of stories are good they end being my favorites! I expect a lot from the rest of the web novel and the webtoon, it feels as if its going to be amazing!"

10,"Oct 1, 2020",who wants to bet that once we finish reading this we will  be the next ones going through that
10,"Sep 30, 2020",He’s gonna be so fucked if the story changes cos everyone will question how he was so initiative and knowledgable at the start and now not. And he’s relying too heavily on his knowledge so he’d stress loads if it changed. Do everything the same as the character as much as possible! 
10,"May 22, 2021",I am in love with the ART STYLE!!!

10,"Sep 30, 2020",the test will be easythe test: 
10,"Sep 30, 2020",Okay so I have a theory what if this was just a way to get rid of humans and only have the best or smartest humans be on Earth. The story keeps mentioning reincarnations which might mean if the constellation’s sponsored player has survived the constellation will be able to take that players place on a new Earth that would be home to constellations and other extraterrestrial beings???

10,"Feb 10, 2021",the fact that this webtoon will take ELEVEN DAMN YEARS to finish is sad 😔 (The novel has 550 chapters and around 50 chapters get uploaded every year)

10,"Nov 10, 2021","There is a high chance that atleast the former military guy, his female coworker, and Kim are going to survive for the next 2 to 5 episodes.  As for the boss, due to his type of personality, I do not think he is going to survive for long.  Lastly, I think the TWSA creator is the 3rd constellation option out of the four that was given to Kim.  "
10,"Apr 30, 2021",The drawings are soo incredible just wow

10,"Oct 1, 2020","I wonder when there won't be comments talking about how they spent coins, guaranteeing how good the series will be, or saying that they are hooked on the story.

10,"Mar 4, 2021",I can’t imagine the protagonist is necessarily evil in the book so why don’t we want to meet him? Then again he did team up with the psycho kid

10,"Apr 15, 2021","I'm not sure how to use coins, but from my understanding, you can get 'fast passes' to go through the story instead of waiting weeks for the next episode to come. Is this correct?"
10,"Apr 7, 2021","The ""canon protagonist"" seems tobe a very intense person, combined with the fact that he teamed up with edgelord... there might be a reason why no one else wanted to keeping reading"

10,"Apr 26, 2021",The story has to be really well written for him to be able to imagine everything so vividly how it's going to happen. 
10,"Apr 26, 2021","""It worked! it really worked!!!"" AWWWWW 💖 that puppy eyes 😂"
10,"Apr 26, 2021",how can something be so cute but terrifying at the same time. my dude reminds me of monokuma

10,"Nov 30, 2020",OMG. Imma have a heart attack in every epeisode of this webtoon. SRSLY.
10,"Nov 5, 2020","I like the favt that the protagonist is an anti-hero (not Dokja, the ""real"" protagonist). It would be super tough to make it out if that scenario without killing someone and so the author didn't make the protagonist put to be some saint or rare genius that can handle pressure well (like Donna who I now aspire to be)"
10,"Nov 5, 2020","Can we give a hand to how talented the Auther is, they must have worked really hard on this series."
10,"Oct 27, 2020",Ok but the Dokkaebi is kinda cute

10,"Sep 24, 2020","Oh my god I love this :D It's like Dice at it's best with some hardcore leveling warrior and rebirth, idk honestly it's just amazingnow that I fast passed it'll be a long wait tho ;-;"
10,"Sep 24, 2020",I used my fast pass because I didn't want to end on a cliffhanger.....................look where that got me
10,"Sep 23, 2020",When you spend fast pass to get rid of a cliffhanger but you get a worse one
10,"Sep 23, 2020",I wish this were a graphic novel series then I could just read the whole thing in one go

10,"Sep 17, 2020",My money went to -0 real quick
10,"Sep 16, 2020",Coming from just reading the novel because of how good the first few chapters of this were. And back to the comic seeing the characters so different in the later moments is so weird. 
10,"Sep 15, 2020","Dang it. Now I have to wait 22 days for me to get the next episode, cuz I used up all my coins.😑"
10,"Sep 12, 2020",Welp this is as far as i can go with my coins.Sad
10,"Sep 10, 2020","I keep using my coins but my strength isnt increasing, this apocalypse needed more bug testing.."

10,"Aug 30, 2020",I'm from the ■■■ and this is definitely going to be one hell of a ride.
10,"Aug 30, 2020",I’m gonna Pat for every single chapter 😘
10,"Aug 29, 2020",is this how 2020 ends?

10,"Aug 26, 2020",I used up my coins OMG... This is so good
10,"Aug 26, 2020",Really spent my coins to read early and now that I’m here I still have to wait 😭
10,"Aug 26, 2020",its a cool idea that by entering the story you create a new protagonist and in turn the old one becomes a potential antagonist.
10,"Aug 26, 2020",I started reading so I could get some free coin but I ended up spending coins it was so good 
10,"Aug 26, 2020",only downfall about fast past is that if you dont stay consistent your waiting months just to see the next chapter😂
10,"Aug 26, 2020","It's can't be any worse right?Later:difficulty raises
Sh*t"
10,"Aug 26, 2020",I’m ready for it to be next week so I can spend more HHHH

And i'm still wondering who made the book ""Three ways to survive the apocalypse"" was it the fluffy dude that I forgot the name of and how to spell it."

10,"Oct 1, 2020",idk but this webtoons is pretty behind. read well past this and the 7 other chapters on another site.  
10,"Oct 1, 2020","wow this translation is sooooo far behind everywhere else. too bad, i wouldn't mind reading it here."

10,"Sep 30, 2020",I honestly thought dokja was the protagonist in the novel he's readin
10,"Sep 30, 2020",I honestly am enjoying this webtoon way to much. thank you
10,"Sep 30, 2020",And that is the telltale signs that they’ll get separated here 😞
10,"Sep 30, 2020","Hmmmm the interface knows he’s gained that guys trust. Wouldn’t that mean that the system can mind read on some level and therefore shouldn’t his motives be exposed? I dunno sometimes I think the whole reputation system needs to be left out of novels. When your character changes someone else’s opinion try and express it like a person would rather than spoon feeding us their thoughts, for me it makes side characters less real."
10,"Sep 30, 2020","I know there’s not many people here who know much about prehistoric animals, but COME on that thing is clearly not an Ichthyosaur. I mean quick google search would have revealed that Ichthyosaur are not giant snakes. Hell they’re not even closely related totally different taxanomical groups. Oh well I’m still gonna read it but I’m pissed."

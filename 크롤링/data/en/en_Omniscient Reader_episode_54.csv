Episode,Date,Review
54,"May 12, 2021",Did he just uh merge with Junghyeok Yu? I can confidently say I‚Äôm very confused
54,"May 12, 2021",The big question is whether or not Dokja can actually control Junghyeok or he‚Äôs just watching. 
54,"May 12, 2021","Ooo so basically, Dokja and Junghyeok have a special bond now ;) Edit: Relax, guys! It's not like I said Dokja was INSIDE him or anything!"
54,"May 12, 2021",Meanwhile Dokja‚Äôs charred body is just hanging out in the basement with the dragon lol
54,"May 12, 2021","For anyone who is confused, First reader viewpoint allows Dokja to view the world from any character he chooses but his understanding of that character must be high. He isn't controlling Junghyeok, Hes more so seeing the world through Junghyeok's eyes. "
54,"May 12, 2021",So we are reading the first person point of view of a reader who is ‚Äúreading‚Äù someone‚Äôs first person POV? pov-ception
54,"May 12, 2021","I know it doesn't have much to do with the chapter, but it makes me really happy to be reading such a great story with a great group of constellations like you guys!"
54,"May 12, 2021",Man I hate it when it takes longer to revive than usual. Always annoying when that happens.
54,"May 12, 2021",Protagonist's basic traits: always shows up late and make a cool entrance üëå
54,"May 12, 2021",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' feels like its watching a ghost/thriller movie.] [5 coins have been sponsored.]
54,"May 12, 2021","Apostles: ""Let's go and get Chungmuro"" YJH: ""...So you have chosen death."""
54,"May 12, 2021",Hell of a way to get into your favorite character.
54,"May 12, 2021","PLOT TWIST‚ÄîWHO‚ÄôS THE MAIN CHARACTER nOW, PUNKS!?"
54,"May 12, 2021","Man it was so satisfying when that guy's head got chopped off! My blood was boiling seeing Jihye get treated like that. Loved seeing Dokja's growth when it comes to caring for the ""characters"" of TWSA. He's starting to clearly see them as actual ppl. Also, Sangah! Look at her go being a capable leader! Pildu thinking of his family when he looked at Gilyoung ü•∫"
54,"May 12, 2021","Ah, Sleeping Beauty has finally awakened....  LET THE BLOODBATH BEGIN!!!!"
54,"May 16, 2021","For those who don't understand Dokja was just seeing things from Junghyeok's perspective , so he can see and feel as if he was Junghyeok.Hope this clears things up."
54,"May 12, 2021",HOLY FUCK! I DIDNT EXPECT THAT
54,"May 12, 2021",oh come on! man this is just so well crafted and addictive!
54,"May 12, 2021",I truly didn‚Äôt expect for this comic to be so damn good. I‚Äôm shook right now. Okay does anyone else think that as an omniscient reader Dokja has the ability to identify with each ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù? Or is it just gonna be Junghyeok? 
54,"May 13, 2021","YOU HAVE USED COINS: FUTURE VIEWING ACTIVATED.... FUTURE VIEWING INTERRUPTED DUE TO PROLONGED USE, NO MORE UPDATE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME...COIN SKILL NO LONGER FUNCTIONING......Me:üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ I don't want to wait a week it why I paid üò™"
54,"Jun 23, 2021",When your level of bromance is high enough to literally do the fusion dance
54,"May 12, 2021","jic someone is confused, omniscient reader's viewpoint lvl 3 allows his soul to leave his body when all bonds have been cut (he's dead right now) and wander around or posses a character's body (special conditions,I won't reveal). so yeah, he's basically a ghost rn and can go around possessing people"
54,"May 14, 2021","my take: When she said help me it wasn't to Dokja but to the real Junghyeok that is now awake. Dokja is still responding due to the conflicting skills, but is in spectator mode, feeling what Junghyeok is doing, but not interfering with his body or systems."
54,"May 20, 2021",BETTER THAN SOLO LEVELLING IDC IDC
54,"May 12, 2021",[broke god has donated his college funds]
54,"May 12, 2021","Here is my theory...Junghyeok is one of his ""bookmarks"" right?
Is it possible that his special 4th wall ability allows him to become a character he knows really well? Taking on their strengths?"
54,"May 12, 2021","Ah! Now he's back to viewing as a reader for the time being. He will watch Yu slaughter everyone and save the station, and then resurrect again. Interesting..."
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Hold the phone.... You're telling me dokja never killed anyone? 
54,"May 12, 2021","I like this viewpoint that he has and how it gives him different perspectives, literally."
54,"May 16, 2021",Wow there‚Äôs about 3000 people that have payed or saved up challenge coins just to read in advance ! This story is fantastic and I‚Äôll gladly continue to pay
54,"Jun 24, 2021",I escaped the last cliffhanger with the holy coins just to meet another one.
54,"May 12, 2021","So I just caught this, but Dokja doesn't call Jihye ""just a girl"" in the novel he said she was ""just a character"". He wasn't demeaning her or anything, just conflicted w/ how much he has grown to care for these ""characters"". It's also shown more clearly that he was in control of YJH's body. He literally fanboyed like how his grip on the sword was strange, yet natural & beautiful üòÖ Edit: My bad, I was wrong. Dokja had no control & could only look & feel thru YJH's perspective"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",the last scene when Jihye plopped her head on Junghyeok's leg.... ü•∫ü•∫. he actually cared...I thought he was a bastard with no humanity... this is sweet. 
54,"May 12, 2021","Ohhh, the chapter‚Äôs title was ‚ÄúMain Character First Person POV,‚Äù which is why Dojka merged with Junghyeok Yu, so that he could read the story through 1st personüëÅüëÉüëÅ"
54,"Jun 30, 2021","I personally think Dokja is just along for the ride inside Junghyeok's pov and not controlling him. Dokja is literally an omniscient reader after all, so it wouldn't be a stretch for him to be able to spectate other's povs with that reader's viewpoint skill. tbh, dokja's skills are very straightforwardly named lol xD"
54,"Jun 23, 2021",WOOOO HES BACK HIS BOYFRIEND IS BACK
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Okay, I have to give this chapter credit where credit is due: I've been reading Webtoons for a long time. I've read so many, for as long as I can remember I've just ascended from feeling cliffhangers. I'm a patient person, I can wait, no plot has ever compelled me to 'sit on the edge of my seat' waiting for more. But this chapter? Is the first time in ages I've been absolutely FLOORED by a cliffhanger. It straight up tossed me off a building, I've been THAT floored. Amazing. Love this story."
54,"May 13, 2021","oh yes, fans who haven't read the novel, please don't search this up on Pinterest. unless you love spoilers, confusion and depression üòó"
54,"May 12, 2021",Dont you guys love it when nothing makes sense :)
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Oh I get it....Third Person View. Seeing it all laid out at once. First Person View...from the eyes of another.
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Guess that all of Dokja‚Äôs practice with pretending to be Junghyeok is gonna pay off now
54,"May 12, 2021",This is insane. I‚Äôm guessing without his body his soul can inhabit any character that he has proficient knowledge on
54,"Jun 30, 2021",So my first thought was that Dokja turned into Junghyeok Yu but then I thought about it a little and it makes more sense that Junghyeok just woke up and Dokja is just seeing the events from his point of view
54,"Jun 30, 2021","For everyone confused: part of KDJs ‚Äúomniscient readers viewpoint‚Äù skill allows him to take over the body of a character. So he hasn‚Äôt ‚Äúbecome YJH‚Äù really, he‚Äôs just part of his conciseness and is seeing through his eyes or is in control of him for a temporary amount of time. He can use this skill on other characters too"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Dokja really just hitting that spectate button while waiting to respawn
54,"Jun 30, 2021","this first and third person view reminds me of those shooting games when a player died. He has to wait until respawn and while he is waiting, he became a spectator, watching his teammates or enemies game play in different person point of views/perspectives. "
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Jihye mouthing ""help me"" was so haunting :(( no one hurts Jihye and gets away with it!"
54,"Jun 24, 2021",The King of no killing really makes more sense now that conditions of that path has been announced. 
54,"May 19, 2021","Oh my.. I didn‚Äôt expect the ‚Äò1st apostle‚Äô to be this good looking tbh, Lemon lollipop has good tastes üòâ"
54,"May 16, 2021",I can see our disaster trio amassing... H‚óæÔ∏èS‚óæÔ∏èY‚óæÔ∏è is gonna be great
54,"Jun 23, 2021",Dokja really out here getting the best experience of his favorite novel. I mean come on SEEING WHAT HIS FAVORITE NOVEL'S CHARACTER IS SEEING IN FIRST PERSON???? 
54,"Jun 30, 2021",huh. So the story revolves around Junghyeok. Normally Dokja is in omniscient reader second person. When he was in ghost mode he was in third person. And now he's in first person mode. Maybe he'll soon be able to switch between the viewpoints freely. 
54,"Jun 30, 2021",I am Junghyeok Yu. You destroyed my base. Prepare to die. (two references in one)
54,"Jun 30, 2021","I feel almost certain that the disciple king is another Dokja that came from another world. Same hair color, same(ish) face, same eye color, and same knowledge."
54,"Jun 30, 2021","For you guys who confuse, this is what happen in webnovel:...I was really in Chungmuro.
‚Ä¶How? Lee Jihye was looking at me with shaky eyes. It wasn‚Äôt just her. At this moment, everyone on the platform was watching me.
My field of view moved slowly. I walked towards Lee Jihye. To be exact, my body was moving regardless of my will.
One step, another step. Slowly but steadily, I was closing the distance to her.
The 7th Apostle frowned and asked, ‚ÄúYou are‚Ä¶?‚Äù
I was uncomfortable, like I was wearing-"
54,"Jul 4, 2021",I swear to god if this masterpiece doesn't get the anime it very much deserves I WILL be throwing hands.
54,"Jun 30, 2021",I missed Dokja's face ü•∞ (Disciples 1 and 4 have no right to be good-looking for peeps about to die ü§öüíÄ)
54,"May 13, 2021",So he can use his Omniscient Reader skill to take over the main characters first person view?!?!? 
54,"Jun 30, 2021",o... fxck... junghyeok *is* dokja... immortal king is the skill that starts the regressions... 
54,"Jul 8, 2021","basically, his POV shifted to ""first person"" meaning he is now seeing things from the pov of the main characters of the novel"
54,"Jul 6, 2021",Bro did mc just become the mc???
54,"Jul 6, 2021",‚Ä¶power couple?
54,"Jul 1, 2021","Guess: it says ""1st person mode"" he is still a spectator but due to ""increased immersion"" he is now watching through the eyes of the ""main protagonist"""
54,"Jul 1, 2021","You guys, first person view means you‚Äôre seeing everything from the perspective of a character. When you read a book you‚Äôre not controlling the characters, just observing. "
54,"Jun 30, 2021","He didnt merge with him, i think, he is seeing his viewpoint, personally. Like when u read something u really immerse yourself with, u suddenly feel like the person himself and feels like he is you, u resonate with what he feels but reality speaking, no. Dokja is a reader, and is resonating deeply right now i think with junghyuk's (correct me for the spelling pls!) feelings as someone who sees the event, considering he reads the whole novel, dokja knows junghyuk well. ü§îü§î"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",When you switch to your op account.
54,"Jun 30, 2021",GOD THAT WAS SO SEXY!!
54,"Jun 30, 2021",disciple IV has some great fashion sense. i mean the cape??? thighs knife holder??? dude really dressing up in the middle of apocalypse
54,"Jun 30, 2021","so thats what all this build up has been leading to!!!!!!!! it makes sense tho, theyre both the protagonist so it makes sense if dokja has special reader skills he could merge w junhyeok since generally in fiction, the protag is written for the reader to relate to, and that way the protagonist discrepancy gets resolved.... but also i agree w the top comment, it's important to know if he can control him or just share his viewpoint"
54,"Jun 30, 2021","my interpretation is that he did indeed merge with Junghyeok's senses, but he's not the one in control. That might just be Junghyeok himself."
54,"Jun 16, 2021",ok but like imagine the others must be freaking out over dokja's dead body rn lol
54,"May 12, 2021",Why does the new the leader of the bad guys look kinda like our main character Dokja 
54,"May 12, 2021",those idiots got themselves in the Den of the Wolves without making sure if their info was accurate and now they would die like the idiots they are
54,"Jul 8, 2021","seriously why doesn't this webtoon have +99,999 likes"
54,"Jul 7, 2021","it makes sense. out of all the characters in TWSA, The character that Dokja Understands the best is Junghyeok Yu. this plus ""omniscient readers viewpoint"" allows Dokja to see and feel exactly what Junghyeok does"
54,"Jul 2, 2021","can we talk about Jihye? Poor girl, I'm glad that Junghyeok has arrived. Also, Sangah was so cool leader "
54,"Jun 30, 2021",The webtoon adaptation is great but I wish they would change immortal king to king of no killing and disciples to prophets
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Oooooohhhhhhhhh. I get it. He's the ""Omniscient Reader"" so he can see through anyone's eyes. Think about it. Fourth Wall, knowing the story, seeing through Jungheok Yu, it all makes sense, but he needs to separate his consciousness from his body because when you read something you aren't actually there in the story, but your mind is. I could be wrong but I think I see what's going on here"
54,"May 15, 2021","Disciples be like: ""This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!"""
54,"May 12, 2021",NEED more episodes.... I am too invested into this... pretty please take my money as an offering so I can read more..
54,"May 12, 2021","If my calculations are right, if Junghyeok is main character and Dokja= Jungheok, Dokja is main character "
54,"Jul 7, 2021","also can we appreciate Sangah, Pildu, Jihye!?!?!!"
54,"Jul 1, 2021","Readers are so confused. His skill omniscient reader leveled up, meaning, he can now see and feel the first point of view of the character and that is Junghyeok Yu   :3
he's in the first point of view of Junghyeok Yu"
54,"Jun 30, 2021","I WAS GOING THROUGH KOREAN WIKI OF ORV AND ITS STATED THERE THAT ""Anime rights from the omniscient reader's point of view have been sold. However, in interviews, hundreds of episodes are planned, but these days, there are no cases of making hundreds of them, whether It is Japanese or American.Other than that the production company has not been disclosed, so it is unclear whether animation has been decided yet."" 
.... EITHER WAY HOPING FOR THE BEST"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",If Dokya as a reader is behind the forth wall. Are we behind the fifth? 
54,"Jun 30, 2021",And that's the moment that they knew that they F**k up really bad
54,"Jun 30, 2021","my guess is that once his understanding of each character raises he'll be able to take control of them as well, just gotta get the badass first time reveal as the OP Protagonist of the world out if the way first"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",But I still want to see Dokja's body please don't remove his own being from the story üò¢
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Yaaaay there finally at this part
54,"Jun 30, 2021",This cliffhanger is ILLEGAL
54,"Jun 30, 2021",AHHH I'M BOTH CONFUSED YET I FEEL LIKE I UNDERSTAND. MAN YES GO KICK THEIR ASSES HOW DARE THEY HURT JIHYE LEE. ALSO THE BABY WAS THERE AND Y'ALL PROBABLY HURT HIM SO NOW YA GOTTA DIE.
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Since Junghyeok Yu is still unconscious, Dokja immerse into Junghyeok's body!!! This is getting truly exciting!"
54,"Jun 24, 2021",I DIDN‚ÄôT SPEND COINS JUST TO BE LEFT ON ANOTHER CLIFFHANGER!! I NEED MORE!!
54,"Jun 23, 2021",Whose gonna fast pass again because they are really confusedüôãüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
54,"May 19, 2021",This is what happens when you get absorbed into reading. You go from reading about the main character to becoming the main character! 
54,"May 12, 2021","So the person who's claiming to be the #1 apostle is a fake, right? Because KDJ is #1. But then, what # is he? We saw apostles 2-9, which means that he's either a super low ranking apostle or an entirely fake apostle (as either option, he shouldn't have had the ability to convince the other apostle apostle he is #1, right????)"
54,"Jun 30, 2021","The four types of point of view are - First person: the character is in the story. Second person: the story is told to you. Third person (limited): The narrator is outside the story and relating the experiences of the characters. Third person (omniscient): the narrator has full access to the thoughts and experiences of all characters in the story. Dokja went from an omniscient pov to a first person pov, does that mean he won‚Äôt be able to access ppl‚Äôs feelings and thoughts while on this pov?"
54,"Jul 9, 2021","dokja really said: ""I am de captain now"""
54,"Jul 5, 2021",let me explain in a simpler term. Dokja is watching a 4D movie with Junghyeok's perspective
54,"Jul 2, 2021","Congratulations, Dokja! You've been promoted to MC! Now go off and save the world! Or at least your little corner of it."
54,"Jul 2, 2021",Dokja has become one of us. JOIN THE VIEWERS! ONE OF US! ONE OF US!
54,"Jul 2, 2021",He is omniscient reader and he just changed his viewpoint
54,"Jul 1, 2021","Don‚Äôt worry guys, Dokja is just as confused as we are üòî"
54,"Jul 1, 2021","I haven‚Äôt read the webnovel but I think what happened was that Dokja is now out of his own body and instead he gained access to Junghyeok Yu‚Äôs senses. So it‚Äôs not him, he is just experiencing the story in first person, not controlling him"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",okay this was one of the best endings of a chapter
54,"Jun 30, 2021","looking at all the comments saying dokja and junghyeok are the same person lmaooo it literally said his ""omniscient reader's viewpoint"" skill is changing to first person, he's basically just seeing and feeling the same things junghyeok is"
54,"Jun 30, 2021","THOSE WHO DIDNT GET IT: using his special skill, dokja now is experiencing things from a FIRST PERSON POV. He's not physically present in Chungmuro or anything, he's just watching/experiencing things the way the real Yu Jungkyeok is doing"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",JUNGHYEOK IS AWAKE??? OOOOOm
54,"Jun 30, 2021","How can there be another person who read the whole book when i remember the first chapter, literally the day of the apocalypse, he was still the lone reader that completed the book wtf"
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Don't scroll too much down the comments' section, I saw a spoiler. There may be more"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",When you haven't killed anyone? How is that possible? Dokja hasn't killed any humans or has he not killed any humans since this scenario started?
54,"Jun 30, 2021",And that‚Äôs when they knew they fucked up
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Pildu is like a full team of Lv. 3 Engineers.
54,"Jun 30, 2021",It's like Dokja is in his mind? This webtoon just amaze me more and more
54,"Jun 25, 2021",So I got 5 coins just to be left on a cliffhanger!? 
54,"Jun 24, 2021","By his reactions and thoughts I think Dokja is watching, but notice how he has the broken faith weapon. He is either 1. Watching Junghyeok Yu 2. Merged with Junghyeok Yu, which might mean A) he is fully controlling him B) half controlling him or C) Inputting thoughts into his mind, like a little voice - or 3. Is disguised as Junghyeok Yu/has created his own brand of Junghyeok Yu as the only finisher of TWSA, like a cool little ""um actually-"" I have watched the protagonist and have a special bond"
54,"Jun 17, 2021",This man literally just became the Main Character for real
54,"May 18, 2021","OMG guys! I checked the first chapter again and saw the writter of ""Ways of Survival"" has the name tls123! If I'm right then that might be an acronym for The Last Survivor. Question is, who is this ""last survivor""? Could it be Dokja, Junghyeok Yu or someone else? I'm genuinely interested to find out."
54,"May 12, 2021","LOVED THIS CHAPTER amazing to see the evolution of him caring about the people he's seen as characters grow into affection for them as people, man I hope in the end his team's know its Dokja and not give Junghyeok Yu the credit"
54,"Aug 20, 2021","Dokja be like... Steal your name,
steal your face
now steal your body lol
"
54,"Jul 20, 2021",i‚Äôm gonna cum
54,"Jul 9, 2021",Dokja really just unlocked spectator mode
54,"Jul 9, 2021",and that's why I let these episodes pile up
54,"Jul 6, 2021",I‚Äôm convinced that half of the people were waiting for the apocalypse when they can finally go all out and wear all those fancy clothes üòÇ
54,"Jul 3, 2021",THIS COMIC IS INSANEEE!! üòÆüòÆüî•
54,"Jul 2, 2021","Can't be Dokja because he has the attribute of Immortal King so long as he doesn't kill anyone, which he would have violated right there if that was him. I agree with the Junghyeok Yu theory of Dokja being present thru Yu's consciousness."
54,"Jul 1, 2021",[About to lose 25 coins due to increased immersion]
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Dokja took impersonation to a whole new level 
54,"Jun 30, 2021","i think he can take the perspective of other characters, like when picking a character for the game, he can do that now"
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Ah, I love the webnovel so much and this webtoon is almost perfect too! Dokja finally unlocked the King of No Killing attribute (I stand by my point that it sounds way better than Immortal King) AND his 1st Person Viewpoint! He‚Äôs becoming the awesome character he is later already!"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Y‚Äôall know how Sweet Home was made into a television series? Omniscient Reader is something I REALLY want to see as a series. Imagine the action scenes on the screen!
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Do u ever do catch up and ur rly glad u don't have to wait for cliff hangers but when u finally get to the latest ep it's the worst of all the cliff hangers?


Cause that *always* happens to me"
54,"Jun 30, 2021","I 100% have believed from the beginning that Junghyeok is just a future Dokja. Like, Dokja will regress over and over again sort of thing, and slowly but surely become Junghyeok to the point where he no longer remembers being Dokja"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Dokja is just viewing from Junghyeok's viewpoint. Also Sangah has control over Junghyeok lol. Also I wonder if anyone who doesn't fast pass at all has ever gotten top comment on a popular webtoon.
54,"Jun 30, 2021",No Dokja is the READER. Notice how in books when you read the tone changes from third person to first person? Basically he is a speculator but is adapating the feelings of the character in the book. This is due to his ability developing.
54,"Jun 30, 2021","‚Ä¢ I am so Hyped right now before telling u guys ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Ä¢ I just completed reading Light Novel, you guys will not believe what happen in end and why this all started... 
‚Ä¢ Damn wish this Webtoon to complete till all chapters 551... 
‚Ä¢ (Do u guys know that - One chapter of Webtoon is equal to One chapter of Light Novel) 
‚Ä¢ So their will be 551 Chapters of Webtoon..."
54,"Jun 30, 2021","I loved this chapter, also it really shows how much he cares for the characters, and not just viewing them as Characters, but as real people"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",I‚Äôm pretty sure Dojka is viewing everything from Junghyeok‚Äôs point of view. Kind of like if he was reading a novel from his point
54,"Jun 30, 2021",The main character.. became the main character..?
54,"Jun 30, 2021",No clue what just happened but damn this is cool ü§Ø
54,"Jun 30, 2021","TWAS is written in Junghyeok Yu's viewpoint so the new skill activated changed Dokja's viewpiont to be Junghyeok's, like he changed from a reader to the protagonist? "
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Change of POV. I was wondering why that was part of this chapter 
54,"Jun 30, 2021",THIS CLIFFHANGERS ARE TOO ILLEGAL
54,"Jun 30, 2021",The think Dokja is not controlling but seeing from Junghyeok Yu's eyes.
54,"Jun 30, 2021",hahaha i knew in the twsa final Dokja fight vs Dokja hahaha this is the truly regression
54,"Jun 30, 2021",I know I wait for the episode but in wait for the comments too . you guys just increase the spiciness of the comic. love you all guysüòçüòç
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Uhh, wait, what??? "
54,"Jun 30, 2021",ah so that's the child jihye said
54,"Jun 30, 2021",This is now my favourite Webtoon
54,"Jun 30, 2021","AE I just binged this entire Webtoon in two days and I must say I am HOOKED. The author has managed to write a real true neutral character, compared to some other webtoons. I love the way the story is progressing and the choices the mc makes, it‚Äôs always something new and brilliant I couldn‚Äôt have seen coming. The art and storyline is amazing, keep up the good work author!!"
54,"Jun 30, 2021","[The constellation ""Emo Reader"" screams in multiple different emotions]"

54,"Jun 30, 2021",?!?!??!?!?!?!?!???!!???

54,"Jun 30, 2021",Right now they literally are... 2 souls in one body üòè
54,"Jun 30, 2021",that last part was confusing but kinda hot tbh üôè
54,"Jun 30, 2021",I HAVE A THEORY! OUR MAIN CHARACTER IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN THE MANGAS MAIN CHARACTER! This is the ACTUAL manga! HE IS A CHARACTER TOO!
54,"Jun 30, 2021",He's literally having a First Person Main Character POV  
54,"Jun 26, 2021","Dokja: I may have said, and pretended that I was Junghyeok Yu, but I didn't mean it LITERALLY!!!"
54,"Jun 23, 2021",gd I fast passed into another cliff hanger
54,"Jun 16, 2021","I AM SCREAMING AT THIS DEVELOPMENT, IM SO OBSESSED WITH THIS SERIES RN THIS IS INSANE THESE LAST FEW CHAPTERS HAVE BEEN CRAAAAAAAAZYYYYY"
54,"Jun 16, 2021",i don't have free coins anymore ü•∫ it was worth spending all the coins here
54,"May 14, 2021","First, Dokja is definitely in a cheatmode HAHA. Second, the copy of TWSA is a start booster. Third, How come Dokja read TWSA until the end while hating the protagonist and (i think) not wanting to be in his body?"
54,"May 12, 2021","I wonder if that counted as him killing someone...will he lose the immortal king attribute? or does the attribute only count if its his physical body that does the killing.
also yes, kill the scummmmmmm"
54,"May 12, 2021",When there‚Äôs no more episodes to fast pass because you read them all and the week of waiting has just restarted üíÄüò§
54,"May 12, 2021",Awaiting the inevitable arrival of the Constellation [Lazy Broke Weeb]
54,"May 12, 2021","I don‚Äôt think they merged, just his ability is able to see things in third person (which is why he was floating around at first) and then it increased to first person which means he would see things from that person‚Äôs view/body. This is so hype!!"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",plot twist dokja is the creador of twsa 
54,"Jun 30, 2021","I can confidently say a majority of fans are shipping Dokja and Junghjeok. It‚Äôs pretty funny, bet author didn‚Äôt see this turn of events.  "
54,"Aug 20, 2021",i seriously love Sangah very much
54,"Aug 5, 2021",first person point of view... so he became the main character!   can he go back to being himself though? tune in next time!
54,"Jul 30, 2021",okay... now Dokja doesn't have to pretend to be Junghyeok Yu; He can now basically just be on Junghyeok Yu's First-person POV and be technically him. ksksksksksk
54,"Jul 7, 2021",Dokja‚Äôs inside him üòè
54,"Jul 6, 2021","since I don't see anyone mentioned this, I will~ Disciple 4 dude maybe a bad guy but artist really have to go and make him look so damn fine with that cape and all~ If bad guy, why hot????"
54,"Jul 5, 2021","I just realized that being called samurai while being korean is offensive, I did not put two and two together so I didn't understand at first"
54,"Jul 5, 2021",I really Appreciate this series I Look forward to coming episodes! ‚ú®
54,"Jul 4, 2021","I think Dokja Kim and Junghyeok Yu are the same person because of this‚Ä¶. I have not read ahead whatsoever, this is a theory, please don‚Äôt tell me what happens."
54,"Jul 3, 2021",It just came to me a thought that I had some chapters ago...so Dokja and the others (characters not in the novel) are experimenting Junghyeok Yu's third regression because TWSA starts narrating from the third regression and putting flashbacks of the first and seconde ones? Why is the third regression important? I have so many questions! And the king of recessors who knows all TWSA like Dokja is the author himself? If they are not lying then the only one could be the author. But then again why g-
54,"Jul 3, 2021",so basically dokja get the first person experience of jungeok Yu 
54,"Jul 2, 2021",Dokja may have always been Yu he just doesn‚Äôt realize because it‚Äôs his ‚Äúfirst‚Äù regression.
54,"Jul 2, 2021",what if Junghyeok Yu gets erased and Dokja becomes his character 
54,"Jul 2, 2021","ok, i understand after reading the comments: dokja shifted to first perspn, seeing through the lenses of junghyeok, and junghyeok was the one the girl was whispering to. junghyeok didnt magically teleport in, he was walking in, but from our pov dokja was covering him. also i am not like officially simping for junghyeoküò´üò´"
54,"Jul 2, 2021","hmm, methinks Gong Pildu has a tragic backstory? üòî also since dokja was fried by the dragon, what about his phone?!"
54,"Jul 2, 2021",Grampa Pildu. :)
54,"Jul 2, 2021",Why is dokja so hot when he‚Äôs pissed off? üòç 
54,"Jul 2, 2021","I am so confused but I'm not gonna question, Imma just wait in the background"
54,"Jul 1, 2021","Can't believe I have to wait a whole WEEK to see this play out...

54,"Jul 1, 2021",Y O U  M E S S  W I T H  T H E  W R O N G  G U Y.
54,"Jul 1, 2021",Can he change the POV and take other body??
54,"Jul 1, 2021",This really just takes breaking the fourth wall to a whole new level
54,"Jul 1, 2021",Finally! Enjoyed the manhwa so much that I've read the light novel. Guess that makes me a Dokja
54,"Jul 1, 2021",As a German i feel the strong News to say... it is Hameln not Hamelin Hameln is a real City and the Legend is based there
54,"Jul 1, 2021","I feel like everytime it says ‚Äúincrease immersion‚Äù it means that Dojka is genuinely starting to care about the ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù as real people, not just beings he read about in a book. He‚Äôs becoming more ‚Äúimmersed‚Äù in this world as a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù himself, no longer just as a reader. "
54,"Jul 1, 2021",it's just a first person pov so maybe he can't control the body?
54,"Jul 1, 2021",bruh i literally finished writing about the pied piper of hamelin and now the flute of hamelin?
54,"Jul 1, 2021","JAJAJA we are the ""wall"" he refered to"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",I just binged all 53 episodes and I am not disappointed
54,"Jun 30, 2021",This webtoon is going to be the end of me. It's sooooooooooooooooo freaking amazing !!!!!!!!!!
54,"Jun 30, 2021","oH Its because Junghyeok Yu is the protagonist of the story, so when he switched to first person he was viewing everything from Junghyeok's POV."
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Oh boy, did you guys pick the wrong station to mess with üòÇ"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Man just unlocked spectator mode
54,"Jun 30, 2021","I kind of want to be mad at the realization that Dokja has actually managed to somehow just barely sidestep actually KILLING anyone with his own hands this whole time. He's maimed people and he's certainly sentenced others to their deaths even if he wasn't directly driving the knife through their hearts, but... NOPE! He has managed to get this far without actually killing a single person by his own hands."
54,"Jun 30, 2021","holy sh*t, this is crazy he changed POV and became the main character. thank goodness Junghyeok was there! explains how Dokja ""teleported"" answer: he didnt!"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",HOW IS A COMIC THIS EXCITING TO READ AHHHH
54,"Jun 30, 2021","jihye tearing up in relief when she saw junghyeok, yup there goes my heart"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",So omniscient reader‚Äôs viewpoint is‚Ä¶being able to see the story through the eyes of a character? Literally?
54,"Jun 30, 2021","People who are confused about the skill, think of it as you reading a story from a certain point of view. A story written in third person POV means you're seeing the story unfold from an outsider's perspective. If it is written in first person POV, it means you're reading the story from one of the characters perspective. This skill of Dokja is EXACTLY like that but in real life form. His consciousness is there based on the POV. (not a spoiler, his skills just have a lot to do with readers). "
54,"Jun 30, 2021",I kinda shipped jung and dokja but.... this works too! 
54,"Jun 30, 2021",this was definitely worth the wait.

54,"Jun 30, 2021","I think that within the book, first person pov was through Junghyeok as the protagonist. Now that Dokja has become the Immortal King, he is merging with the first person pov aka Junghyeok. With the varying regressions Junghyeok goes through, the reader who makes it all the way through the story becomes the protagonist. Therefore, Junghyeok and Dokja have always been one and the same. "
54,"Jun 30, 2021","First person POV, that's a cool ability Also, I guess Dokja technically didn't kill the guy whose arm he cut off if Huiwon was the one to activate Judgement Time and kill them all off. So yeah, he technically hasn't killed anyone yet."
54,"Jun 30, 2021",i hope its actually junghyeok yu. i think it'd be more interesting if its actually him doing it and dokja is just an observer 
54,"Jun 30, 2021","all I can say is ""I'm speechless ""."
54,"Jun 30, 2021",One word: GOOSEBUMPS
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Lol, the beginning of the first person POV!"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",So can Junghyeok feel him inside or is his presence too small‚Ä¶

54,"May 12, 2021",Ok so from what I understand (which isn't much because I've not read the novel) is that immortal king put him in a state of suspension and Omniscient readers view point let him watch ehats goin in. when the forth wall got weaker he could see from Jungheok Yu's View? Maybe forth Wall stops him using Omniscient Reader's view to its full potential and he can override forth wall when he needs to? Does that make any sense?
54,"May 12, 2021","Does anyone else think #1 looks like Dokja?! I'm wondering if maybe there's a split personality/evil twin thing going on, seeing as there can't be TWO people who've read all of twsa. (and they spent an awful amount of time keeping his face hidden...)"

I Love This Sooooooooooooooooo Much!!!!!üíôüíô!"
54,"May 14, 2021",I don‚Äôt think they merged. I think Dojka is in something akin to spectator mode
54,"May 13, 2021",Ahhh I want Wednesday to come ASAP!! Gonna re-read until then üíï
54,"May 13, 2021",Free in 48 da-Me: Yeah no. 5coins.
54,"May 12, 2021",Take my coins! You've done an amazing storyline and I can't wait for the upcoming episodes. Just... Take all my coins! 
54,"May 12, 2021","Somebody call Keanu Reeves, my boi dokja blasting thru the matrix"
54,"May 12, 2021",Thia webtoon just continually gets better and better. big thanks to the author and artists for all their hard work!
54,"May 12, 2021","Srsly, this webtoon doesn't stop getting better."
54,"May 12, 2021",Did anybody get chills at the end
54,"May 12, 2021",He probably cant control his body yet but i think he can see other peoples pov.
54,"May 12, 2021",I can't even manage to properly articulate how irritated these cliffhangers make me!!! üò§üò°üò´
54,"May 12, 2021",if you are confused...just think of FPS games. When you die you change into your teammates point of view(spectator mode). In Dokja's case he can also sense everything. 
54,"May 12, 2021",STUPID CLIFFHANGER! AHHHHHHHHHHHH I WANNA SEE THEM FIGHT! üò°
54,"Jun 30, 2021",he switched to first person pov when he was originally just a character himselfü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø
54,"Jun 30, 2021","so...is the king of the disciples impersonating dokja? they look terribly similar and previously a renouncer mentioned that the ""king"" had read to the end, which he probably hasn't and is just pretending to be dokja, who had."
54,"Sep 19, 2021",I think he‚Äôs dokja is just watching junghyeok through his eyes And feeling what he feelsHence the ‚Äúfirst person pov‚Äù
54,"Aug 20, 2021",poor Gilyoung who woke up in a panic
54,"Aug 14, 2021",Dokja is in spectator mode from Yu's point of view
54,"Aug 4, 2021",lmao dokja on junghyuk's pov and we are on dokja's pov ü§£ there's only one difference that dokja can feel him but we don't üòÇ
54,"Jul 24, 2021",POV: You're the main character.
54,"Jul 23, 2021",BROOOOO THAT SIDE CHARACTER IS SO HOT THE ONE WEARING HALF BLAZER 
54,"Jul 22, 2021",i fuckin love this series
54,"Jul 22, 2021","WAIT, WAAAAIT DID DOKJA‚Äî ARE THEY BOTH LIKE MERGED?????"
54,"Jul 16, 2021",This comic is so epic and has so much potential to become an anime or live action film series. Preferably anime but that‚Äôs besides the point. I can‚Äôt be the only one thinking this!!! This chapter alone just proved it. 
54,"Jul 10, 2021",HMM this is kinda confusing but since it said it was the first person view(?) he might just be watching from Junghyeok's viewpoint
54,"Jul 9, 2021",OUR POWER COUPLE IS BACK!!!!
54,"Jul 9, 2021",GUYSSSSSS MY THEORY IS SEEMINGLY BECOMING TRUE!!!!! Dokja IS the author of TWSA!!! He practically changed reality and therefore changed the story!!!
54,"Jul 8, 2021",Ok but I gotta say THAT DUDE IN THE CLOAK IS JUST üòç
54,"Jul 8, 2021",Help i love this ep
54,"Jul 8, 2021",every episode of this webtoon is fantastic
54,"Jul 7, 2021",Oh shoot so his omniscient skill allows him to embody characters at will now? So he can not only observe but interact??? WHAT.
54,"Jul 7, 2021",y'know I'm waiting for the last eps of this comic...especially chapter 546(epilogue 5 part 1) of novel..... its gonna take a really long time for it to be finished right?!might take 2 or 3 years..I'll be waiting till its end!
54,"Jul 6, 2021",POV: you're junghyeok yu (or should I say ur inside him ;) )
54,"Jul 6, 2021",I NEED MORE.... HAHAHA ok but did he just actaully become... the main character 
54,"Jul 4, 2021","They game really just said 'eh he's invested, let's just make him the MC for a bit!' ü§öüòì"
54,"Jul 4, 2021",*intense yu-gi-oh flash backs
54,"Jul 4, 2021",what the f*ck just happened
54,"Jul 3, 2021",This chapter gave me chills holy shit LMAO
54,"Jul 3, 2021",This is really hard to followToo complicated skill effect
54,"Jul 3, 2021",ugh this webtoon has such good cliffhangers I NEED MORE
54,"Jul 3, 2021","Ooooohhh so he's basically feeling what its like to be the main character! I think when Jihye said ""help me"" Dokja can hear her because he's still the reader. Like if you read the sentence '""Help me,"" she mouthed.' You know what she's trying to say. But in this case he's the reader experiencing the novel first hand as the main character :OO Interesting..."
54,"Jul 2, 2021",Omg THIS IS SO FREAKING AWESOME 
54,"Jul 2, 2021",OH MY GOD FALLS IN LOVE EYES BULDGE OUT OF MY HEAD
54,"Jul 2, 2021",Is it just me or does the first panel DOKJA LOOKS LIKE JUNGHYOK YU?!
54,"Jul 2, 2021","I'm guessing that since he's a rwader, he can possess main characters,,cuz like, when u read books, you sometimes imagine yourself in the main/fav character's shoes, right? and since you is the main character and i think dokja's fav character, that's probably why he can possess him"
54,"Jul 2, 2021",I- whait what happens I‚Äôm very confused üòï is he possessing him? I can‚Äôt wait 
54,"Jul 2, 2021","This is basically Dokja switched to ""Spectate"" mode and I love it "
54,"Jul 2, 2021",maybe he possed jungkyeok hyu 
54,"Jul 2, 2021",Why is Junghyeok Yu so hot?!?? üò©
54,"Jul 1, 2021",I can sense the BL fans coming from miles away üòâ 
54,"Jul 1, 2021",üòÄ waht
54,"Jul 1, 2021",I expected the so-called king of the disciples to be a weird one not someone who is kinda cool looking LOL
54,"Jul 1, 2021","the chapter's title is First Person's POV. and technically, Dokja isn't part of the original story. he had only read the TWSA thru Junghyeok's POV -- the first person. and now, he (sorta) sees things thru Junghyeok. and what's more, do things according to his own freewill. Dokja seems like re-writing TWSA (as he have been doing all this time) ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
54,"Jul 1, 2021",Sooooo.... Dokja is going into astral projection and viewing things from Junghyuks POV? And when did he wake up? DID JIHYEE GIVE HIM THE 'LOVE LETTER'?? I  am confuzzled
54,"Jul 1, 2021",I wonder how long this is going to go on for cuz the novel has like a million chapters. Are they gonna finished it to the end? Also y‚Äôall need to prepare yourselves for some heartbreak 
54,"Jul 1, 2021",Hi guys! don't forget to Like üëâ‚ù§Ô∏è the chapters üòä
54,"Jul 1, 2021",Bruh...
54,"Jul 1, 2021","it's like the thing you do whenever you read a book you feel like you're looking through the eyes of the person and you're doing your actions, the author of this amazing comic has decided to implement that in this and basically make it actually happening, in other words yeah he is controlling Junghyeok, as of now"
54,"Jul 1, 2021",I wonder if Dokja is actually there and is pretending to be Junghyeok or if he is watching through Junghyeok‚Äôs eyes. I can‚Äôt wait to find out!
54,"Jul 1, 2021","I knew something like this was happen, I used to be like that he replaced the main character and we'll ig I was right kinda???"
54,"Jul 1, 2021","Oh my gods. Freakin‚Äô story sends me for gasping cliffhangers, Every. Single. Time. Love it hahaüíõ"
54,"Jul 1, 2021","Woahh, so he can control/view from different character view points???"
54,"Jul 1, 2021",AAAHHH-THE PLOT TWIST-
54,"Jul 1, 2021",Nooooo how did i reach the end of the free chapters already üò´
54,"Jul 1, 2021",no fucking way HE MERGED WITH JUNGHYEOK that's sick but I'm still confused 
54,"Jul 1, 2021",This is like when you read a book and feel like the main character 
54,"Jul 1, 2021","here comes the first person viewpoint, one of my personal fav, and damn did someone noticed the subtle change in jyk's look after dokja took over, such details makes it so good "
54,"Jul 1, 2021","So The Fourth Wall weakens as his Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint skill advances due to him considering the others as a part of the same world or ""immersing"" himself in the story. It's interesting, seeing two similar skills adapt/progress so differently. Or is this not necessarily the case?"
54,"Jul 1, 2021","So, are we saying that now Dokja has become the main character in TWSA (1st person in the history) ?"
54,"Jul 1, 2021",saying goodbye to all the free coins i earned from events
54,"Jul 1, 2021",fmlüò≠why do I have to wait a whole damn week
54,"Jul 1, 2021",first person pov of the protag
54,"Jul 1, 2021",Uummm... this was definitely the best episode so far.. it was dope. Thank you author!!
54,"Jul 1, 2021",sangah!!! sangah!!! sangah!!!!! you love to see it 
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Oh!! He‚Äôs ‚Äúimmersed in the story‚Äù and since Junghyeuk is main part of that story - boom, first person POV!"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",EZRTGYBGVECRXSDCFVGBYHTVCRXSDCFVGBYNTVCRDXS(I actually thought that the hooded guy was another version of Dokja...)
54,"Jun 30, 2021",damn the cliffhanger has outdone itself first time ever I experience such MASSIVE impatience Its killing me
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Waaait... with his attribute of omnicient reader being a level higher, he is now ""seeing"" the POV of another character and in this case, Junghyeok's?? Woah"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",So does that mean he turning into the main character now 
54,"Jun 30, 2021","those who dont play games, First Person view is when the player is looking through the character's eyes (I am running). Third Person is when the player is a ""floating camera"" that would follow the characters movements (He is running). Second Person doesnt rly exist, but there was a game with something resembling a second person, which is the last mission in chapter 6 of Driver : San Francisco where you are controlling a car, but seeing through the eyes of the person chasing you (you are running)"
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Tis just possession, he is watching from a first person perspective "
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Did he teleport? Like he was appearing as Junghyeok in front of the people of the other station. Or is his consciousness inside Junghyeok? 
54,"Jun 30, 2021",N-nani?!
54,"Jun 30, 2021",I‚Äòm confused af
54,"Jun 30, 2021",I think since dokja was watching in 3rd person now that it's 1st person he's probably just watching 
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Can we get ORV to the most popular Wednesday original webtoon, I feel like that's the least it deserves "
54,"Jun 30, 2021",I don't even want to think about what that creep was planning to do to poor Jihye. Glad he was the first one to die.
54,"Jun 30, 2021",thought there's an update today.. forgot I already used my coins to read the episode early..
54,"Jun 30, 2021","This honestly is one of the best webtoon there is! From plot, to character, to art. üî•ü§Ø"
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Against my better judgment, I am starting to like Pildu and hoping he survives."
54,"Jun 30, 2021","it jusf a theory what if dokja was as being a reader and he is also changing and utilising a lot of info he had read ,just like he has the experience that they are wall around them in starting  , so now he gain ability(the conflicting  skill that lead him to death and now it'sgetting more interesting üòÅ) to manipulate a lot of thing ,"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Soooooo they definitely just merged. PERFECT ! 
54,"Jun 30, 2021",seriously! this comic is getting better day by day! can't explain the excitement until u read it!!!!
54,"Jun 30, 2021",1) I HOPE THEYRE ALL OKAY AFTER THAT BLAST THO ESPECIALLY GILYEONG PLZ DONT DIE MY LITTLE MUFFIN *SOBS* 2) I TOO AM VERY CONFUSED LIKE WHAAAA
54,"Jun 30, 2021",but what about 2nd pov
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Ahh yes I always love Jihye scenes :)
54,"Jun 30, 2021",did anyone else see the item hamelins flute like from raven saga?
54,"Jun 30, 2021",That was a huge development- I'm excited to read more!!! I love how complex and creative this story is!!üòç‚ù§‚ù§
54,"Jun 30, 2021","they did look very similar, are they alternate instances of each other"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",DAAAAMN YU JUNGHYEOK HE JUST CUT OFF THAT JERK'S HEAD WITHOUT HESITATION! HE REALLY IS YU JUNGHYEOK. THE APOSTLES THO THEY BE LOOKIN' FINE. AND DOKJA BEING IN THE BODY OF JUNGYEOK HEHEHEH
54,"Jun 30, 2021",I was so pissed and now I'm so hyped and Dojka's expressions were IT and I can't handle this roller coaster of emotions lol
54,"Jun 30, 2021",ok. so that was completely unexpected. 
54,"Jun 30, 2021","NOOOO I WANTED DOKJA'S FACE BACK WHYYYYYY.

I still loved it though TvT"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",HOLY SH1T

54,"Jun 30, 2021",I can‚Äôt tell if he is watching or controlling himüíÄ
54,"Jun 30, 2021",omg new character i love it
54,"Jun 30, 2021",sad that dokja calling yjh 'the sleeping prince' doesn't included on the webtoon üòî
54,"Jun 30, 2021","I have a question, are we aloud to ship Dokja and junghyeok. I mean I doubt they will actually end upTogether but a gay can wish right? "
54,"Jun 30, 2021",wHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON
54,"Jun 30, 2021",so he became a ghost and possesed junghyeok. in reality hes doing a game moment where we play someone elses character but becauze of the story he do what that character would have done.

54,"Jun 30, 2021",OH MY......... I DONT KNOW WHETHER TO BE SCARED OR AROUSED
54,"Jun 30, 2021","so I think that lvl3 makes it where as long as your bond with a certain character is high enough, he will be able to see what is happening. at lvl4 he might be able to talk inside that characters mind if the bond is strong enough. if that's how that works our boy is shaping up to be just absolutely OP as all hell"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",wait he became him for limited time
54,"Jun 30, 2021",kek. kekekekek. dokja‚Äôs inside junghyeok. couple milestone! wooooooooo üëèüëèüëè

54,"Jun 30, 2021",Wait so is the real twist that Dokja could realize that he‚Äôs in a webcomic this whole time and that‚Äôs the real power of the fourth wall?
54,"Jun 30, 2021","So, you have chosen, Death..."
54,"Jun 30, 2021","If any of you want more of this, read the novel.  It‚Äôs simply amazing."
54,"Jun 30, 2021","well this is, interesting."
54,"Jun 30, 2021",i don't get it what is going on
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Ok so basically Dokja's first person view is like he's in Junghyeok's head, not exactly controlling him, but like...it's like he's watching a cutscene from the main character's point of view in like a video game for example"
54,"Jun 29, 2021",Lmao just bought 108 coins :)))))
54,"Jun 28, 2021",When you fast pass this episode a day before it comes out but regret it cuz now you‚Äôre on a cliffhanger XD very good episode

54,"Jun 26, 2021","ohhhhhh, his mind got inserted into Junghyeok Yu's mind"
54,"Jun 25, 2021",What the f**** is happening did he merge with Junhyeok
54,"Jun 24, 2021",is he going to get to be dokja again after this??
54,"Jun 24, 2021",i am so confused rn. help
54,"Jun 24, 2021","Soo, at some point I thought that the King of Disciples was Dokja himself but in his own regression or something like that. Doesn't seem to be true, though, now. "

54,"Dec 2, 2021",Out of all of the things I expected this was nowhere near the list‚Äî I love it when these kind of twists are thrown in!!
54,"Nov 29, 2021",It seems dokja's omniscient reader attribute greatly improved and he can now change pov's (from canon character to canon character maybe?). He can't control the characters but he can view the world through them. Like spectating when you die in fps games. (its spectating in general) (this is my understanding of the skill. It p much makes sense hikhok)
54,"Oct 30, 2021",So they've become one huh? üëÄüòè
54,"Oct 21, 2021",THIS IS SO GOOD?!
54,"Oct 15, 2021",I just realized they changed Dokja's title to king of no killing. Thank you for fixing that. 
54,"Oct 8, 2021",QUEEN SANGAH IS SO POWERFUL YEEESS
54,"Oct 7, 2021",Dokya and Junhgyeok are one... so... Marital bond or something???
54,"Oct 2, 2021",hey everyone its dokja (Mr Yu) and today im killing EVERYONE
54,"Sep 14, 2021","Its Says ""first person"" it means his POV(point of view) has upgraded to first person and he can now see what junghyeok sees."
54,"Aug 29, 2021",Is it just me or did their king look alot like Dokja
54,"Aug 20, 2021",soulmate tingz ‚ú®
54,"Aug 20, 2021",*dramatic entrance*
54,"Aug 19, 2021",I am so confused and I love it
54,"Aug 9, 2021",I just realized this.... but is the Chapter number every episode the actual chapter of the progress of the story in TWSA? 
54,"Aug 5, 2021",BRUH NOT ONLY DID THEY HAVE A KID THEY ALSO HAVE A WEIRD BOND
54,"Aug 5, 2021",WAIT WHAT JUST HAPPENED
54,"Aug 4, 2021","He has first person point of view rn so does that mean he is Junghyeok Yu atm?? I mean, yk... did he take the body and power of Junghyeok??"
54,"Aug 4, 2021",This keeps getting interesting [ the black warrior knight donates  a thumbs up] (I don‚Äôt have money)
54,"Aug 3, 2021",i am proud to admit that i am very confused. 
54,"Jul 30, 2021","Legit ""We've become one"""
54,"Jul 30, 2021","Damn, I really think Level 3 of his Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint skill can make him see what's going on in 3rd person POV and also enable him to shift to 1st person POV of any character (or maybe just Jungyeok) either as he pleases or when his presence is needed"
54,"Jul 25, 2021",Went from ‚Äúdating‚Äù him to merging with him
54,"Jul 22, 2021","Dokja: at first, I was like ‚Äúmmm pretending to be junghyeok‚Äù as a joke. But bro‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a joke anymore‚Ä¶"
54,"Jul 20, 2021",this is getting more exciting than sex
54,"Jul 19, 2021",wow just WOW
54,"Jul 9, 2021",lol he really died and went to spectator mode
54,"Jul 8, 2021",he's like spectating through yjh's body
54,"Jul 8, 2021","TO THINK THIS WASN'T ALREADY GOOD, IT JUST GOT BETTER! "
54,"Jul 8, 2021",when Dokja was immersed in jky body the dialog sounded more gay in the Korean translation. uwu
54,"Jul 7, 2021",damn i hv no words for this but the author must be so brilliant for making this
54,"Jul 7, 2021",after reading the story for like the 8th time I've began to think about it a little bit onto who made TWSA. Maybe it was secretive plotter since dokja couldn't remember that constellation inside of the novel. There is so much more other theories I have but I'll talk about them later down the line.
54,"Jul 5, 2021",so are they like connected by a bond or can dokja just move his subconscious to anyones body-
54,"Jul 5, 2021",screams in confusion 
54,"Jul 5, 2021","somebody can explain me How he gor the imortal king title? its writen that he only achieve this title If he doesnt kill anyone, but in the First scenario he has to kill Someone so he kill before. How does he get this title than?"
54,"Jul 4, 2021","They thought he was dragon hunting, turns out homeboy is actually prophet hunting. Get wrecked son"
54,"Jul 4, 2021","junghyeok: dokja be gentle, it's my first time  (‚ÅÑ ‚ÅÑ‚Ä¢‚ÅÑœâ‚ÅÑ‚Ä¢‚ÅÑ ‚ÅÑ)‚ÅÑ"

54,"Jul 3, 2021",Dokja became king of killing because the king of no killing cannot kill to be immortal. At least that's what it looks like from reading the comments. Except Dokja isn't controlling Junghyeok just experiencing it.

54,"Jul 3, 2021",That moment you catch up to yet ANOTHER series in an hour so now you have to wait for a week like everyone else ;-; (this happened to me with Lore Olympus a few days ago) =.=

54,"Jul 2, 2021","BRO HE'S TAKEN OVER AS A MAIN CHARACTER, IF HE CAN TAKE CONTROL OF HIS BODY WHEN HIS REAL BODY AS DOKJA IS OUT OF COMMISSION THIS IS WILD. Also, Jihye is gonna love her master even more now!"
54,"Jul 2, 2021",I've caught up! üéµüéµ
54,"Jul 2, 2021",i think he has the power to control someone's body cause he read the whole TWSA and also use viewpoint to track someone
54,"Jul 2, 2021",huh so Dokja's temporarily taking over Junghyeok's body? Interesting.
54,"Jul 2, 2021",(The constellation of the broke otaku is frustrated by the paywall!)
54,"Jul 2, 2021",I think Dokja was just living vicariously through Junghyeok
54,"Jul 1, 2021",anyone thort our MC is related to a god or something cos he has some mother fucking dope skills like what the hell 
54,"Jul 1, 2021","And here we have the omniscient reader's viewpoint, and the apostle... I need that smirk already in my life "

54,"Jul 1, 2021",This series is AMAZING!!!!!!
54,"Jul 1, 2021",Okay I get the hype over Dokja being able to have a  first persons view in junghyeoks body and all but the way my man Junghyeok put Jihye‚Äôs head on his lap was so ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ he‚Äôs like her big brother I love it sjsjsj 
54,"Jul 1, 2021","hey guys, stop spoiling the story. Let them find it by themselves, and enjoy the surprise like us that have already read the novel... come on... -_-"
54,"Jul 1, 2021",Incredible. Dokja's abilities are simply amazing 
54,"Jul 1, 2021",He's the reader. He used 3rd person to view a situation happening outside of his view and then he used first person to see from Junghyeok Yu's point of view. . . . you know the first person point of view from the main character.
54,"Jul 1, 2021",the kid sleeping on pildu's lap blessed my heart today
54,"Jul 1, 2021",Guys just from now on concentrate on each and every word as the story will get a little complex from now on
54,"Jul 1, 2021",beautiful kill them all
54,"Jul 1, 2021",it would be great anime if they put in a lot of effort and replicated everything as they did here.  I really really love the story üòç

I feel like this is the best plot I have ever read, but I also feel like I can‚Äôt enjoy the experience properly because I don‚Äôt fully understand it. Ig because this is a webtoon adaptation?

54,"Jun 30, 2021",it's kinda weird after you've read the  novel
54,"Jun 30, 2021",...my love for everything about this is insane...
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Well I somehow think Dokja and jungyeok are the same person. But this could also be a switching into jungyeok mind
54,"Jun 30, 2021",This is so HYPE
54,"Jun 30, 2021",gotta reread to understand the situation better... I WANT TO READ THE NOVELLLLüòî
54,"Jun 30, 2021",I don't know what is happening but I like what is happening!
54,"Jun 30, 2021","well it said ""change to first person"" which mean dokja only see through junghyeok point of view"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Anyone here ever played Final Fantasy IX?  Because this chapter really reminded me of the ATE's from it.
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Oh to be Jihye.. She lay her head on his THIGHHHH!!! LOL 
54,"Jun 30, 2021",I get that he's seeing from Junghyeok's POV. I'm more curious as to people's theories on how and why.
54,"Jun 30, 2021",confused reader: is confused... I am so lost 
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Dokja has entered spectator mode

54,"Jun 30, 2021",I‚Äôm starting to think he‚Äôs going to be the new Junghyeok in this new world üßê
54,"Jun 30, 2021",so what I think is that in the story Dokjas view is the 3rd person in the story and junghyeoks is the first and for a short amount of time while there is no 3d person in the story there can only be a 2nd and 1st person when he was floating around like a ghost he was in 2nd person or the 2nd point of view and when he switched to the 1st person point of view he took over junghyeoks body and I assume he took over his body because he that to him self that he didn't want to do something like killing
54,"Jun 30, 2021",damn he can spectate now
54,"Jun 30, 2021",GATTAIII!
54,"Jun 30, 2021",what a great way to write of the imortal king buff! Nice handling of a deus ex machina!
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Impatiently waiting for an explanation, I honestly don't see how this could have happened. All I can think of is maybe ""immortal king"" pair with the mask + lying about his identity means he gets reborn into his body? Honestly feels like the author maybe suddenly made this change due to story issues later. "

54,"Jun 30, 2021",what If the second person to completely read TWSA was the author himself ? Anyone ?
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Off topic but is it just me or does every WEBTOONs I subscribe to update today all at once?!
54,"Jun 30, 2021",wait did he just fuse with Junghyeok's body and skills which was left at the threatre ??!!
54,"Jun 30, 2021",What the
54,"Jun 30, 2021",been wondering for a little while now but could Dokja be Junghyeok Yu's first life? therefore allowing them to merge?

54,"Jun 30, 2021","[The constellation, The Sleepy Chaos, smile from his deep sleep of the situation] "
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Can he see through anyone or just characters and people he‚Äôs met?
54,"Jun 30, 2021","I have a theory that since Dokja is the only one to have read all of TWSA, he was reborn and took over Junghyeok Yu since he's the only one who would be able to take over for him and give him another chance in his regression. Doesn't really account for why he can't control his body but that's my theory "

54,"Jun 30, 2021","I think the story that they all read, the story about Junghyeok Yu is in fact the story about Dokja. Maybe."
54,"Jun 30, 2021",I really hope that dokja goes back to being his normal self
54,"Jun 30, 2021",this is gonna happen a lot
54,"Jun 30, 2021",w-what?
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Seems like the MC is the MC but Joonghyuk is a very important side character that will never go away
54,"Jun 30, 2021",I was confused for a moment coz immortal king is only possible if Dokja didn‚Äôt kill anyone. This doesn‚Äôt consider as killing does it
54,"Jun 30, 2021",this is really too good to just stay here. I NEED ANIMATION!!
54,"Jun 30, 2021",well shucky ducky quack quack! the plot thicker than cold oatmeal.

54,"Jun 30, 2021",Ok so for those of you confused I‚Äôm pretty sure that Dokja can ‚Äúobserve‚Äù what‚Äôs going on through Junghyeok hence the 1st person POV. Also notice the difference in what they are wearing when Dokja had the mask he was still wearing his body armor thing but Junghyeok appears to be wearing what he was wearing when he passes out.

54,"Jun 30, 2021",I think since he moved to FP then that means he‚Äôs now seeing through Junghyeok. He doesn‚Äôt have control but he can see through Junghyeok‚Äôs eyes.

54,"Jun 23, 2021","why why the cliffhanger and why such a major one this is even bigger clffhanger than the last one, I thought they would show Junghyeok defending the station but I didn't think it would be like that."
54,"Jun 23, 2021","aaaww i worked so hard for this fast pass and now the cliffhanger is even worse!! and ill have to wait two more weeks now, 'cause i cant fast pass anymore T_____T But nonetheless, this comic is gold."

54,"May 14, 2021","why, why have I caught up, this moment shouldn't have come so fast, why"
54,"May 14, 2021",well that was a huge plot twist ü§î im really intrigued on what will happen next I feel dokja maybe more than what he thinks and I don't think that's Yu I feel he's looking in a different universe than his so he can prepare for what is next up in the list. but non the less I can't wait to see more.

54,"May 12, 2021","I've suspected that the novel is based on the actions that Dokja takes now, essentially leading Junghyeok to the end of the story. I think my thoughts are coming true haha."
54,"May 12, 2021",hear me out since he completed the series hes now playing as the main character. And can now take over the characters that are within the regression

They could turn him into their op hero attack dog who is unmatched. They would take over the world with his strength and their knowledge. Pretty genius. They would know the best ways to buff him up and make it an oath that he can't kill himself on purpose to stop him from regressing.

54,"Jul 1, 2021",DID HE JUST-...????? Damnnnnnn I wanna see more of his abilities
54,"Jul 1, 2021",Dokja has now become the main character of the story!!! what if he was really the main character in the first place üòäüòÖ its just that he is now jungyeok's persona

His rebirt/death alteration got delayed so he probably exists as a ""soul"" now and took in charge of Junghyeok's body. Anyways, it was pretty cool!!‚ô°‚ô°"

54,"Jun 30, 2021","they're like brothers, only closer üò≥"
54,"Jun 30, 2021","These top comments do not make sense. Of course Dokja and Junghyeok share a bond. Dokja is the person that understands him the best. To me, it is a clear evolution of Dokja‚Äôs abilities. I simply find it hilarious that he is horrified that he is experiencing the situation through the eyes of Yu. Which makes sense as readers typically experience stories through the eyes of the main character(s)"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",Oh so he used the fourth wall skill or mask to appear like Junghyeok there in trouble lol

54,"May 13, 2021",just my 2 cents i believe when he entered into first person view he said somethings different meaning his body felt different so i believe dokja just entered the story where the Mc dude would be
54,"May 12, 2021",ong this episode was worth the wait. LITERALLY the main character basically fused with junghyeok! SOOO MUCH HYPE I love this webtoon 
54,"May 12, 2021",WHAAAAAT?? Seriously every single chapter ends with me screaming this at my screen

54,"Oct 14, 2021",I'm glad I stopped at chapter 36 before HAHAHAHA i stopped so i could earn the updated chapters

54,"Oct 7, 2021",Jihye really be having a MIFFY head on her sword hilt
54,"Oct 6, 2021",AYOOOO
54,"Oct 2, 2021","im pretty sure dokja used some kind of hability as a reader, like when you understand a character that much that you know what kind of choices they would take, but he straight up went to the next level, a personification of junghyeok yu wow"
54,"Sep 26, 2021",i am still confused as fuk
54,"Sep 24, 2021",I think the king is the same dokja my gosh

54,"Sep 9, 2021","Ahhhhh! Shrieking so hard. These last chapters have been amazing. Sounds like the 4th wall is restricting Dokja from full immersion at times. He's a visitor in another world. Look at those edgelords with their tattooed numbers! ü§£ Was about to say it wasn't going to be an easy fight. Sangah whipped them into shape, Gilyeong is strong, and Pildu and Jihye leveled up significantly thanks to Dokja. Plus the Ace Junghyeok is around. It's a bad day to mess with Dokja's plot"
54,"Sep 8, 2021",I really ship Dokja and Junghyeok I'm crying T_T ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

54,"Aug 16, 2021",That was awesome!!

54,"Jul 29, 2021","ok wait a minute, You should know I'm dokja team... so pls don't merge him with anyone!‡≤† ‡≥ß ‡≤†"
54,"Jul 29, 2021",who knew the aouther can have this much info in mind
54,"Jul 28, 2021","Folks, calm down. For those who don't understand - Dokja is using his skill Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint Stage 3 atm, which grants him the power to submerge with a person when Dokja is dead - which will happen a lot, by the way. Lol, I still remember being amazed by Dokja's personal skills. This guy never fails to surprise me. And, yes, he's controlling Joonghyuk."
54,"Jul 26, 2021",So right now he's inside Junghyeok Yu
54,"Jul 23, 2021",whoa

54,"Jul 15, 2021",Uhm...hold up. Was the dude speaking while he was headless AND holding her ponytail? Freaky panel.
54,"Jul 14, 2021","Is this king somehow related to dokja? As in, a future or alternate version of him?"
54,"Jul 14, 2021",Hell yea hell yea
54,"Jul 14, 2021",Dokja‚Äôs mad mad
54,"Jul 13, 2021",I screamed so loud üò≠ on the last panel
54,"Jul 13, 2021",Best episode so farrrrrrrrrrrrr.
54,"Jul 12, 2021",WHAT
54,"Jul 12, 2021","Dokja is using foresight, but a game glitch made it so he can see through the eyes of Junghyeok"
54,"Jul 9, 2021","Theory: One Dokja is going to live in Junghyeok Yu's body ""through first person"", while the other one is getting revived from Immortal King. Two Dokja's simultaneously, pullin a Gantz"
54,"Jul 9, 2021","i see in other language, rules to be first person view is the character think of Dokja too. So basically, junghyeok thinking about Dokja right now. Well, i read other comment, i dunno it is a spoiler or a scam"
54,"Jul 9, 2021",I am screaming inside
54,"Jul 9, 2021",omg I'm going totally crazy
54,"Jul 9, 2021",primera vez utilizando punto de vista de tercera persona.  todo loquillo el yoo jonghyuk cuando mata a los profetas  y a han sooyoung
54,"Jul 8, 2021",can he go back to his old self i like him better when he wasn't wearing junghyeok(no bad hate)
54,"Jul 7, 2021",HAN SOOYOUNGGG!!!
54,"Jul 7, 2021",I like the No Killing King term better than Immortal King. It suits best to that attribute
54,"Jul 7, 2021",So basically he is the only person who knows the whole story he has the ability to travel through the story
54,"Jul 7, 2021","Damn, I‚Äôm confused"
54,"Jul 7, 2021",WHaTs GoInG oN???  ï ò‚Äø ò î
54,"Jul 6, 2021",is that like the ability copying bookmark thing but instead of the ability it's their whole personality and abilities
54,"Jul 6, 2021",Fck y am i so broke??? 
54,"Jul 4, 2021",somebody pls explain? 
54,"Jul 3, 2021",Anyone else simping for the enemy or just me? ü§°ü§°
54,"Jul 2, 2021","Could someone without spoiling explain what the conditions for maintaining the ""Immortal King/King of No Killing"" attribute is? I understood that you can obtain it if you never killed anyone but what count as killing in ORV? Dokja caused (indirectly?) the death of people several times :/ Didn't he amputate people with his sword some chapters ago? Surely they bled to death? If you reply, please don't spoil: the answer is a spoiler just say that it's one and I'll wait. "
54,"Jul 2, 2021","It says that the ""immortal king"" attribute can only be obtained when he has not killed anyone, but in ch. 16 he killed a guy, didn't he?
I'm kinda confused here."
54,"Jul 2, 2021",POV: Juhnyeok was there watching the whole thing
54,"Jul 2, 2021",Another great chapter! Sponsored it with 1 like üëâ‚ù§Ô∏è.  If only I can give it 1B more!üòò
54,"Jul 2, 2021",Yes!!!
54,"Jul 2, 2021",what just happened-
54,"Jul 2, 2021",How the hell that happened? Dokja as Junghyeok for real this time? AhhhhI'm suspecting somehow that the king of those is like a clone of Dokja or maybe the author 7u7
54,"Jul 2, 2021","he did choose immortal king, so he should not die... dose he like chance bodies with someone dead when the body he is in dies? or can he use his ability to go inside other peoples minds to control them/watch what they are doing?"
54,"Jul 2, 2021",WHAT‚Äì
54,"Jul 2, 2021",So Dokja teleported? And is still wearing that mask? ohk
54,"Jul 1, 2021",I am so confused right now‚Ä¶
54,"Jul 1, 2021",Okay so dokja is number 1 and dokja's soul is in junhyeok's body? 
54,"Jul 1, 2021",did he take over junghyeok?!
54,"Jul 1, 2021",oh damn mama plot twist
54,"Jul 1, 2021","So Dokja is now Junghyeok? previously Junghyeok was just a puppet, a souless body, and now Dokja can separate his soul from his body, so Dokja's soul is now into Junghyeok body (???) Just a theory..."
54,"Jul 1, 2021","Oh, just look at who turned out to be a throwaway supporting character!"
54,"Jul 1, 2021","wah wah what did just happen here!spectating, merging or maybe telepathy?"

54,"Jul 30, 2021",Does the Level 3 of Dokja's Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint skill enable him to be in the First Person POV of any character in TWSA? Or is it just Junghyeok Yu?

54,"Jul 28, 2021",Huh?
54,"Jul 28, 2021","hold up, what if junghyeok had so many lives because readers merged with him? He's like a vessel for the reader to fill and continue the story. Which is why he does different acts"
54,"Jul 28, 2021","sooooo is Dokja, in a way, possessing Joonghyuk? like a possession????? "

54,"Jul 14, 2021",Guys. wasnt Dojka just disguised as Junghyeok? Obviously he'd still use Junghyeok's name to his advantage 
54,"Jul 12, 2021",Is Dojka Kim spectating Junghyeok? 
54,"Jul 12, 2021","When the main bad guy walked up. I was like. Whoa, is this guya clone of dokja But then I realized only their hair/body shape was similar "
54,"Jul 11, 2021",Holy moly yall!
54,"Jul 8, 2021",I'M SO CONFUSED! CAN DOKJA CONTROL JUNGHYEOK OR DO THEY HAVE A SPECIAL BOND??
54,"Jul 8, 2021",hsy üëÄ
54,"Jul 8, 2021",Is dokja in junghyeok body but he has no control over him?
54,"Jul 7, 2021",Lmaoo. I‚Äôm on edge!!
54,"Jul 6, 2021",I‚Äôm so confused...
54,"Jul 6, 2021",√±
54,"Jul 3, 2021",am i the only one feeling the DBZ vibes rn? yes just me damn....
54,"Jul 2, 2021",Wait what if Junghyeok and Dokja stay together in one body throughout the whole story? 
54,"Jul 2, 2021",wait dokja did kill people tho? can someone explain the immortal king aspect please
54,"Jul 1, 2021","Well.. I thought Dokja had already killed tons of people. Like at the first station, where there was that manipulative guy, where Hyieon (spelled it wrong, I am sure) and him fought everyone, and he made one of those ""we gotta kill to survive"" kind of speeches. I am confused."
54,"Jun 30, 2021",I don‚Äôt follow how he‚Äôs able to get immortal king.  Didn‚Äôt he kill someone on the way to the first subway station after he killed the Ithyosaur?  Wasn‚Äôt that entire sub mission to kill the group leader?
54,"Jun 30, 2021","OK SO HERE'S WHAT I THINK! ---Chungmoro or whatever the station's called is the main base. Dokja died. He was in 3rd pov watching what was happening in the main base. Now he's there (respawned i think), still with the mask thing on, and taking action!!! BIG THING HERE IS that immersion thing. The #1 disciple guy definitely read practically all the story. question is did he read all of it; miss the last author's note; and is he the same as the ""Prophets"" or is he a second omniscient reader?"
54,"Jun 30, 2021",YES GET THEM
54,"Jun 30, 2021",NANI?!

54,"Jun 30, 2021",Wait- merging with each other? Ngl that‚Äôs kinda g√¶-
54,"Jun 30, 2021","Junghyeok yu and Dokja are two very different people. they are not merging. i repeat. not merging. im not sure how youre all confused. it literally said 1st person POV. theyre practically telling you what happened with dokjas skill. pretty  sure knowing 1st, 2nd, 3rd person singular, 3rd person plural and 3rd person omniscient are covered in basic grade school english."
54,"Aug 2, 2021",why does it smell so fruity üòï‚ùï‚ùï
54,"Jul 1, 2021","dokja lost his own body, so he got a body of a character he had the best understanding of. honestly this is second best webtoon. after the tower of god. somebody,  give the author a cookie. "

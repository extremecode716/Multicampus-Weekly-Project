Episode,Date,Review
86,"Jan 5, 2022",I really really hope this is just a trick up Dokja's sleeve and that he wont actually abandon Bihyeong
86,"Jan 5, 2022","I know Bihyeong (the white Dokkaebi) did terrible things too, but it’s heartbreaking to see him cry like a child 😥. Will Dokja really abandon him? Or will Dokja fulfil his promise (in ep 14) to make him the Dokkaebi King? 👑"
86,"Jan 5, 2022",Junghyeok really invented hibernating b*tch face
86,"Jan 5, 2022","""why can't he pass out normally?"" honestly I live for the little side comments like this one they always make me laugh lmfaoo 😂😂😂"
86,"Jan 5, 2022",Bihyeong looks kinda cuddly when he's that size ngl
86,"Jan 5, 2022",Waiting for Dokja to pull an uno reverse card for the plausibility play in this new channel
86,"Jan 5, 2022",can't he literally just say he doesn't want to kill? like he's not holding back he just doesn't want to kill people and lose his ability
86,"Jan 5, 2022",how dare you make me empathize with a dokkaebi 😂
86,"Jan 5, 2022",This is definitely a trick. He switched his attitude way to suddenly for it to be anything but that. Any other dokkaebi wouldn't manipulate things and help him the way Bihyeong has been
86,"Jan 5, 2022",Yooo wtf the only one who can bully our buddy biheyong is Dokja and Dokja alone 
86,"Jan 5, 2022","it really speaks to this story to have you feeling something and have some stake for Bihyeong over other dokkaebi lol. I could tell even in the way he was drawn. as the story went on and how Dokja outsmarted/matched up to him, that's how we got here. damn. love this comic. coins well spent"
86,"Jan 5, 2022","“ WHO INVITED WHO NOW??🤨” - Dokja Kim, 2022 😂😂😂"
86,"Jan 5, 2022","Nooo, poor Bihyeong!!! Can't wait for Dokja to scam Dokgak like he always do to everyone "
86,"Jan 12, 2022",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' was dissatisfied with the intervention of the immediate dokkaebis.][The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' was complaining with the slow processing of loans.][5 coins have been sponsored.]//Happy birthday 🎂 KDJ!!
86,"Jan 5, 2022",I mean Financially sabotaging your enemies is a tried and true method of success 
86,"Jan 5, 2022","Poor bihyeong.. dude can never catch a break, and dokja’s eyes look kinda heavy as of late "
86,"Jan 5, 2022",Just trust Kim Dokja
86,"Jan 5, 2022","[Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" roars in anger at Dokgak for sabotaging Bihyeong's channel, reducing his size, and making him cry]"
86,"Jan 5, 2022",I feel bad for biheyong….. but then I remember what he did in the first chapter🥺👀
86,"Jan 5, 2022","DOKJA PLEASE HAVE A PLAN I CANT STAND TO SEE BIHYEONG SO UPSET. Even if he's supposed to be evil, I STILL CANT STAND IT"
86,"Jan 5, 2022",Tiny Bihyeong 🥺
86,"Jan 5, 2022",DOKJA DONT ABANDON BIHYEONG HES PRECIOUS 
86,"Jan 5, 2022","I get the feeling dokja is gonna beat the crap outta the red one and put bihyeong in charge, that'd be neat"
86,"Jan 5, 2022","BIHYUNG, YOU BEAUTIFUL GOBLIN, IT HURTS ME TO SEE YOU CRY."
86,"Jan 5, 2022",So much has happened during the survival scenario's day 3...
86,"Feb 3, 2022",NO ONE WILL HURT MY BIHYEONG😭😭😭 LOOK AT THAT SMALL BABY. I'LL BE THROWING HANDS WITH EVERY ONE WHO MAKES HIM CRY
86,"Jan 5, 2022",I wanna be in the room where it happens
86,"Feb 9, 2022",HOW TF IS HE HIBERNATING WHILE LOOKING LIKE THAT LMAO
86,"Jan 5, 2022",what an asshole 
86,"Feb 9, 2022","[The constellation Bald General of Justice’s mouth is gaping open.] //
[The constellation ‘Prisoner of the Golden Headband’ is chuckling.] //

[The constellation ‘Secretive Plotter’ shrugs like it is fine.] // ahhh this was cut out after Dokgak's claim about Dokja manipulating the scenarios. It's fine though. Just some extra interesting information for webtoon-onlies..."
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Has no one ever mentioned that the Dokkaebi are so cute 
86,"Jan 5, 2022",Welcome back everyone!!! Happy New Year!!!! 🎉🎊🎆What a ways to start off 2022 
86,"Feb 9, 2022","...dokkaebi boyfriend is crying. save him, dokja, youre his only hope"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",man this is the longest day in webtoon history. 
86,"Feb 9, 2022",*sees the coat* AHHHHHHHH ITS ON ITS WAY
86,"Feb 9, 2022","While Bihyeong was an ass throughout, he seemed to be probably the more nice and genuine Dokkaebi (Not that that says much lol).  Dokja already has an arrangement with him if I remember correctly, and likely trusts him way more than Dokgak. I can see Dokja trying to restore Bihyeong's channel, while destroying Dokgak's."
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Dokja kinda looks pissed. Probably gonna put a cap in him.
86,"Feb 9, 2022","Dokja isn't stupid, but he isn't cold hearted either. Him knowing what's going on, it is clear that he's playing an act right now before releasing a bombshell to help Bihyeong😅if he does abandon him (which is hardly likely) it'd be for a good reason."
86,"Feb 9, 2022","Dokja *sheds a tear*: You see Antinus is actually Jonghyuk's long-lost aunt. And Ilsang... *tears up further* Ilsang had been one of Jonghyuk's most avid fans....They finally got to see Jonghyuk after all this time, and I. I didn't want to take that away. That's why I stalled and didn't kill them. I know that I'm meant to be able to make cold, hard decisions in this apocalypse after all this time, but....my humanity just wouldn't allow me to. *dramatically drops to the floor crying*"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",creator I just want to say that this story is amazing and it is my honor to use this story as a base for a huge school assignment. I'm making a movie trailer about this webtoon and i feel like it will do amazing. thank you for such a wonderful story that keeps me in my toes at all times.
86,"Jan 5, 2022",I have a feeling that Dokja is just cooking up a plan and I hope I'm right and he's still gonna help Bihyeong
86,"Feb 9, 2022","""perhaps i don't know this world as well as i thought i do"" the way the unwritten scenes, the ones deemed unimportant by tls123, are the ones that make this world seem more real is so!!! to see the aftermath of the scenarios from a more focused lens rather than one that let's us view it as just a part of a whole, larger story makes more of an impact to kdj, who's only ever needed to observe from the outside. the thought that went into every aspect of ORV makes me appreciate it so much more! "
86,"Feb 9, 2022","I'm not worried, I don't think Dokja will leave Bihyeong"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",No Bihyeong honey don't cry aahh IK HE'S KILLED MULTIPLE PPL but he's still adorbs
86,"Feb 9, 2022",I legit thought that Junghyeok wanted to kill Dokja. Man's got a resting bitch face
86,"Feb 9, 2022",BIHYEONG LOOKS SO CUTE THIS CHAPTER 😭😭
86,"Feb 9, 2022",👏LET👏DOKJA👏REST👏A LITTLE👏
86,"Feb 9, 2022","damn, Dokgak is such a bitch, I wonder if Dokja has a plan to get Bihyeong's channel back to the way it was I'd hate it if we never get to see him again just look at him and how cute he is also Junghyeok glaring at Dokja well being unconscious is just too funny"
86,"Jan 5, 2022","Welp, time to go beat up Dokgak.🤷‍♂️"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",WHY IS BIHYEONG SO ADORABLE
86,"Feb 9, 2022","Common misconception. Dokja's 'King of No Killing' attribute means that he can't kill humans. So it applies to him not killing Seolhwa, I guess, but not the rest of the situations. Dokgak was mostly accusing him of hiding his strength till the last moment on purpose and manipulating the scenario I think."
86,"Feb 9, 2022",When did I start adoring bihyeong? I'm shookt
86,"Feb 10, 2022",We are this close 👌 to Dokja's iconic coat. Can't wait
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Yjh's jawline😩😩💳😩💥💳💥
86,"Feb 9, 2022",You are special. You are loved.
86,"Feb 9, 2022",This is the longest 24hrs ever and I’m all for it!!!
86,"Feb 9, 2022","No! You're lying! He's not like that, he has a plan I'm sure"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",AYYYYYY F YOU FLOATING RED DUMBO
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Bihyeong is literally the cutest though.
86,"Jan 5, 2022",Bro always has a plan he won't let Bihyeong down. When Dokja sympathizes he always has something going. He'll beat this guy but gotta build up the antagonist first or it won't be sugar. Hang tight.
86,"Feb 15, 2022",Happy bday to our dearest reader
86,"Feb 10, 2022",webtoon only readers: I know I shouldn't like Bihyeong cuz dokkaebi are evil but...webnovel readers: oh you fools
86,"Feb 9, 2022",this is just dokja cooking up something....
86,"Feb 9, 2022",does this means Dokja is going to be surviving in another country for a time? 
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Junghyeok is literally always passing out
86,"Mar 9, 2022",I'm loving Bihyeong even more in this chapter and I don't know why... Maybe it's he's cuteness but yeah I am loving him
86,"Feb 21, 2022",I never thought I'd say this but Bihyeong is adorableee
86,"Feb 10, 2022",DOKJA COAT DOKJA COAT DOKJA COAT 
86,"Feb 10, 2022",I WILL FIGHT FOR BIHYEONG DONT CRY YOU FLOOFY BALL OF DESTRUCTION 
86,"Feb 9, 2022",But the dude cannot kill because of a skill……..
86,"Feb 9, 2022","Secretive Plotter will be proud of this turn of events, won’t he?"
86,"Feb 9, 2022","""Why can't he pass out normally?"" lmao but yeah"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",from when did I begin to sympathize this white fluffy thing?
86,"Feb 9, 2022","Bihyeong went from ""Evil Character"" to WHY IS HE SO ADORABLE LOOKING?!?!"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",okay but... why can't his face calm down even when he's unconscious 
86,"Feb 9, 2022",I know Dokja isn't going to abandon Bihyeong because they are partners. At least I hope not.
86,"Feb 9, 2022",PETITION TO SAVE BIHYEONG!!!
86,"Feb 9, 2022","fickle are the ways of the star stream. the constellations didn't even give Biheyong a chance to explain, they just left as soon as the accusation was made, even though there could be many other perfectly valid reasons for Dokja not killing any of those guys. some can even be revealed without any serious consequences!"
86,"Feb 9, 2022","All this scenarios happened already yet there are still 7 days left??? damn, just how long has their day been-"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",dokja still has a contract lets not forget that.
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Ngl small Bihyeong looks quite cute 
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Dang… I hope Dokja had a plan. Also Junghyeok passing out that like is hilarious. 
86,"Jan 5, 2022",Junghyeok better make self made cooked food for dokja as payback after this🗿lol
86,"Jan 5, 2022",I just know that this man Dokja better trick him and help our boy Bihyeong out 
86,"Jan 5, 2022",Baby Bihyeong is adorable and i know that he did some horrible things but i hope Dokja doesn’t actually leave him. 
86,"Mar 11, 2022",I sure hope it's a ruse. I've unintentionally grown attached to Bihyeong after all this time. He's a little shit but he's OUR little shit.
86,"Mar 10, 2022",i hope dokja ain't such a douchebag to actually leave bihyeong like that
86,"Feb 18, 2022",Bihyeong wasn’t that good at first..though I mean who is in an apocalypse like this? I’ve grown to really like him! Please don’t abandon him!! Seeing him cry like that and being a doormat is so sad..😥
86,"Feb 12, 2022",HOW DARE THIS UGLY ASS TOMATO DO THAT TO OUR BIHYEONG😡
86,"Feb 11, 2022",PLEASE WHY IS TINY BIHYEONG SO CUTE
86,"Feb 10, 2022",Infinite Dimension Space Coat <333
86,"Feb 9, 2022","NOOO DOKGAK IS SO PETTY :(( poor Bihyeong, his channel was so successful too! HELP HIM GET IT BACK DOKJA 😤😤"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",#justiceforbihyeong 😤 
86,"Feb 9, 2022",I believe in Dokja! there's no way he'd abandon Bihyeong like that and break a promise :)
86,"Feb 9, 2022","Dokgak said the infamous line, ""Interesting.."" ..does this mean he's the male lead ??"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",I WANT TO BE HERE FOR THE 1000 COMMENT CELEBRATION *SOBS*
86,"Feb 9, 2022",kazooom Is it possible for you to hold the fort in the hours I'm gone?
86,"Feb 9, 2022",ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE LEGENDARY COAT FIT THOUGH SO HYPED
86,"Feb 9, 2022",NOVEL SPOILERS: I'm actually gonna cry if they translate 'Paul' differently. That was such a pivotal point that I could use for bullying the dude.
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Bihyeong is a cute small cotton ball
86,"Feb 9, 2022",bihyeong is so cute lol :<<
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Ya'll ready for a scam? Hehehehe
86,"Feb 9, 2022",NOOO I LOVE BIHYEONG
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Bihyeong became adorable in this episode.
86,"Feb 9, 2022",NOOO BIHYEONG :'((((( if he were a plush i would buy him HAHA
86,"Feb 9, 2022",That new Dokkaebi is acting like a salty ex
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Bihyeong is better than that red bxtch tbh🙄
86,"Feb 9, 2022",*cough**cough* king of no killing *cough**cough*
86,"Feb 9, 2022","I hope Dokja is just joining the other channel to mess everything up to help poor Bihyeong, because that was just sad. 😭 He looked so defenseless, that broke my heart. 💀💔"
86,"Feb 9, 2022","Today's info: The World After Apocalypse, which is singshong's another novel, is comicalized in naver. Also, after republishing of TWAA novel, ORV spinoff is announced"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Don't bully  Bihyeong!
86,"Feb 9, 2022",This feels like a pyramid scheme of manhwas. now i have to read this whole thing till the end in case it starts happening in real life. 
86,"Feb 9, 2022",this is so sad😭😭 ive loved bihyeong from episode 1 even tho he kinda murdered hundreds of ppl like he's so adorable and I want to be his friend
86,"Feb 9, 2022",F*ck dokgak 
86,"Feb 9, 2022","Spoiler Free situation (I hope) but... The interactions between Dokja and this Red one wiill cause us to laugh, then feel sorrow, then anger, and finally Satisfaction."
86,"Jan 5, 2022",I feel bad but I have to remember the consolations and the dollar are bads in this story. they enjoy watching people fight fornthere lives lose everything and be left with nothing. 
86,"Jul 16, 2022",As much as I hate it I love Bihyeong
86,"Jul 11, 2022",NO PLEASE DONT LEAVE BIHYEONG! I like him! Cutest of the Dokkaebi! 
86,"Jun 25, 2022",I need a bihyeong plushy like right now
86,"Jun 6, 2022","Even unconscious, Jeonghyuk glares at Dokja..."
86,"Mar 29, 2022","nah i know he wont leave bihyeong like that, bihyeong is basically dokja's pokemon"
86,"Mar 27, 2022",bihyeong's face made me cry 😭
86,"Feb 10, 2022",I have faith that our boy won't abandon I fluffy furball in his time of need. 
86,"Feb 10, 2022",NOOOOOOO Dokja don't abandon your kid :(( 
86,"Feb 10, 2022",Okay but Bihyeong shrinking in size and crying was very cute though
86,"Feb 10, 2022","HE'S NOT GONNA ABANDON OUR DEVIL BABY! HE CANT....DOKJA DONT LET ME DOWN! 😭😭😭 (His intentions were more malicious in the beginning, but at that point you had more to gain than him and he was still helping you.)"
86,"Feb 10, 2022","I FEEL SO BAD FOR BIHYEONG-but knowing Dokja, he probably has a plan to fix this :D"
86,"Feb 10, 2022",This is cool and all BUT WHERE IS GILYEONG. WHERE IS THE BOY. IS HE OKAY???
86,"Feb 10, 2022",Wow didn’t see that coming! Dokja and Bihyeong being exposed like that was unexpected! Omniscient reader always with the awesome chapters 👍🔥🔥
86,"Feb 10, 2022","I'm assuming he's gonna join Dokgak's channel, decimate the scenarios and basically say ""you think your channel is any better than Buhyeong's?"" "
86,"Feb 10, 2022",This is a perfectly good example of how I am more creative when I am sleep-deprived.
86,"Feb 10, 2022",yay the white coat
86,"Feb 9, 2022",aw bihyeong🥺
86,"Feb 9, 2022",would be pretty fun y if he joined his channel just to start promoting bihyeongs channel
86,"Feb 9, 2022","Not Bihyeong getting bullied. I don't think Dokja is truly abandoning him tho, I'm sure he has something up his sleeve"
86,"Feb 9, 2022","dokja would NEVER abandon bihyeong, he'll come back 🛐"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Bihyeong 🥺🥺 Don’t worry Dokja is pissed of at the red tomato he wouldn’t make any deals with him for long term 
86,"Feb 9, 2022","I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO FINISH, GOODBYE CHEESY AS PIE. I'M KILLING MYSELF FOR ATLEAST 8HRS"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",HAPPY NEW YEAARRR
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Nooo I like bihyeong he better come back and rebuild the channel. I bet he’s planning on destroying red guy. Yeah that’s it.
86,"Feb 9, 2022","""Who invited who now?"" 😶"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Dokja gonna end this dokkaebi's whole career later. 
86,"Feb 9, 2022",yeah it was around this part in the novel where I started to feel bad for Bihyoung 
86,"Feb 9, 2022",I really hope Dokja has a plan and doesn't abandon Bihyeong just like that.
86,"Feb 9, 2022",cant wait for master scammer dokja to scam the heck outta the new dokkaebi
86,"Feb 9, 2022",what a sore loser
86,"Feb 9, 2022","Bihyeong is a little bastard, that's true... BUT HE'S OUR LITTLE BASTARD!!! WE DON'T WANT THIS RED BITCH! JUSTICE FOR BIHYEONG!!!"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Nooo... Bihyeong crying is so heartwrenching! I hope Dokja has something planned here...
86,"Feb 9, 2022",No because everyone's feeling so bad for Bihyeong (me included) when he was the one who set them all up to kill each other in the beginning 😭 I can't believe how well this story is written that I actually find myself feeling sorry for the very same Dokkaebi that caused so many people to die as well as hope Dokja ends up helping him :')))
86,"Feb 9, 2022",i feel bad for bihyeong hes such a pushover
86,"Feb 9, 2022",my man won't do that to bihyeong... i just know it.
86,"Feb 9, 2022",my heart is broken and Bihyeong is just so cute in his tiny baby form 😭
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Hurt “friend”…Pissed off Dokja…A-Hole going down!!!
86,"Feb 9, 2022","Dokgak knows how to do business. If he is going to spend his own money, it better be on an investment, someone on his own channel. That said, I hope Dokja bails Bihyeong out of this, even though Bihyeong is greedy, he at least seems friendly with Dokja enough to help him out, weakening catastrophes and suggesting better rewards. Dokgak would throw Dokja under the bus."
86,"Feb 9, 2022","DOKJA JUST BETRAYED HOMEBOY LIKE THAT, IS HE EFFING SERIOUS????"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Bihyeong's crying face broke my heart 
86,"Feb 9, 2022","In the beginning Bihyeong seemed kinda like an ass, but seeing him tear up and look sad really makes you feel bad for the little fella. "
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Damnnn why you so salty?? God find someone else to rake in views for you. Sheesh
86,"Feb 9, 2022",BIHYEONG BEST DOKKAEBI
86,"Feb 9, 2022",I’m starting to feel a little sympathy for that little white demon Dokja isn’t the only one trying to survive all of this
86,"Feb 9, 2022",I feel bad for Bihyeong ಥ‿ಥ
86,"Feb 9, 2022",what a dick.
86,"Feb 9, 2022","bihyeong my beloved... it hurts seeing him like this 😭 I love the way he's drawn, so cute ! "
86,"Feb 9, 2022",I don’t like the red one 
86,"Feb 4, 2022",Damn that red dokkaebi is such a petty scumbag. He literally screwed over bihyeong’s channel to force dokja to jump ship and join his channel. But i got a good feeling despite biheyong being scummy at times is a valuble ally. There’s no way dokja would abandon him now. So he’s definitely gonna come up with something to turn this around if he can.
86,"Jan 5, 2022",My poor baby bihyeong 🥺 please wait for a little while! Trust in Dokja 🙏
86,"Jan 5, 2022","Damn the manipulation was on another level here. Wonder if we'll get to meet ""management"" soon though 🤔🤔🤔Also we still on 7 days remaining! "
86,"Jan 5, 2022","Bro they did him dirty, however I hope Dokja doesn’t really join him."

86,"Mar 29, 2022",bihyeong is so cute 😭 I wanna squeeze him so bad
86,"Mar 29, 2022",im sure dokja will resuscitate bihyeng's channel he's probably planning something

86,"Feb 18, 2022",I feel bad for Bihyeong😭
86,"Feb 17, 2022",A fact nobody asked: 'Dokgak' means 'one-leg' in Korean
86,"Feb 17, 2022",Why does Bihyeong gets cuter the more  he(?) suffer?

86,"Feb 10, 2022",Did anybody see dokya really eating 3 times per day and sleeping 6h? I think he kind of failed the scenario.

86,"Feb 9, 2022",that was to much
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Remember back when we were all terrified of Bihyeong 
86,"Feb 9, 2022",mod abuse
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Bihyeong laughs at all the misery he puts humans thru. don't let that cute face make you forget that
86,"Feb 9, 2022",It’s been 7 days remaining for 3749593739 years now
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Honestly Bihyeong deserves it. My guy kills people for fun and profit. Stay losing. 
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Why do I feel like that Dokja just agreed to be able to get his hands on the reward and using those rewards to kick goblins little butt 
86,"Feb 9, 2022","[constellation wanderer of the no man's land ] Laughing to himself. I don't think the little red guy had stopped and considered what he's doing. He thinks it is just  scalping a source  for his channel.  For starters, it could be argued that he is interfering with the scenario like the last Dokkaebi . 2nd,  with the no killing king tile, all his examples can be explained that he does want to lose the power of coming back from the dead in the Apocalypse. "
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Ok now that you’ve received your reward tell him you changed your mind about the channel change 
86,"Feb 9, 2022",wait...didn't Dokja had an ability that doesn't allow him to kill?
86,"Feb 9, 2022",GUYS WHITE COAT DOKJA IS ALMOST HERE HE'S ALMOST
86,"Feb 9, 2022",I'm waiting for the moment when the dokabi realize that he knows the entire story because of the author aka the creator of the universe and therefore has his blessing - that's gonna be fun
86,"Feb 9, 2022",This is the first time I'm feeling bad for Bihyeong :'))
86,"Feb 9, 2022",somehow i know his channel will be the one not passing plausibility
86,"Feb 9, 2022",dokgak👎👎👎
86,"Feb 9, 2022",It's official that the only Dokkaebi I like here is only Bihyeong😤

86,"Feb 9, 2022",I love this webtoon so much 
86,"Feb 9, 2022",there’s no way dokja would betray bihyeong like that. although he might actually do it lmao idk 
86,"Jan 5, 2022",Lmaoooo I love how Dokja just referenced a soccer term 😂😂 la Liga is my fave bro how’d you know ⚽️❤️

86,"Sep 23, 2022","bihyeong is not the best guy out there but i lowkey pity him, he really did worked hard foe his channel (though many ppl die bcs of that) but this is a bully against bihyeong. that red ddeokgelbi has more power and bullied bihyeong"
86,"Aug 8, 2022",of dokja ever betrays my bestie bilhyong i swear imma jump into the comic and give him an earful i swear

86,"Feb 26, 2022",i know Dokja will not abandon Bihyeong
86,"Feb 18, 2022",I guess he always thought Junghyeok became a jaded jerk for selfish/unworthy reasons. Which is why Dokja wanted to be a hero DESPITE Junghyeok. But now he's realizing Junghyeok is honestly like a lot of nurses and mental health workers- he became jaded because of the trauma of his work.

86,"Feb 12, 2022",Can anybody explain the whole rule of plausibility thing to me? Because I haven’t got a clue what’s going on with that :(
86,"Feb 12, 2022",I really can't believe that I just already arrive at the last chapter that is available for me to read for free...I'm ㅠ▪ㅠ
86,"Feb 12, 2022","Tsk, tsk, tsk. Oh ye of little faith! You really think Dojka would let himself be lead like that? He has more pride than that, y'know?"
86,"Feb 11, 2022",Oooh he did him dirty

86,"Feb 11, 2022",I binge read the last 85 chapters and it just hit me how bad the cliff hangers are cause I have to wait for the next chapter 😐
86,"Feb 10, 2022","is ""The World After the Fall"" manhwa in this universe?(or in the same world) as this manhwa, as i read the chapter 6 of it i saw dokja reading on his phone. is it related? or just a easter egg or just a reference."

86,"Feb 10, 2022",bye it’s gonna be fun knowing what happens next😌 yall just wait for Bihyeong !!!
86,"Feb 10, 2022",A random shit but do u all know that the other novel by this author got webtoon adapt too? And kdj appeared there as well(it's at ch6) oh but well it doesn't have any offc eng trans tho😋😋
86,"Feb 10, 2022",I trust that Dokja has something up his sleeve 😂😭 I hope he makes Dokgak's life very difficult
86,"Feb 10, 2022","This argument feels dumb. They were literally told from the start they were playing a game in order to entertain the constellations and earn coins. Doing that outright encourages what he’s accusing Dokja of doing, it’s *basic* logic. Utterly *basic*. The constellations should be happy someone is clever enough to put on a good show for them. Ignoring the fact that, ironically, while they seemed to have done something questionable, they didn’t actually *intentionally* do what they’re accused of."

86,"Feb 10, 2022",bihyung ily ure so cute ilysm sigh makes me think abt u in the novel...
86,"Feb 10, 2022",remember the terms the red dokkaebi said he'd agree to if Dokja joined him? I have a feeling Dokja will use those to help Bihyeong
86,"Feb 10, 2022",I believe that he won't betray white dokkaebi
86,"Feb 10, 2022",of course it is a trick he won't abandon a friend or whatever they are in need 
86,"Feb 10, 2022",i really felt sad for bihyeong he worked hard for the channel and it  gets degraded for the other dokkaebi wanting dokja to join him

86,"Feb 9, 2022","I'm kind of surprised that he didn't try to screw this guy by calling out his private communications in front of all the constellations. Got a feeling that Red's still going to end up ruined at the end of all this, though."
86,"Feb 9, 2022",No I love Bihyeong. Also I’m sure Dokja won’t abandon Bihyeong. He has something up his sleeve.

Kim Dokja: What do you mean? //
Han Sooyoung: Don't you ever get that tiny voice in your head that tells you if something is going get you into trouble? //
Kim Dokja: uh No, not really //
Han Sooyoung: That explains so much actually. //
Han Sooyoung: … //
Han Sooyoung: Whatever, f*ck it. Let's just go. //
Kim Dokja: Didn't you say this was a bad idea? //
Han Sooyoung: Yes, I did! I fucking told you!"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",I REALLY hope Dokja makes the reward like fixing Bihyeong’s channel. I know he’s a dokkaebi and all but it seems like he was actually liking Dokja and it would be extremely painful if Dokja just dumped him like that😭
86,"Feb 9, 2022",He could have just said he let them live to keep his immortality 
86,"Feb 9, 2022",😭😢😢 I hope he's gonna turn this around on dokgak...
86,"Feb 9, 2022",but he couldn't kill them cause he's the king of no killing?
86,"Feb 9, 2022",He accepted his offer that no one else heard and that was not signed.
86,"Feb 9, 2022",So weird… the shift between the two worlds (players and spectators) is a hard shift for me 
86,"Feb 9, 2022","... How many chapters has it been now that the time remaining is 7 days? 20 chapters? I could look back and find out, but I know it's been a *while*. 😅"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Dokgak shall return and cause trouble again
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Just watch he’s going to give all his coins to him 😏 edit: this is just a guess
86,"Feb 9, 2022",dude I thought my image of Bihyeong in my head when I was reading the novel was adorable. this is downright too much! he's practically a pokemon!!!!! if they ever make an actual anime out of this I won't survive his fluffiness!!!!
86,"Feb 9, 2022",I kinda feel bad for Bihyeong 😢
86,"Feb 9, 2022",I thought Bihyeong was a gonner but he just shrink... still glad that he's alive cause thanks to him for helping Dokja 
86,"Feb 9, 2022",what a loser that black dokkaebi is. leave my Bihyeong alone. :/
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Poor Bihyeong!!!!
86,"Feb 9, 2022",webtoon translations are always garbage no offense it completely changes the seriousness of a scene ND it's meaning entirely 🤦🏻‍♂️
86,"Feb 9, 2022",What a bit*h 😒
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Hopefully he's not gonna just leave bihyeong like that! and I wish that red demon gets what he deserves for making bihyeong cry like that
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Dokja is so sly and witty that WE KNOW that he's not going to betray bihyung and just do some physical and mental abuse to that red dokkaebi. 
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Bihyeong didn't need to become smol and cute 🥺
86,"Feb 9, 2022",BIHYUNG IS SO CUTE WTF
86,"Feb 9, 2022",I can't wait to see what comes next! 😏
86,"Feb 9, 2022",I thought Dokja wasn’t going to go to his personal space?
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Dokja doesn’t betray his fri- patron like that
86,"Feb 9, 2022",I need a Bihyeong plushie
86,"Feb 9, 2022",man I actually feel bad for Bihyeong
86,"Feb 9, 2022","Congrats, you just made this personal."
86,"Feb 9, 2022",Huh? Was MC really in a position to prevent the Catastrophy so easily those three times?
86,"Feb 9, 2022",I sense that that dudes fur is gonna be a diffrent kinda red soon

86,"Feb 9, 2022","OI, DOKGAK! QUIT BULLYING MY BESTIE BIHYEONG ヽ(≧Д≦)ノ"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",ahh the novel readers know whats up .. haha
86,"Feb 9, 2022","Dokja specifically hasn't chosen a constellation because you can't kill them if you do right? or am I thinking of another toon?
anyway, I believe after all the power up fights lately, Dokja will be killing his first Dokkaebi soon"
86,"Feb 9, 2022",this dokkaebi-
86,"Feb 9, 2022","is he gonna go screw with this new dude's channel, and cost him everything?"
86,"Feb 9, 2022","Guys... If you think Dokja is gonna do something obvious, it probably isn't gonna be that. I want to say ""don't worry about it"" but... knowing how Dokja really is, just brace yourselves"
86,"Feb 9, 2022","I don't think Dokja can break the contract with Bihyeong. He's also not going to just roll over for Dokgak, or he'd be seriously breaking character from what we've seen. He hasn't killed anyone human to this point, and has spared some non-humans even, so it's not that odd. He's the King of No Killing. And he's hesitated many times as well. It's not abnormal to question his strength, or hesitate deciding on the right move."
86,"Feb 9, 2022",UGH I REALLY HATE THAT DOKGAK. HE USED DOKJA'S CONTEMPLATION AS A MANIPULATION 
86,"Feb 9, 2022",smoll bihyeong kinda cute ngl

86,"Jan 5, 2022",Imagine if Dokja is actually joining Dokgak and it’s not some plan or ploy lol
86,"Jan 5, 2022",Wait didn't he have an item that decrease his strength if he kills anyone. Couldn't he just show them that.
86,"Jan 5, 2022","oooof so close to the chapter I want!!! this one though, I didn't expect bihyeong being that damn cute... where was the evil bashfulness we had in the beginning?! lol I know why, and that's all in the book. lol"

86,"Jan 5, 2022","Yes the constellations are Angry at this breach of educate, more importantly of the red ones interference! "
86,"Jan 5, 2022",Well then I guess petty is as petty does.

86,"Jan 5, 2022",One of the personalities of The Constellation [Lazy Broke Weeb] is rejoiceful that many a toxic constellations have left Biheong's stream. A personality of [Lazy Broke Weeb] cheers Dokja through Biheong's stream. 5 coins have been sponsored.
86,"Jan 5, 2022","I really don’t care if Bihyeong loses the channel or not. Lets not forget the dude actively murdered people, and delighted in doing so. They’re all monsters, what does it matter if he betrays the dude?"
86,"May 12, 2022",I haven't forgotten that Bihyeong exploded people's heads at the beginning of the scenario simply because they were being rowdy. He can shrink until he disappears for all I care.

86,"Apr 6, 2022",bro 2 of those 3 people he didn't kill were human. if he would have killed them he'd have broken his non killing contract. plus he did kill the overgrown bug. it's just that it was too late. botted webtoon writing i swear 🙄
86,"Feb 10, 2022",He’s a demon thing who forced people to kill each other. Dokja has gotten what he needs from Bihyeong so there’s no point in helping him 
86,"Feb 10, 2022","Bihyeong is a sadistic, self-centered and cruel monster, yet y'all are really out here sad because he got smaller and cried lol"

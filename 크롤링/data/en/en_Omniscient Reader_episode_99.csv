Episode,Date,Review
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Kim Dokja: *literally has a donut hole in his torso*Yoo Joonghyuk: IT'S NOT TOO LATE!!!
99,"Apr 6, 2022",* slaps chair * EMOTIONAL DAAAMAGE
99,"Apr 6, 2022","🎶Guess whos dead, dead again🎶"
99,"Apr 6, 2022","""Dont get in my way, Dokja. Unless you want to die"" well, he was right. "
99,"Apr 6, 2022",I was surprised to see Junghyeok actually concerned for Dokja🤔
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Not Dokja being so dramatic just for him to respawn once again
99,"Apr 6, 2022","[The Constellation 'Omniscient Donut' is currently selling donuts, order yours now.]"
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Junghyeok is great at everything except he’s an idiot. Sounds like every isekai protagonist ever. 
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Kim Dokja? ❌❌ Kim Donutja ✅✅
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Sometimes you really do forget that Yoo Jungyook is an even bigger idiot that Dokja.
99,"Apr 6, 2022",i feel like omniscient reader is the name that dokja will claim if/when he becomes a constellation. (also sorry if i miss spelled somethin)
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Dokja really played hero because he knew exactly how it would turn out every step he has planned that man is playing 3d chess while everyone else is playing 2D checkers 
99,"Apr 6, 2022","You've been itching to kill Dokja this whole time, and NOW you hesitate?"
99,"Apr 7, 2022","“I’ve been trying to kill you for 97 episodes, please don’t die 😭😭😭”"
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Joonghyuk’s face tho. Hes so sad about his husbands death😭 what we gonna do?!
99,"Apr 6, 2022",At a loss for words Art is stunning as always
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Man really lovescosplaying huh. First as yjh and now a talking donut
99,"Apr 6, 2022",that moment where dokja takes the chance to tell junghyeok to kill him now; really encompass his bastard energy
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Characters when they die: 💀🔫🗡🏨Kim Dokja: 🍩🍩🍩
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Junghyeok actually cares about Dokja? he's been playing hard to get this whole time!!!
99,"Apr 6, 2022","He's dead, (reads next line) NEVER MIND HE LIVES, (reads next line) nope he's dead, (reads next line) HES ALIVE.... I think"
99,"Apr 6, 2022","At least Junghyeok had the decency to look like he feels guilt or panic or upset over Dokja appearing to be dying. Also Dokja cut that really close, Junghyeok then was the 100th person he saved in order to revive, wonder if he still would have done it if he'd only had 98 instead of the 99 saved karma points."
99,"Apr 6, 2022",The last scene before he died with Junghyeok going full panic mode was amazing.
99,"Apr 6, 2022",he really does care about dokja even when he had a hole in his torso
99,"Apr 6, 2022","Junghyeok should've listened to him, I get why he didn't though since he doesn't know just who Dokja is. Damnit tho he's so stubborn, if Dokja has been right so far and a good ally then you should at least heed his warnings or keep them in mind🤦🏽‍♀️"
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Saving hubby cuz you know he's stupid... Rip
99,"Apr 6, 2022",THIS IS ME NATSUMI_I. I LITERALLY CHANGED MY NAME JUST FOR THIS SPECTACLE. I CAN SAY THIS IS WORTH IT
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Well that’s the end folks. Thanks for watching. 
99,"Apr 6, 2022",She looks concerned? Maybe  she recognizes Dokja?
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Roll Credits.
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Dokja just calling panicking Joonghyuk a bastard while dying for him is just their entire relationship summed up perfectly 
99,"Apr 6, 2022","Honestly, nice to see that rhe authors thought of a way for Junhyeok's actions in his past regression to bite him in the as*"
99,"Apr 14, 2022",[ERROR MESSAGE] [Insufficient coins. You cannot access this stream. Kindly replenish your coins.]
99,"May 4, 2022",yoo jonghyuk after kdj wakes up: 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
99,"Apr 6, 2022","People are too hard on Junghyeok. They're talking about his 40th life here. Imagine thinking your efforts may very well save the world, yet failing and dying so many times. He's forced to recreate every bond he's ever made, he might be stupid but he should be praised for at least not giving up and going insane."
99,"Apr 6, 2022",You Joonghyuk looked so surprised for Kim Dokja sacrifice and looked terrified at the thought of him dying. 
99,"Apr 6, 2022",This scene was emotional to me. Like yjh doesn't want Dokja to die and shows concern and expressions that he is scared
99,"Apr 6, 2022","*Record scratch* ""yup, that's me. you're probably wondering how I ended up with a giant hole in my lower abdomen..."""
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Dude literally got eviscerated and Junghyeok was just standing there like ‘Nooo don’t die you’re so sexy :((‘
99,"May 11, 2022","""Junghyeok is an idiot who has to die hundreds of times to just barely reach the ending!"" hahahahaha well, when you put it like that"
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Can we appreciate how Dokja loves the story and its characters?
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Dokja is just Junghyeok’s poor PR manager dealing with the constant abuse caused by Junghyeok’s shenanigans 
99,"Apr 6, 2022",that concerned look on his face Yep tsundere junghyeok confirmed
99,"Apr 22, 2022",congrats on ur second death bro👍
99,"Apr 6, 2022","""its not too late"" GOD SEEING THIS DRAWN OUT IS MAKING ME😭😭"
99,"Apr 6, 2022","God damn it, listen to Dokja for once."
99,"Apr 6, 2022",kim dokja stigma : self sacrifice
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Novel MC: *makes me face palm bc he's stupid edgy n needs to die 100000 times to get to the end*actual MC: *makes me face palm for consistently doing MC things*
99,"May 11, 2022",I hate that no top comment is mentioning that in the novel when dokja asks yjh to kill him bc he will earn coins if he does it yjh said “... I can’t” he said he can’t kill dokja come onnn ಥ_ಥ why no one is mentioning this 
99,"Apr 6, 2022",junghyeok: you bastard you can't die I'm the one who's going to kill you!
99,"Apr 6, 2022","""I despise u for living for yourself"" that is NOT true. YJH is NOT living for himself, heck, he is NOT even living for others. He's continuing the cycle of regression for the sake of the world itself. He wants to change sth- ANYTHING. That is why the 41st!YJH lost his mind and did that awful thing to SYS. 41st!YJH wanted to see a change. He used a spear instead of his sword, he pushed through the scenarios to the limit and acted differently to desperately make THAT change... but he still failed."
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Dokja being practical kill me and get the coins for that bounty quest since I can come back 😂 mans is like run me that money 
99,"Apr 9, 2022","Wow!! That was really selfless of Dokja to do. I’m actually surprised to see Junghyeok genuinely concerned for him too. But the fact that Dojka didn’t hesitate to step in the way so Junghyeok could live was absolutely heroic. But aside from that, I think Dokja knew he’d come back because of the Immortal King skill. This episode slaps!!! And I can’t wait for the next!"
99,"Apr 26, 2022",Just a small flesh wound
99,"May 11, 2022","""you are causing your teammates great distress by having them watch you die twice now, please stop"" kim dokja: this sign cannot stop me because i cannot read! 😁😁😁😁"
99,"May 11, 2022","I'm a little disappointed with how they translated things in this chapter on Webtoon. Props to the translators though I know it isn't easy to interpret a message, but I just personally like the other translation better with the line Catastrophe Yooseong said to Junghyeok, rather than ""I despise you for living only for yourself"" she says ""I hate you for living like you're alone in this world"". I think it fits better with Junghyeok's way of thinking."
99,"Apr 6, 2022","Joonghyuk looks so scared when Dokja is dying, oughhhhhh my heart 😭"
99,"Apr 6, 2022",There’s been so many cliffhangers in this series I’m thinking we’re climbing down Mount. Everest
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Dokja is really suicidal 🥲
99,"May 11, 2022","Wrong translation again! IMMORTAL KING should be KING OF NO KILLING.
 It's the whole point of the attribute that no one would want it. "
99,"Apr 22, 2022",Somebody put a death counter on this man.
99,"Apr 13, 2022","in the novel YJH says in his last words to KDJ that he cannot kill him
which makes the scene so much better"
99,"May 11, 2022","This chapter hit hard. Yoo Joonghyuk, who acts like a self righteous, heartless prick is showing such emotion over Kim Dokja death. I can only imagine how confused and pissed he’ll be when he sees naked Dokja picking up his clothes after reviving himself 😂😂😂"
99,"Apr 14, 2022","This version of Shin Yoosung breaks my freaking heart 💔 Thousands of years spent alone in a terrible maze, it would drive anyone to insanity T^T"
99,"May 11, 2022",Nobody:  Dokja: why pass the scenario when you can just pass away
99,"Apr 6, 2022",But like junghyeok concerned for dokja😏😏
99,"Apr 6, 2022",My main man over here is about to pull a pro gamer move
99,"Apr 7, 2022",Dokja better get the bounty for killing himself.
99,"Apr 6, 2022","Dokja reminding Jooghyuk that he is an idiot for not listening to the ""prophet"" right next to him."
99,"Apr 6, 2022","*Dokja dies* yeah, average thursday "
99,"Apr 6, 2022","I thought he was supposed to be a pro gamer, not an idiot ._. "
99,"Apr 7, 2022",KIM DOKJA I DO NOT HAVE MY OWN FOURTH WALL TO LESSEN MY OWN SHOCK 😭😭😭
99,"Apr 8, 2022","ah yes, this is the first time I cried for him in the novel 💀"
99,"Apr 6, 2022",His reaction to Dokjas death is only gonna further push the constellations ship of them further along the sea of romance 
99,"Apr 6, 2022","The Catastrophe of Floods has just earned 80,000 coins...."
99,"Apr 6, 2022",I guess you can say he's half the man he once was😉
99,"May 11, 2022",Yoo joonghyuk really be giving attitude to the girl he put in the labyrinth of worlds for 400 YEARS
99,"Apr 6, 2022",tbh it's cool to see he cares for dokja and the catastrophe being confused why he would sacrifice himself for such a rotten dude is crazy 
99,"Apr 6, 2022","Dokja: *Does a noble sacrifice* Everyone: ""Oh no!"" Dokja: ""Sicke, I'm immortal"""
99,"Apr 6, 2022",ah man does that mean his cool jacket is gonna be gone
99,"May 4, 2022",oh hey would you look at that
99,"May 12, 2022",I dont think hes a donut since the hole is not in the middle a croissant maybe? 🥐
99,"May 12, 2022",mans missing his intestines and joonghyuk still yelling “I CAN FIX HIM”
99,"May 11, 2022","If you wont let your bro finish you off, then were you really bros to begin with ?"
99,"May 4, 2022","lol why am I still so emotional. I mean, I already knew what would happen, and already saw that scene. So why?"
99,"Apr 16, 2022",Note to self: screenshot Dokja's facepalm once the episode unlocks
99,"Apr 8, 2022","webtoon translators with the ""Immortal King"" again smh.. here goes another mistranslation report.."
99,"May 12, 2022",that was an amazing episode goddamn
99,"May 11, 2022","junghyeok ""it's not to late, it's never too late."" Dokja ""even if you say, it'll be all right. still hear me say, bro end my life. I've got minute left to stay alive. get some coins to turn this around because it's not too late. it's never too late."""
99,"May 11, 2022",this guy deserves a punch in the head for thinking he knows better than someone who can tell him what's going to happen
99,"Apr 10, 2022",“Can you finish me off? You always wanted to do it.” Damn man that just hurt and you could tell that he was surprised so much 
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Junghyeok’s concern really caught me by surprise 🤣
99,"May 11, 2022",Only dokja would be thinking of coins while actively dying 
99,"Apr 9, 2022","Donut worry, I'm sure Dokja will soon be hole again. Seeing Junghyeok worried for him is the icing on the cake."
99,"Apr 6, 2022",I wonder if this will be what it takes for Junghyeok to finally listen to him 🙃
99,"May 12, 2022",lmao i didn't realize this was the chapter where donutja was born i literally ate donuts before reading this chapter :') 
99,"May 12, 2022","Dokja *has a looking hole in his stomach*Joonghyuk ""Tis but a flesh wound"""
99,"May 11, 2022",dokja really just pulled a rengoku
99,"Apr 6, 2022","Let's board together the train of sadness, shall we? 😭"
99,"May 12, 2022","the skill, *plot armor*,is taking effect"
99,"May 11, 2022","So we got ace, rengoku, and now dokja joining donut club! What a pleasant addition😋"
99,"May 11, 2022",STOP WITH THE DONUT JOKES ISTG 😭😭😭
99,"Apr 20, 2022",this is the first time I've come this far ahead thanks to free coins but oh no this is too addicting ;-;
99,"Apr 6, 2022",looking forward 2 the dokja death counter
99,"May 12, 2022","""you have died."" NO KIDDING! I NeVeR wOuLd HaVe GuEsSeD tHaT"
99,"May 11, 2022",Forgot about that immortal king skill. Well played sir
99,"May 11, 2022",I didn't think the hole would be that big. I feel like my very heart has been taken away. I know he has King of No Killing. It's still so sudden when I scrolled though.
99,"May 11, 2022","Junghyeok's reaction was unexpected, the ""Demonic Judge of Fire"" is probably having a field day with Junghyeok's reaction. 💀 Where them coins? 🤲 I still remember what happened when Dokja helped Junghyeok when he was poisoned. 🤣"
99,"May 11, 2022",That time i got reincarnated as a scammer
99,"May 11, 2022",Dokja dies. Me: *Shocked Pikachu face*
99,"May 18, 2022",Why do I keep rereading the part where Dokja becomes a donut…..
99,"May 13, 2022",MY FAVORITE ARC IS HERE AAAHHSKASHKAHDJSJE
99,"May 12, 2022",To everyone making donut jokes in the comments. I hate you. Take my like. T-T
99,"May 12, 2022",JUNGHYEOK IS A FUCKING IDIOT
99,"May 12, 2022",I almost cried cause I forgot who he was 🥲
99,"May 11, 2022",Welcome to the donuts squad
99,"May 11, 2022",omg I forgot he's already died before and was freaking tf out that they'd actually doughnutted the MC
99,"May 11, 2022","Na this man was like ""I guess this is goodbye Junghyeok"" when he knew all along he can respawn that bastard"
99,"May 11, 2022",even after all that protesting ...they still translated it to immortal king. man i wanna stop reading on eng webtoon. 
99,"May 9, 2022","Dokja Kim: You said you wanted to kill me, do it now. You'll earn coins too!Yoo Joonghkyuk: NO! YOU CAN STILL BE SAVED!
Meanwhile with the girl
Joonghyuk: Give me information, I don't care about what you went through
The girl: Well screw you too I guess"
99,"Apr 11, 2022",when u dying but you tell your bestie to kill you so they get coins
99,"May 25, 2022","""Yoo joonghyeok is an idiot who has to die hundreds of times just to barely reach the ending"" dam, no mercy- also. That basically means... yoo junghyeok. Is an overpowered. Protagonist bubbled. IDIOT WITH HIGH STATS??? NO WONDER NO ONE WANTED TO READ IT. MOST PEOPLE WOULDNT WANT AN IDIOT REPETITIVELY DYING AND REVIVING, TRYNA MAKE IT TO THE END NO MATTER THE PLOT!! I mean, i prolly would, but that besides the point-"
99,"May 13, 2022",Junghyeok…hate to break it to you but he’s going to be fine lmao calm down— do you really think that THE Kim Dokja would do that so carelessly and just die? (I mean he would but you don’t know that and it’s beside the point lol) He’s like a cockroach in the best way possible— he just doesn’t die and keeps coming back haha
99,"May 12, 2022",i feel like this is the moment when they truly started caring for each other
99,"May 12, 2022",Honestly forgot he had immortal king power 
99,"May 12, 2022","Look at that, dokja x junghyeok is becoming more and more real"
99,"May 12, 2022","So your telling me right now that he’s just going to hit the respawn button like a true gamer, right?"
99,"May 11, 2022",Im absolutely living for that bastards panicky face but also can't help windering: when did Dokja crank up that saving karma? I don't recall him saving anyone.
99,"May 11, 2022",my ✨obsession✨ with this story is beyond understanding.
99,"May 11, 2022","Junghyeok has the power to reset while Dokja has the power to respawn. Dokja is making good use of his power, he probably has a premium account if this was a game XD #SaveDonutja"
99,"May 11, 2022",Jungheok actually cared for Dokja 😭😭😭💖💖 not him actually showing genuine distraught when he’s hurt after threatening to kill him hundreds of times prior 
99,"May 11, 2022",Time to keep track. Kim Dokja death count: 2 
99,"May 11, 2022",I look pretty good for a dead bitch 😏- Dokja
99,"May 11, 2022",yhk: ITS NOT TOO LATE !!!also dokja: 🍩
99,"May 4, 2022",first it was rengoku now it’s dokja with the donut jokes 😭😭 I can’t take their deaths seriously anymore 
99,"Apr 11, 2022",KIM DOKJA YOU MADLAD
99,"Apr 7, 2022","Sick and tired of this guy dying, he can't keep himself alive for 5 seconds and it will bite him in the ass later on I swear 😔"
99,"Apr 6, 2022","KDJ Death Count: 2 (king of no killing, donut)"
99,"Apr 6, 2022","*looks left, looks right* uhhh, calculated?"
99,"Apr 6, 2022",ready for an angry depressive emo yu junghyeok bcause of dokja's dead
99,"Jul 13, 2022",these btches gay 
99,"May 30, 2022","Novel readers are like ""Dokja is dead! Oh no! Anyway"" "
99,"May 18, 2022",of course only Dokja would think about coins as he dies
99,"May 18, 2022","OH, now I remember why I wanted to change my username!"
99,"May 18, 2022",Flip the art is so beautiful. Ughhhh. Another thing that’s beautiful: YJH’s love for our KDJ 😍
99,"May 17, 2022",okay ik this is half way a parody but like.. who writes this?? You mean to tell me joonghyuk sent shin to the past from his 41st round to meet him in his second round even though the 'rounds' are him repeating his past over and over again? IN WHAT WORLD does that make sense? How can he send her to a past that isnt actually a past because he repeats it in each round. WHERE IS THE LOGIC
99,"May 14, 2022",JUNGHYEOK YU IS A FCKING IDIOT
99,"May 14, 2022","yaknow what would've been a deadline cliffhanger? ""You died"" and then nothing else. glad that didn't happen."
99,"May 14, 2022","""don't come in my way dokja unless you want to die"" i guess that statement was true huh?"
99,"May 14, 2022",Ain’t gonna lie I completely forgot he had that ability
99,"May 13, 2022",He’s the only donut I’ll like 🥺💖
99,"May 12, 2022",OMG GAAAAAWD I HAVE GOOOOSE BUMBS ALL OVER MY BODY HELL FUCKING YEAHHHH
99,"May 12, 2022",I forgot he died already in the dragon fight
99,"May 12, 2022",and this is the beginning of Kim Dokja being a suicide maniac
99,"May 12, 2022",I admit I started laughing when Junghyeok was freaking out bc I just asked myself “Wait what about the ‘King of no killing’ skill? Doesnt he still have that?” AND I WAS RIIIIGHT but that had me worried for a moment- EVEN THE CONSTELLATIONS WERE SILENT! NO DING OF “[Constellation] IS SHOCKED”
99,"May 12, 2022",He won’t die we know it lol. When your the lead you never die 
99,"May 12, 2022",dojka and joonghyuk are truly clown for clown. i love them both.
99,"May 12, 2022",Kim Dokja pulling the rengoku on us
99,"May 12, 2022",the art i want to marry the art
99,"May 12, 2022",AGGHH IM GLAD HE HAS THE IMMORTAL KING ABILITY AND OMFG IM SORRY BUT I SHIP THEM SO BAD IM SO SORRYYY
99,"May 12, 2022",BYE I FORGOT HE COULD COME BACK TO LIFE I CRIED FOR NOTHING IM GONNA GET HIM 😭😭 CAN HE CHILL FOR LIKE TWO SECONDS FR
99,"May 11, 2022",So... Junghyeok was the 100th person he saved since the fight with the dragon? XD
99,"Apr 7, 2022",Even the Catastrophe was surprised when Dokja died 😳
99,"Apr 6, 2022",This is to good I can’t wait for the next episode 
99,"Apr 6, 2022","dokja: kill me, i know u always wanted toojoonghyuk: no it’s not to late i changed my mind, i don’t wanna kill u anymore
dokja: well shit. that sucks for u bc i’m dead now lol
also dokja: *u are the immortal king and your karma points are 100/100 so u get to live lol* sike bitch i lived"
99,"Apr 6, 2022",It would be meta af if dokja killed himself to claim the bounty on his own head-
99,"Apr 6, 2022",grown yoosung is so pretty😭😭💔
99,"Jul 8, 2022","Bruhhh, I forgot about the Immortal King revive he had 😫 I was confused why they killed the MC, and now I'm worried he's about him being naked again "
99,"Jun 2, 2022",I have gained Anxiety.
99,"May 31, 2022",yoo joonhyuk to lee seolhwa: HELP ME WIFES IN LABOR
99,"May 25, 2022",Dokja saw rengoku at the donut shop
99,"May 22, 2022","Dokja: Literally dies a painful death saving a fool and experience what must have been a quite traumatizing, to say the least, event. The fandom: ~Doknnut~"
99,"May 19, 2022",I can feel the donut jokes coming. It’s like Rengoku all over agin 🤧
99,"May 19, 2022",Dokja really said 🍩

99,"May 17, 2022","So we're gonna ignore the ""Immortal King"" part? cool cool "
99,"May 16, 2022",i don't think the fourth wall has nullified any of my emotional shock
99,"May 14, 2022",omg junghyeok (?) was so concerned that's so cute aaaaah
99,"May 14, 2022",This is nerve wrecking being a broke reader. Always 5+ chapters behind yet still wanting to read nonstop.

99,"May 12, 2022","So in the TWSA novel that Dokja read, Junghyeok would die in the 3rd round killed by Yuseung?"
99,"May 12, 2022","Dokja's final words ""It is you bastard"""
99,"May 12, 2022",I wanna hit somebody real bad...
99,"May 12, 2022",JESUS FUCKING CHRIST HE GOT RIPPED
99,"May 12, 2022",Joonghyuk better stfu and listen to everything Dokja tells him from now on 
99,"May 12, 2022",that was one hell of a ride
99,"May 12, 2022",that no killing king tittle can come handy sometimes
99,"May 12, 2022",now that's what I call and everyone say it with me (plot armor)
99,"May 12, 2022",I had a freaking heart attack dude.  Completely forgot he had that skill.

99,"May 11, 2022","I just want to scream, I love this part "
99,"May 11, 2022",Literally forgot about his immortal stuff. Was fully expecting him to die 
99,"May 11, 2022",okay but did junghyeok get the life insurance donutja told him to get?

99,"May 11, 2022","OMG, what is happening? "
99,"May 11, 2022","I was so sad when he was dieing, BUT ONCE I SAW JUNGHYEOKS FAC3 I GOT SO EXCITEDD!!!!"
99,"May 11, 2022",is dokja gonna be naked after re-living again?
99,"May 11, 2022",Wth it's Immortal King again? Didn't they changed it to The King of No Killing? What is even happening...
99,"May 11, 2022","Dokja: ARE YOU KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW!!!, I'm about to die, have no lungs and you think being nice for once will help at all, ugrh brb."
99,"May 11, 2022",joonghyuk you look so dramatic..
99,"May 11, 2022",Dokja cosplaying Rengoku
99,"May 11, 2022","I'm can't remember clearly but doesn't he go naked when he respawns? 😏. And this time, with Jungheok around "
99,"May 11, 2022",Damn i need to know what happens!!!! if i use coins I'll have nothing to read for weeks!!! the temptation aaaaaaaaaa
99,"May 11, 2022",Dunkin Donut? nah Dunkin Dokja
99,"May 11, 2022",That hole in Dokja's body was so shocking until I remembered his ability. Of course he'd think about the coins even then lol. And I think it's pretty interesting how Junghyeok basically created this catastrophe and he thought it was a good idea. I wonder if his future self did any other things like this
99,"May 11, 2022",reminds me of akaza making a donut hole in rengoku or dio making a donut hole in kakyoin
99,"May 11, 2022",last panel of dokja was ❤🔥🔥🔥❤
99,"May 11, 2022",Bro's a donut now ig
99,"May 4, 2022",scribble scribble
99,"Apr 30, 2022",Aha not me rewatching the panel in which Junghyuk cares for Dokja again and again. I'm so gay for them...
99,"Apr 29, 2022",dojka = 🍩
99,"Apr 19, 2022","You'd think he'd have figured out by now that Dokja literally knows what's going to happen, like... How are you gonna continue to ignore someone you KNOW knows the future and then act all surprised when sh*t goes bad... Come on Junghyeok, you're better than this"
99,"Apr 17, 2022",I love this so much
99,"Apr 13, 2022",He wouldn't be so concerned about our boy Dokja if he knew what Omnicient Readers Viewpoint level three let's him do...
99,"Apr 12, 2022",Who else forgot that he has a revive skill?

99,"Apr 8, 2022",You had one job!!
99,"Apr 7, 2022","ya know, not to be horrible, but dokja's spine was gone. he should have literally filled over in half, instead of being able to hold up his body weight. yeah it's morbid, but ""ReAlIsM"""
99,"Apr 7, 2022","Another set of clothes that goes to waste. Poor Dokja, he just put that set xd"

99,"Apr 6, 2022",Damn. Story get better every time I check it. Now I can't wait to see Joonghyuk face when Dokja reanimate himself.. Can he kill him again for a heart attack he had this time?? 😂
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Did the Catastrophe recognize him? Or was she just shocked someone stuck their neck out for Junghyeok?
99,"Apr 6, 2022",me:knows about the reserection skillalso me:no dojika don't die
99,"Apr 6, 2022","I was SUPER worried until I remembered that reincarnation skill. Damn, this had me on the edge of my seat."

99,"Sep 9, 2022",it's rare to see joonghyuk being positive like that
99,"Sep 5, 2022","I love that no matter how much Junghyeok may hide it, he still values life. And I think he values Dokja a lot because he’s the one anomaly, one being, who stood next to him as an equal, a companion. They never said it but I think Junghyeok is grateful for Dokja for many things. Also wanted to add that Jung had “thoughts” Dokja read that didn’t seem complete (when Jung was poisoned and figured out Dokja could read minds, almost) (continued in replies)"
99,"Sep 3, 2022",Donut core
99,"Sep 3, 2022",I am starting to ship Junghyeong and Dokja

99,"May 13, 2022",bruh he was so concerned for dokja when he just shoved him off a few minutes ago
99,"May 13, 2022","now this is interesting , the catastrophe of floods must be wondering why dokja defended him"
99,"May 13, 2022",why is no one talking about the LITERAL hundreds of years of loneliness and pain that shin yuseung (the catastrophe) went through like holy shit that part was grim
99,"May 12, 2022",this hurt my heartu :<
99,"May 12, 2022","Dang he’s like rengoku now, except he can come back"
99,"May 12, 2022","Kim Dokja: *cough up blood*Yoo Joonghyuk: IT'S NOT TO LATE!!
Me: I just realized..... Joonghyuk is wearing a black coat and Dokja is wearing a white coat.... Doesn't that sounds familiar? Like the bride of a wedding wears white while the groom or husband idk what is called, but their wearing black.... Is Dokja and Joonghyuk finally getting married??"
99,"May 12, 2022","I just love the orv fandom. Yall so funny 😂Edit: Anyways, I feel like I just finished reading the prologue. It looks like this is just the beginning."
99,"May 12, 2022",Man must be a pain to be restricted to not kill anyone 
99,"May 12, 2022",forgot he got that skill where he help 100 people and he have another life lol
99,"May 12, 2022",I fricking hate Junghyeok...
99,"May 12, 2022",DOKJA FCKING DIES PART 2 LETS GOOOO
99,"May 12, 2022",only Dokja would think about coins even as he's dying
99,"May 12, 2022","Dokja: “I told you about your hardships you’ve experience in the past, and the sacrifices you made. I’ve even helped you in your times of need. Do you trust me?” Joonghyuk: “Yeaaah, nope. [ Joonghyuk uses skill: PRESSURE POINTS JAB”. 👉🏻]"
99,"May 12, 2022","forgot about that skill, how convenient that he's immortal on a technicality "
99,"May 12, 2022","can't wait for a next few arcs, damn it it's gonna take a few months, but whats to come is so worth it 🤭"
99,"May 12, 2022",KING OF NO KILLING! ❤️ 
99,"May 12, 2022","I completely forgot about that…XD, when he lost half his body I…dang death without death. I wonder how regressor is gonna react when he poofs Back into existence…"
99,"May 12, 2022",GODAMNIT STUPID STUPID STUPID DUMBASS WHY DID HE HAVE TO DO THAT
99,"May 12, 2022",Damn my guy became Rengoku
99,"May 12, 2022",Oh my gosh how am I going to make it to next Wednesday
99,"May 12, 2022",hah now everyone is laughing and making jokes cuz he can revive but one day when he die and couldn't come back the pain will be real...................... the story of that one reader we all knew 🥺🥺🥺 ... shit I'm crying again. 
99,"May 12, 2022","I forgot he had the immortal king skill lol,i was like, killing off the main character to save the supposed-to-be main character? bruh move"
99,"May 12, 2022",Got Kakyoined 
99,"May 12, 2022",That hole in his stomach actually made me jump
99,"May 12, 2022","Did he jumped in knowing he have enough karma points to resurrect? And Junghyeok could have earn coins too by finishing him off. Since that catastrophe of flood killed him,  does it mean she have all the coins for his bounty now?"
99,"May 12, 2022",Can't wait to see Uriel reaction... Tons of coins are about to be sponsored 
99,"May 12, 2022",✨✨im not crying..... im totally not crying✨✨

99,"May 11, 2022",i forgot he had that ability 💀
99,"May 11, 2022","Here we see how coin drive Dokja is. He can not let his dead go to waste when there's coin to be gained. To the point forgetting he made Junghyeok vowed to not kill him until the end of 5th scenario. You almost make Jungheok's heart spontaneously combust, you coin hoarding idiot. What happened to preventing the protagonist from regressing and erasing the world?"
99,"May 11, 2022","Although we see them as Joonghyeok being dumb sunfish, most of Joonghyeok's dumb moves are due to his arrogance and self-righteousness he developed during his past regressions. Dokja knows this and unedrstands his lonliness and mistakes even while resenting his behaviors."
99,"May 11, 2022","So, if I understand correctly: Junghyeok from his 41st round send Yuseung to the past and to the labyrinth so she could become a catastrophe and give his past self (1st round) information? So she did on his 1st round (unless he died before meeting her), and/or on his 2nd round as a second chance? And she was so traumatized that she killed herself afterwards. But since it's his 3rd round, she realizes that she gave him informations before and it didn't work so she goes berzerk?"
99,"May 11, 2022",Dokja needed guts to save Junghyeok.
99,"May 11, 2022",*missing lower half of intestines* “I CAN STILL FIX YOU” how? Going full cyborg or something?

99,"May 11, 2022","hmmm... mr,prettyboy, i see you actually care about him"
99,"May 11, 2022","Who are these “others” Yuseung refers to? I look forward to finding out in the future. Was waiting to see how long it’d take for the Immortal King skill to be utilized tho, and of course its due to Junghyeok’s stupidity lmaoo"

99,"Apr 6, 2022",Question: What is Dokja implying with YJH taste of woman?
99,"Apr 6, 2022",When did they add Rengoku to this series?

99,"Jul 21, 2022","I missed this at first-that The Catastrophe of Floods is the adult form of Beast Tamer Yuseung, whom Dokja just adopted as his Incarnation. Top commenter mentioned back in episode 95 that in the novel version of Omniscient Reader there are two important lines that are omitted from this comic version (not an exact transcription): Dokja: If you kill me now you can even gain coins. I'm already dying. Just kill me. Junghyeok makes a face like when he first met Dokja and replies: I can't do it."
99,"Jun 14, 2022",he's gonna lose his clothes again 💀💀💀

99,"May 12, 2022","Well, looks like it's over... I kid. I kid! Obviously he's coming back, and with vital information...but you know what? It seemed like the Catastrophe of Floods recognized him. So does that mean that the future she's from still reflects the changes he's made in the present?"
99,"May 12, 2022",Oh my goodness gracious.  They killed Dokja.  You jerk!
99,"May 12, 2022",Did he maybe do it to show Yuseung that yunghyeok actually cares for somebody besides himself?
99,"May 12, 2022",they say you have to loose something to know how much it's worth to you.. Junghyeok finally revealed his true feelings wasn't it just so romantic 😍😍

99,"May 11, 2022","Died while losing your intestine must be quite hurtful. Even when you knew you would revive. As much as I admire this amazing complex full-of-twist story and beautiful powerful art, I admire Kim Dokja a lot. I just wonder, how the author could make such character born in this long but not boring at all story. And Dokja grabs the key for it."
99,"May 11, 2022",🍩
99,"May 11, 2022","at first I hated jonghyuk and that attitude of his ,but just remember he's been through what she has 10 times 100 times 1000 times over and over that's why he's not as soft as people would want him to be"
99,"May 11, 2022","I see why only one person finished the novel, the MC is an idiot and a prick."

99,"May 11, 2022",its donutja for u
99,"May 11, 2022",This is gonna change things. My bet is that seeing Joonghyuk caring so much for Dokja will make the adult Yuseung think that atleast he has started caring for the people around him. And that will be a chance to turn things around.
99,"May 11, 2022","Dokja is becoming rengoku, if u get it you get it"

99,"May 11, 2022",All I'm worried about is if he does become a constellation as others say doesn't that mean Dokja won't be able to come to earth anymore? Like is that how it works?
99,"May 11, 2022",bruhhhh free pass jsut unlocked today how tf these comments from 6 April
99,"May 11, 2022",Man the next character to tell him he isn't handsome is getting kicked. 
99,"May 11, 2022","Damn Junghyeok actually cared about Dokja dying there. I figured he must care about (or respect) Dokja a bit because he only immobilized him from getting in the way with a simple poke, and then WARNED him about dying if he got in the way again. Junghyeok would usually just have killed, but Dokja is definitely growing on him! It’s pretty cute. 😊 Now he’s actually freaking out over Dokja dying. Bet he’ll be pissed when he sees Dokja can come back to life tho 😂 This Scenario lady is prob shooketh"
99,"May 11, 2022","GDI, Junghyeok. How do you lack so much damn empathy in only your third go round?"

99,"May 11, 2022",he's a really shitty ml lol
99,"May 11, 2022",I wonder if saving Junghyeok counted towards his karma points and gave him enough to earn another resurrection. At least he won't come back naked this time.
99,"May 11, 2022",Damn. Dead again? Oh dear...
99,"May 11, 2022",With nearly the entire family on the island and dokja dying - Avengers assemble (endgame) vibes: full on!

99,"May 11, 2022","Dokja, did you SERIOUSLY forget why you've been avoiding killing anybody? You forgot [immortal king]? More like [idiot king] now."
99,"May 11, 2022",🎵🎤🎸 Shot through the heart And you're to blame 🎶
99,"May 11, 2022","Writer of TWSA: I created a monster, cuz nobody wants to see Yunghyeok no more, they want Dokja I'm chopped liver... "

99,"May 11, 2022",Dokja out here with a damn good Rengoku cosplay
99,"May 11, 2022",Oh my god I forgot that was a thing 
99,"May 11, 2022",ay puta immortal king again
99,"May 11, 2022",Finally Junghyeok gets some shit for that attitude but also I wonder if he seemed shocked at Dokja's death because he 'cared' or because he didn't expect the betrayal
99,"May 11, 2022",idk why but I love the idea of someone coming back to like like that... I actually have my own story going with a similar thing... but my character is more crazy than cool...
99,"May 11, 2022",Singin'... I STILL FEEL ALIVVVEEEEEE AND IS HOPELESS~ I START TO NOTICE Also at first I though we were like gonna restart or switch protagonist or something like idk-
99,"May 11, 2022",YES!!! HE HAD ENOUGH POINTS!!!!!
99,"May 11, 2022","I’m not gonna lie, I read this in raws like 10 times and I swear this never failed to give me chills and I even cried, I know dokja can revive but it’s yjh reaction that really hits deep in the core, he cares, he cares for dokja"
99,"May 11, 2022",it said he saved 100 out of 100. meaning joonghyuk was the 100th. WHY???
99,"May 11, 2022",Bet Jugnheok will listen now won't he
99,"May 11, 2022","Well, didn’t see that coming…"

99,"May 11, 2022",Welcome to the donut club Kim Dokja! 
99,"May 11, 2022",I knew what will happen next but.. why.. why am i still crying? who's cutting onions 😭
99,"May 11, 2022","junghyeok screaming ""IT'S NOT TOO LATE!"" gives me serotonin "
99,"May 11, 2022",Junghyeok’s very out of character consideration towards dokja is kinda sketchy ngl
99,"May 11, 2022","this arrogant butthole, getting Dokja killed..."
99,"May 11, 2022","this guy is like a Mario bros Player using green mushrooms with that karma thing. The MC of TWTSA is like ""wait! why are u drying and why I care about you!? what's happening!!?"""
99,"May 11, 2022",Ace! dont be like this bruh TT
99,"May 11, 2022",🍩🍩🍩

99,"May 11, 2022",i hatter YOUUU WAHHHH 
99,"May 11, 2022","...I kinda hate Junghyeok right now. He made Yuseung go through so much, only for his own personal gain. Which I admit a lot of people would do if it meant surviving, but he doesn't seem to care for her AT ALL. I expect character growth from him."
99,"May 11, 2022",agh this cliffhanger makes me with i had money!
99,"May 11, 2022","Omg, he does look so cool"
99,"May 11, 2022",Demon slayer fans who watched rengoku vs akasa: ah shit here we go again 🤡

99,"May 6, 2022","Holy shit, fast passing was worth it. I forgot he was the immortal king which is a sign of amazing story telling damn, impressive."
99,"May 5, 2022",SOMEONE’S USERNAME REALLY NAMED AS DOKJA’S DEATH TALLY I

99,"Apr 6, 2022",anyone wants donuts? 🍩🍩🍩
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Kim Dokja is a strawberry glazed donut with a bite to the side. And no one can change my mind.
99,"Apr 6, 2022",RED JAM DONUTS WITH A BITE TO THE SIDE ARE THE BEST! 🍩🍩
99,"Apr 6, 2022",WHY IS THE RED JAM IN MY DONUT KIND OF BITTER? AND HAS THIS SORT OF METALLIC TASTE? I WANT A REFUND
99,"Apr 6, 2022",My favourite donut is the white one with confectionery sugar and red jam inside :D
99,"Apr 6, 2022",Why are donuts so darn delicious!?!?
99,"Apr 6, 2022","Furui from Naruto, Lancer from Fate Zero, Ace from One Piece, Rengoku from Demon Slayer and finally Kim Dokja from Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint..now now I wonder what the similarities of these characters are 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️ *eats donut 🍩*"
99,"Apr 6, 2022",🍩🍩🍩🍩
99,"Apr 6, 2022",-Dokja: Wait..I'm a donut? Rengoku-san: First time?

99,"May 16, 2022","Hello hello. I will be leaving for a while (as in a month? maybe more) But I will come back eventually. Indeed. I am going on a break from handling the comment section again. Good luck for the episodes to come, Nat."
99,"May 14, 2022","Junghyeok is an idiot, We thank the constellations that dokja has enough karma points to activate his immortal king ability again. I hope the others can take on the catastrophe of floods while Dokja is down."
99,"May 11, 2022",my guy gave me an heart attack and said YOLO life is going on

99,"May 11, 2022","Okie dokie, that escalated from 0 to 100 REAL quick! Also, it's funny how the readers of other series would go, ""OMFG NOOO PLS, MC DON'T DIIEE!!"" And proceed to get all anxious, whereas, us weirdos are just like, ""Yeah, he does this every Wednesday. Don't worry, he'll come right back looking as bare as a newborn."""

99,"May 11, 2022","Junghyeok finally realized how much he cares for Dokja, and that he screwed up following his old lover. I know Dokja was like dying and all- but all I could do was squeal about my ship."
99,"May 11, 2022",WHY IS THE LIKE TO COMMENT RATIO SO WEIRD TODAY. LOOK AT THE LIKES ON THIS CHAPTER. THERE ARE USUALLY MORE LIKES AT THIS POINT????
99,"May 11, 2022",Does his skill give him save points that he can come back to after he dies?
99,"May 12, 2022",DOKJA IS THE REAL MC HERE! THAT BLACK GUY IS SO STUPID JUST BECOUSE HES THE FAKE MC🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
99,"May 11, 2022","I fcking hate Junghyeok here so freaking much. When I first read this part in the novel I threw my phone away because of how frustrated I was lol. For a MC he's stupid as hell, no wonder he had to die so much just to get to the end of the novel."
99,"May 9, 2022",Lol so he's acting to show her that he cares about others? Bold move lol
99,"May 12, 2022",can i give spoiler he is gonna come back to life again and will work with yoo joonghyuk to defeat the catastrophe and she will be controlled by a dokkabie and will be killed by them 
99,"Apr 9, 2022",this was the most disappointing use of coins yet....  I dunno felt short and incomplete for some reason.  
99,"May 16, 2022",It probably wont be as bad being stuck in the labyrinth with her for a thousand years while clapping those cheeks.

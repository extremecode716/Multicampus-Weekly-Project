21,"Oct 16, 2020","dokja sees himself in gilyeong üò≠üò≠ of course his advice would be choosing to be sheltered away from the truth & escape into hope, cause thats exactly what he did while reading ways of survival"

21,"Oct 16, 2020",Gilyeong best boi 
21,"Oct 16, 2020",I love how there are wholesome (yet very real) moments; like Gilyeong and Dokja!
21,"Oct 16, 2020",I'd be happy to see if Mr. Han gets some sort of redemption arc. At the same time I'm not saying I'd be sad if he were hit by a bus. 
21,"Oct 16, 2020","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" is excited to see your next action.] [5 coins have been sponsored.]"

21,"Oct 16, 2020",I want to know what it‚Äôs saying lol
21,"Nov 11, 2020",I don't see Dokja as a bad guy for letting the kid stay optimistic even though he thinks he's a bad adult. It's clear he cares for the kid even though he tries to hide his emotions. His character is so simple yet so complex. Also the kid is freaking smart! I just really enjoy this WebToon. It's so well done! 
21,"Nov 11, 2020",I prefer Gilyeong to call Dokja as Hyung. Translator please keep the honorifics.

also that mr.han is worse than a child who is probly under the age of 13 "
21,"Nov 11, 2020","...Han is such a CREEP. He stole Sanga's bike to make her take a ride home with him, and when she didn't, he FOLLOWED HER TO THE SUBWAY??? Some characters really are made to be hated"
21,"Nov 11, 2020",Sun wukong(prisoner of the golden headband): GOD SOMEONE SHUT HIM UP. THANK YOU DOKJA HERE SOME COINS
21,"Nov 11, 2020",This is such a good adaptation I'm crying. I'm a huge fan of the novel and so far it did not disappoint at all. I always comment in the novel and I'm glad that people who read the webtoon are also checking out the novel. It's really great and is honestly one of the best with this kind of concept. Hope y'all stay with this till the end! Because it really is worth the wait :3

21,"Nov 11, 2020",That ain't a Dark warden. That's a high ranking Dementor. 
21,"Nov 11, 2020",bruh when one of the watchers said they didn't like Mr. Han I was like me too bruh me too
21,"Nov 11, 2020",The irony of him saying he isn't the protagonist while being the protagonist of this story.
21,"Nov 11, 2020","bro, dokja and gilyoung holding hands tho‚Äî im so soft??"
21,"Nov 11, 2020",Gilyeong is such a good smart boi 
21,"Nov 11, 2020","This is one of my fav stories in here, and if you guys are interested of actually reading the web novel it self I would say go for it! It‚Äôs quite a lengthy read but it depends on your taste :)). Plus it‚Äôs kinda frustrating to not tell the contents of the story, but I won‚Äôt spoil. You could say I‚Äôm Kim dokja."
21,"Nov 11, 2020",Dojka indirectly said shut up when he threw the spike.
21,"Oct 16, 2020",A fee has been added to see the next episode 
21,"Nov 11, 2020",Dang it ‚Äúgaaaw etur‚Äù isn‚Äôt working in google translate guys Edit: ok guys I found ‚Äúgaaw etur‚Äù and in Hindi it means ‚Äúvillage atur‚Äù which I think is a place in southwestern France

21,"Oct 16, 2020","I am pleased with these events, and have gifted you with 5 coins."
21,"Nov 13, 2020",petition to add honorifics to their names. because when gilyeong just says dokja without adding hyung just loses the intimacy üò≠üò≠üò≠
21,"Nov 11, 2020","Interesting. Weve learnt 2 new things about the constellations If a group a of them fall under a category like ""the constellations of absolute good"" then if they all do something they'll be referred to that way. I think. Also the Secretive Plotter doesnt like being out of the loop. I'm actually really curious what's going on with Secretive Plotter. He sounds like he'd be a great sponser if he went all in on you but otherwise he'd be way too conservative. "
21,"Nov 11, 2020","""a few constellations are beginning to tear up"" oh no, they caught me ü•∫ü§£"
21,"Nov 11, 2020",Constellations of the absolute Good alignment? Who force billions to die in agony for their own petty amusement? Guys I think we found the endboss. And the reason that our hero refuses to align with any of them.
21,"Nov 11, 2020","it feels so weird to see gilyoung call dokja by his first name,, i really wish they‚Äôd used the honorifics :(("
21,"Nov 12, 2020",Dokja adopting Gilyoung ü§©
21,"Nov 11, 2020","I really wish the translator keep the honorifics, the other webtoons still keeping the honorifics then why Omniscient Reader can't?"
21,"Jul 11, 2021","Please just let the child survive as long as possible. Out of all the supporting characters, the kid has the keenest sense of awareness and just a lovable disposition. Especially when compared to most of the awful or dim-witted adults. "
21,"Feb 12, 2021","I love how the main character in this isn't a saint,but merely a normal perosn wanting to survive in a corrupted world. He's not perfect,and can be selfish,but so can everyone else."
21,"Nov 12, 2020","i really hope gilyeong won't betray dokja in the end or at least don't die pls, i really like that kid "
21,"Nov 11, 2020","Like the prisoner of the golden headband, we grow tired of the petty argument as well"
21,"Nov 11, 2020",I feel like prisoner of the golden headband is probably super friggin funny and chill
21,"Nov 11, 2020","i really how there are supreme beings who just watch you as entertainment but because they want to see your deeds, demonic judgment of fire and golden headband are my favs!"
21,"Nov 11, 2020",Gilyeong is so precious omg
21,"Nov 11, 2020",the constellations be acting like us readers

21,"Sep 15, 2021",a few of the constellations tear up. big relate with the constellationsDokja and Gilyeong's relationship is becoming so precious. I hope nth happens to the precious bean üò≠
21,"Mar 17, 2021","The constellations are a whole mood especially the - ""Constellations are tearing up""  "
21,"Dec 6, 2020","your panels are probably the best I've seen in this format, you have really good pacing and the way you made the hole feel so completely dark was really foreboding and excellent. Genuinely adding a sense of dread for what was to come. I was hooked from episode 1 and am really looking forward to more :)"
21,"Nov 12, 2020","Oh, that's the first sign of actual emotion from Secret Plotter there, when it's revealed that Dokja is using everyone to get to the treasure trove...but he also knows that they'll be fine if he can get to them quickly so I'm more than fine with it, as long as they can all survive for longer! If Secret Plotter doesn't turn out to be an alternate timeline Dokja or another player from a previous timeline, I'll honestly be surprised."
21,"Nov 12, 2020","Gilyeong is my favorite character other than Dokja, but I like all of the characters surprisingly (well... not including Mr. Han..) but this is one of the few series where I actually love the mc. "
21,"Nov 11, 2020","WHY ISNT GILYOUNG CALLING DOKJA ""HYUNG/ELDER BROTHER""??!!! REALLY WISH THE TRANSLATOR WOULD READ THE WEBNOVEL TRANSLATIONS"
21,"Nov 11, 2020","The constellation [Obessed Procrastinating Teen] is gasping through the story. the constellation [Obessed Procrastinating Teen] is obsessed with the story and is procrastinating math to see what happens next. 
The constellation [Obessed Procrastinating Teen] wants to know if the little boy is 14 to 15 years of age, for research purposes, of course. "
21,"Nov 11, 2020",We are the constellations *cough cough* 
21,"Nov 11, 2020","I love the relationship between Gilyeong and Dokja, from the very beginning even if Dokja just wanted to team up with the kid in order to get points with the constellations, Gilyeong hold on to him in an adorable way and I just love to see whenever they interact no matter how small the moment is. "
21,"Nov 5, 2020","[ THE CONSTELLATION, TRUENEUTRALSPIRIT IS RESTLESS FOR MORE.][ YOU HAVE BEEN GIFTED 5 COINS.]"
21,"Nov 5, 2020",I was ready for the sub scenario from the constellations: We're sick of Mr. Han's shit. kill him.
21,"Oct 16, 2020",I love Gilyoung and Dokja‚Äôs relationship. It‚Äôs so precious. And when did they finally change Sanga to Sangah?? Did I just not notice? Thanks Webtoon. I wonder if there will be another coin event to catch up to simulcast ü§î
21,"Jul 28, 2021","i love all the constellations like they‚Äôre so amazing, dramatic, and funny. btw anyone knows what the warden was saying? oh and have a great day everyone! "

21,"Apr 28, 2021",I was here for the coin raid but now I‚Äôm here to see it through. I love this whole concept. 
21,"Apr 16, 2021",I feel a deep connection for the constellation as they tear up at Guilyeong
21,"Apr 13, 2021",isn't it funny how rn we're like the constellations? watching it all play out and giving coins...
21,"Mar 19, 2021",Dude!!!! The character design looks so good!!
21,"Dec 25, 2020",doesnt gilyeong remind u of bam from tog
21,"Dec 24, 2020",could it be that Gilyeong is the few early readers of TWSA or perhaps he read other series. somehow Dokja will meet those other early TWSA readers as well?
21,"Dec 18, 2020",(the constellation demonic judge of fire despises myeongo han) bro same
21,"Dec 2, 2020",if the kid dies imma quit
21,"Nov 13, 2020",who else was hoping that dokja threw the needle at han...
21,"Nov 12, 2020",Dokja: the blade is bluntMe: the blade is melted....
21,"Nov 12, 2020","also again, webtoon translaters PLEASE keep the honorifics!!! removing it takes out the emotion of the characters. plus so many characters call dokja ""ahjussi"" and ""hyung"" its gonna be weird without it"
21,"Nov 12, 2020",i really cant believe Dokja was called the Ugliest King-_-
21,"Nov 12, 2020",I like this kid he has main character but never will be main character energy 
21,"Nov 12, 2020","God, when this will turn to anime?"
21,"Nov 12, 2020",im not sure if what im saying is actually tru but i truly think that that kid could handle the truth. kids arent weak to such information but instead remember they r more adaptive than adults. i think the kid would just get shocked for a while but slowly accept it. although im not saying that he shouldve shared the truth w him but rather saying that that kid may be willing to handle the info
21,"Nov 12, 2020",Thor: Dokja don't make the same mistake I did AIM FOR THE D#MN HEAD
21,"Nov 11, 2020","Damn he missed, should of aimed for the head "
21,"Nov 11, 2020","Still can't get over how they made Gilyoung-ie call KDJ 'Dokja' with no honorifics... That's his hyung... Also his question to KDJ üò≥üò≥ SingShong once again, is so very smart"
21,"Nov 11, 2020",This comic is so stressful. I need to mr. Han to die already because he just adds so much stress and rage in me
21,"Nov 11, 2020","translator nim, please don't get rid of the honorific. I think it seems rude if gilyoung call dokja only by his name,since dokja much older than him. in the novel gilyoung always call dokja with ""hyung"" or ""Dokja Hyung"". and sangah too, it suppose ""sangah unni"". also the honorific-ssi, then ""noona"", ""ahjussi"", and the others. please add the honorific"
21,"Nov 11, 2020",[A FEW CONSTELLATIONS STARTED TO TEAR UP] ROFL!
21,"Nov 11, 2020","""I'm not the protagonist"" ah yes, LiEs aNd DecEiT"
21,"Jul 14, 2021","I‚Äôm a first time reader, so don‚Äôt judge me if I‚Äôm wrong, but what if the author was a regressor? What if the author purposefully started writing the original novel, and even continues writing it even if only Dokja read it, because he wanted to make sure that he was able to do something to save humanity? Maybe I‚Äôm just looking too far into it, but it‚Äôd be an interesting twist; finding out that the author knew what was going to happen, so he wrote the original novel."
21,"Jun 22, 2021",That kid is like the sweetest thing ever ‚ò∫Ô∏è. He's so optimistic and a lovable character. I really hope he gets to the end of the story.
21,"Apr 29, 2021",i want the kid to survive.. and I want Dokja to adopt him.. is it too much to ask for? yes. Will I take my request back? no.. I can only dream 
21,"Apr 28, 2021",I was here just because of the coin raid but nahh man I'm not leaving anytime soon.

21,"Feb 2, 2021",Myeongoh is a man who can't take no as an answer. and now he's blaming Sangah when he did all of that himself? scum
21,"Dec 3, 2020","this han bastard can go die. like wtf. i know so many people like him and they'll never admit what a terrible person they are. he stole her bike which is a crime,  because he wanted to drive her home probably because A-he thought they'd be closer B-he wanted to know where she lived and C-he's just a creep. instead of going home when she said no(because she didnt know him well and she was probably creeped out)he stalked her to the subway&he has the gall to blame her. he'd be dead if he was alone."

21,"Nov 13, 2020","I genuinely can't get a read on Dokja. He's extremely pragmatic. I really like that he isn't your typical hero, but I'm concerned he'll leave his friends for dead if it suited him."
21,"Nov 12, 2020",Warden Of The Dark needs a Snickers. He ain't himself when he's hungry.
21,"Nov 12, 2020","I prefer ""Hyung"" for the kid to say, instead of ""Dokja"" like the novel. like that it can feel more the kid attitude towards the MC. Or at least please put ""big brother"" or explain what means ""hyung"" ü§î"
21,"Nov 12, 2020","Honestly, you should just let Mr. Han die. I can't believe he's blaming Sangah for getting them all in this mess just because she chose not to go with him."
21,"Nov 12, 2020",100% sure that Mr. Han's constelation is king of the small fries

21,"Nov 12, 2020",I think we only keep Mr. Han as living bait. And Dokja was nice enough I think to let Gilyeong stay optimistic as sometimes I think people need it.

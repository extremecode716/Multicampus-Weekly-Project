9,"Aug 19, 2020",Spending all my coins
9,"Aug 19, 2020","Can't wait for it to catch up to Korean raws! Those that think this is similar to Solo Leveling, you're in for a big surprise... "
9,"Aug 19, 2020","Using my coins for this, everyone wants to be a part of the early squad! Anyway there are fan translations past this point, but remember to read it here only to support our lovely creators!"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I love how the protagonist isn't the TRUE protagonist. 
9,"Aug 19, 2020","I'm so, so happy that the webnovel translations are being used! It gives me such joy to see names like ""demon-like Judge of Fire"" and ""Secretive Plotter"" translated the way I remember them! "
9,"Aug 24, 2020",Anyone else think the secretive plotter is the author of the series he read?
9,"Aug 19, 2020","wait, Mori sent him a sponsorship offer?! Go for it, dude! "
9,"Sep 23, 2020","I can't decide if the ""main protagonist"" is good or bad- he's the protagonist of the story, but also Dokja seems very NOT EAGER to meet him. Also, I have a feeling that the secrative plotter will actually turn out to be super op or at least important"
9,"Aug 21, 2020",Coins: -30 Satisfaction: +3149
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Something makes me think that Secret Plotter was actually the best option... maybe the author of the story he was reading?
9,"Aug 20, 2020",“Do you still want to meet him?”. Lmao they changed their minds hella quick 😂
9,"Aug 19, 2020",Finally the ruthless mc I’ve always wanted along with the great artwork😁😁😁 high hopes for this one.
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Secretive Plotter might end up being big. My reader senses are working. 
9,"Sep 23, 2020","Wait so in the original TWSA that Dokja read, the main protagonist wasn't a hero!? Well shit that just means everyone is morally ambiguous now. "
9,"Aug 19, 2020",We'll be the constellations that sponsors kdj in his adventure by giving our coins 💞👌👌👌. Can't wait to see the 'protagonist'!! And thank you for staying true to the webnovel translation for the constellation modifiers
9,"Aug 19, 2020","
[Constellation, ""Sleep is for Me"" spent 25 coins to read this awesome webtoon.""]"
9,"Aug 24, 2020",Handsome Kim Dokja! 
9,"Sep 23, 2020","He always says or mentions that he’s the only reader of Ways of survival in like every sentence which is kinda funny and cute, he seems so proud of himself. I mean, I would do that to. Having the accomplishment of being the only one to finish a novel especially if that novel turned into reality and you’re about to die but know the novel’s plot."
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Dammit I would go with the sneaky plotter they sound cool
9,"Sep 16, 2020",He's the survivor who killed all those people in his cabin. Do you still want to meet him? 😂😂😂 that was great!
9,"Sep 23, 2020","I love ORV. Anyone who’s experiencing this story for the first time your in for one heck of a ride. I must say a few this things right now: 1. Secretive Plotter is not weak, you’ll see that soon Dokja
2. Uriel best girl
3. In the car next door is someone your always going to have mixed feelings about 
4. All of Dokja’s sponsors are characters that are very important later on
5. Read the novel, it’s so freakin good! It’ll probably take a while because it’s 552 chapters long but it’s so worth it."
9,"Aug 19, 2020","That’s ok, I didnt need my coins anyway 😅"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",* world is literally ending *Boss: Sooo.......see you at work tomorrow?
9,"Aug 19, 2020",I have never gotten hooked om a web toon this fast before.
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Liked the detail of the sponsors chatting on screen. 
9,"Sep 23, 2020","Secretive Plotter might be the one that the Dojka chose because honestly it seems like the perfect one for him, considering he is the reader "
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I'm just worried that the end of the world is gonna happen before the full series is completed and only fast passers are going to be able to survive 😩
9,"Aug 21, 2020","This is a great story! It got me hooked me from the beginning. No regrets spending coins. You dive into this world like everyone else, having to learn the “rules” of the game. What a fun story. Can’t wait to read more! I hope this grows into a mainstream title. Actually, calling it now. You just wait world! "
9,"Aug 20, 2020","Put a finger down if you bought 1 episode with fast pass so you didnt have to wait a week for the next one, but then accidentally bought all the way to episode 8 and now you still have to wait that whole week before you can buy another episode...."
9,"Sep 23, 2020","Currently binging the novel and I gotta say, the hype is unreal."
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Who wants to bet that the Secretive Plotter is actually a really op sponsor
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I'd advise everyone to stay away from comments for this series as much as you can. People tend to give away plot points even without spoiling directly somehow.
9,"Oct 13, 2020",Archangel Uriel here looks all heavenly and imposing and dignified but 200 chapters into the webnovel she's just a fujoshi defending her ship via twitch chat 
9,"Sep 16, 2020",Mori Jin a Sponsor 
9,"Sep 23, 2020",whatever happen i want that little kid survive 
9,"Sep 23, 2020","Anybody else was interested in the story, searched it up online, and just started reading the translated webnovel? (I'm on chapter 366)"
9,"Sep 24, 2020","imagine after finishing this webtoon, the same thing would happen to us..."
9,"Sep 23, 2020","Damn, the true protagonist looks like he's gonna have more edge than a fanfiction"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",seeing just the constellations silhouette makes me drool 🤤 especially Sun Wukong. i only grew up knowing the monkey god due to dbz and some chinese movies 😂 i finally have an image of them whenever i read the novel. i wish i have coins to support author 😗
9,"Sep 24, 2020",Omg sun wukong  I love Chinese mythology
9,"Sep 23, 2020","I wasn't expecting a Journey to the West reference, but knowing about the mischievous Sun Wukong and his influence, it does make sense. I wonder if he'll eventually have a role to play in the story"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",this shit needs to be animated
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Sun Wukong is scary by himself but the description makes him sound so much bigger and mightier and scarier
9,"Sep 23, 2020","I like it how everyone is doubting on dojka about going out but that little boy is not his eyes didn't pop out,it is its proof that he didn't even wince.I want to know more about him,he seems very interesting and important in story.I also wanna say that i think that dojka either chose the one he think is weak or not important or that weak is not weak and dojka gonna soon find out that and maybe he will regret it.But that mysterious personality is sure someone powerful and rare,someone important."
9,"Sep 23, 2020","Wow! What a great chapter. I kind of expected the constellations to be crazy celestial beings, which they kind of are, but that chat of theirs seems to point to a different direction..."
9,"Sep 23, 2020",[SPOILERS IN REPLIES] I'm so hyped for the sunfish 
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Sun Wukong! My boy!
9,"Sep 26, 2020",does anyone else think this would make the perfect anime
9,"Sep 23, 2020","""i'm certain he's not a powerful being, let's move on"" WAITTT "
9,"Sep 23, 2020","Oh yeah, he said earlier that the True Protagonist of the story was the sole survivor of his cabin in the first scenario. I'm starting to think he's not really a 'hero' type of protagonist. 😬"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",They sold me when i saw Son Wukongs figure As a constellation .
9,"Sep 24, 2020","If anyone is confused about demonic judge of fire, the translation should be more like demon-like judge of fire. So it means it’s like a demon not an actual demon."
9,"Sep 24, 2020",1) Dokja may be starting off as a selfish strategic asshole that comes off as selfless to those that are too naive in order to fake being the protagonist but I feel like over time he’ll show that deep down he’s actually selfless powerful protagonist material. And eventually in the end he’ll prove it by dying willingly for the good of the other characters because I’m assuming the actual protagonist has to be alive in the end so in order to let the story end properly he’ll die. This is why I also
9,"Sep 23, 2020","I wanna give credit where credit is due Edgelord is the best attribute name I've seen ever,BUT on serious note the artist utilised Webtoon's vertical panels perfectly, when the sponsor Prisoner of Golden Headband I'm like ""cool another interesting character to see"" then I scroll a bit he says his things but then he say to look at the GOLDEN HEADBAND part I went ""WAIT WAIT, is this my man from Journey to the West,  Sage equal to Heaven, MONKEY KING?!"" I scroll a bit ""YES"""
9,"Sep 23, 2020","imagine our world is being watched by constellations, and we are a super popular channel cos we got corona owo"
9,"Oct 16, 2020","Just wanted to say, if you know anything about Chinese Mythology, you would know, don’t mess with Sun Wukong. "
9,"Sep 26, 2020","i just want to say.....if you people are reading it on other sites, at least come back here to like and support this manhwa. That's the least you can do to show your thanks to author."
9,"Sep 23, 2020",The third sponsor might be the strongest one 
9,"Sep 23, 2020","me: this was kindof a shitty b day... ""Omnicent Reader and 5 other series have updated!"" me: ☺️☺️☺️"
9,"Sep 23, 2020","Everyone just freaks out when Dokja tells them to leave, but the kid remains calm. Im seriously telling you guys theres something wrong with that kid."
9,"Jun 14, 2021",Mori Jin isn't coming back in God of Highschool because he's busy sponsoring people on here
9,"May 9, 2021",I get the feeling Secretive Plotter is going to be a very significant constellation. 
9,"Sep 24, 2020","Never thought I’d see Sun Wukong here, I used to grow up watching the Journey to the West series... the monkey king is an absolute god"
9,"Sep 24, 2020","Damn I starting to love the action genre now, I used  to primarily read romance ones, there need to be more action webtoons in the top 20 because they 𝓭𝓮𝓯𝓲𝓷𝓲𝓽𝓮𝓵𝔂 deserve it "
9,"Sep 23, 2020","Such a clever idea and story to create I would love this to be made into a physical comic. Whatever you do next know that I'll buy everything you create if it is even half as good as this. You have such an amazing talent for telling stories. If you have a patron or anyway that I support you aside of through Webtoon coins let me know, I'd love to support you. Thanks for the amazing story. "
9,"Sep 23, 2020","THE SECRETIVE PLOTTER IS GONNA HAVE SOME MAJOR ROLE LATER, I'M CALLING IT RIGHT NOWWW"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Bro as soon as I saw Golden Headband i knew it was Wukong. I really hope he chose him cause Wukong is badass but knowing how story's go he probably chose someone else
9,"Dec 22, 2020",archangel Uriel and Sun Wukong watching an intergalactic twitch stream. lmaoo nice 
9,"Dec 13, 2020",everyone here discussing theories while I'm simping over dokja
9,"Dec 7, 2020",Who wants to bet that secretive plotter is the most powerful of them all
9,"Sep 25, 2020",Legend says that Mr. Han is still frozen to this day
9,"Sep 23, 2020",so basically dokja's the MC but he's not the protagonist? aight aight
9,"Aug 21, 2020",oh my gosh i need more
9,"Jan 10, 2021","In short, Secretive Plotter is an important constellation? Ok, got it. "
9,"Sep 25, 2020",Oh god ummm... 1. I'm hurt that they changed 'Chuunibyou' to 'Edgelord'. 2. I'm excited to see how they designed [Demonic Judge of Fire]`s Incarnation body. 3. [Secretive Plotter] is NOT someone you all expect it to be. 4. This might seem a bit more serious at the start but it does have some comedic undertones that appear in the later first part of the story. You'll know why I like [Demonic Judge of Fire] so much
9,"Sep 24, 2020",When I reread the name “prisoner of the golden hand band” I was like OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH it’s the Monkey King of Course because at first I was like Golden headband? But then I realized it. I would honestly like the see him pick the 3rd option because it seems like “Secretive Plotter” would be a good choice.
9,"Sep 24, 2020","What if the ""Secretive Plotter"" is the author"
9,"Sep 24, 2020","The monkey king, GOH, Mori... everything is just perfect😌"
9,"Sep 23, 2020","A lot of people talking about how he should of chose the third sponsor, but we never actually see who he chooses- he just seems interested in #4. I don’t think he actually picked it."
9,"Sep 23, 2020","AGH I'm loving this so far! Its kind of trippy how the protag is being portrayed almost like an antagonist so far through the perspective of ""our"" protagonist!"
9,"Sep 24, 2020",The protagonist here got sponsored by Mori Jin. 😉😉
9,"Jul 24, 2021","Solo leveling brought me here and I don't think this is any similar to it but both are incredibly addicting at even only after the first few chapters, I have high hopes for this one"
9,"Oct 7, 2020",AYYEEEEE MORIIII
9,"Oct 1, 2020",Sun Wu Kong (孙悟空) always reminds me of my childhood. I loved the original story (Xi You Ji / 西游记) and it is still one of my favorites :D
9,"Sep 28, 2020",PLEASE CHOSE THE MONKEY KING MY FAVORITE CHARACTER MYTHOLOGY AND MORI JIN
9,"Sep 25, 2020","Pretty sure its “fiery gaze”, cuz supposedly his eyes light up like fire and he can see your true appearance according to how he was described in his own story."
9,"Sep 25, 2020",MONKEY KING!
9,"Sep 24, 2020","Journey to the west was literally my childhood, so having sun wukong in this story honestly makes me really happy"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",if they are picking up korean webtoons i think they shpuld do inso's law. Its art is by the person who made oh holy. Plus its really good.
9,"Sep 19, 2020","pleaseee change ""demonic"" to ""demon-like"" its more fitting and same as the original translates"
9,"Sep 17, 2020",Why are there so many unoriginal comments in this section 🙄 No one cares about how you spent your coins
9,"Aug 28, 2021",I'm feeling that the real protagonist will be 🔥.. I can't wait to see. I also like that lieutenant. I hope he lives long 
9,"May 5, 2021",Who else would have totally chosen Secretive Plotter ✋ 
9,"Apr 30, 2021","I didn't notice at first, but if you zoom into Dokja's face as he's being watched by the Constellations, you can see their messages. ABFD: Why did he kill Namwoon? SP: He shouldn't have spent his coins. 
DJoF: Now that's true justice Lol PotGH: I just knew he would kill the grasshopper. 
It gives a bit of insight into their personalities. This actually wasn't in the original novel. "
9,"Apr 26, 2021",First of all SUN WUKONG HOLY SHIT second if all secretive plotter is going to be such a powerful constellation I just know it
9,"Jan 19, 2021","I bet that unknown constellation was actually the strongest of the ones he got, lol"
9,"Dec 25, 2020","Man anybody reading this now should know this... you're in for a fucking meta ride. A long one, yes but exhilarating too especially the ending"
9,"Oct 9, 2020",Anyone have a feeling that the third sponsor is very imporant? 
9,"Sep 25, 2020",wow mori jin really sponsored this man
9,"Sep 24, 2020","I can't stop myself thinking the amazing imagination skill of the writer here... Thinking of such a storyline, its so unreal, fascinating, scary but surprisingly fresh... every episode is dearly awaited of this webtoon.Kudos to writer!!"
9,"Sep 24, 2020",2) feel like Dokja will end up picking the secretive plotter constellation as his sponsor though he might’ve originally been dismissive of them
9,"Sep 24, 2020",Thanks to God of Highschool (Mori) the moment I saw the headband without even seeing the name I knew it was  the monkey king. 
9,"Sep 23, 2020","THE PRISONER OF THE GOLDEN HEADBAND IS SUN WUKONG, THE MISCHIEVOUS MONKEY KING FROM CHINESE LEGEND!"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Theory: the author who wrote the web novel was so mad because nobody read his work except for Dokja. He creates some magic to kill everyone out of the world.
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Are we not going to talk about the sponsor that Dokja didn't know?? I'm a little bit sus sjdwjsjs is he going to be someone powerful or relevant in the future? 
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Wukong?? MORI??
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Can we just take a moment to thank the author for the art and story lining!!Thank you Author!!
9,"Sep 23, 2020",The art for each of the sponsors is EPIC
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I have a feeling that the third sponsor is someone very powerful and might be the key to their survival or to their fall...I hope Dokja doesn't overlook that (๑•﹏•)
9,"Sep 23, 2020",this is one hell of a novel can't wait to see what the protagonist looks like. .
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Anyone else notice how calm the kid was when dokja said we hafta get outta here?
9,"Sep 23, 2020",i had a feeling that he should've choose the secretive plotter as a sponsor...
9,"Sep 23, 2020",OMG THE MONKEY KING AHHHHHH I LOVE THAT STORY 😱😱😱
9,"Sep 23, 2020",i read the LN but seeing this in manhwa form is just on another level 👌👌👌
9,"Jun 21, 2021","hahahha I'm simping for the protagonist, he's a big cutie, im gonna give him a 1000000000/10"
9,"Apr 26, 2021","""shut up, myeongoh han"" has to be my fave line hahaha really hate those kind on people"
9,"Apr 26, 2021","I mean OBVIOUSLY secret plotter is the correct choice. a mysterious constellation that wasn't mentioned in the original story, whose name basically describes what the main character is doing, who was brushed off as ""probably not a big deal"" or whatever?? yeah no clearly that's the OP choice."
9,"Apr 26, 2021",IM SO INTRIGUED AND ALL THESE BIG NAMES URIEL AND SUN WUKONG SKFJFJJSK I LOVE IT WHEN THESE COMICS COMBINE LORE FROM DIFFERENT CULTURES
9,"Apr 26, 2021","me: ooo.. dragon sounds aweso...  ""but the more you use this constellation's power, the more you lose your senses."" me: o_o nm then... would have a tough time with other 3.. I would probably be more aligned with Uriel (and gosh her pic was so pretty), but the secretive guy sounds interesting (yea the title makes it sound weak, but maybe that's exactly what they want you to think O. O), and Wukong is just cool in theory.."
9,"Apr 26, 2021",ok so i haven't read the webnovel. and actually i came here to make some coins but god.this.is.so.good like i want to read the webnovel now 😫😫
9,"Apr 15, 2021",I feel like that one sponsor who he didn't know is actually the most op one
9,"Feb 10, 2021","Once he says secretive plotter is unimportant, you KNOW he's important. "
9,"Feb 3, 2021",Guys. WE are the sponsors I this.
9,"Jan 28, 2021",I bet the third sponsor is the most powerful out of the four. Usually the subtlest name is the most powerful.
9,"Dec 11, 2020","When Sun Wukong offers to sponsor you, you accept no questions asked."
9,"Oct 17, 2020","I know how wukong could be powerful...but I think the secretive plotter might be better. I know how people believe that this plotter may be the author of TWSA, and honestly that would make sense, but I'd think that this plotter is the asgardian god, Loki. I know some people are probably gonna fight me for this, but I think I got my head straight."
9,"Oct 17, 2020",“This constellation is probably not powerful at all” famous last words 
9,"Oct 17, 2020",Theory time! What if Secretive Plotter is actually the author of TWSA. 🤔
9,"Oct 15, 2020","sun wukong, the Monkey King, is the protagonist of the chinese story Journey to the West — super excited to see him in **this**(edit) webtoon adaption :D "
9,"Oct 14, 2020",I bet to you the Secretive Plotter is op.
9,"Oct 9, 2020",god of highschool +solo leveling
9,"Oct 7, 2020","woahhh dude....if the handsome monkey king makes an offer you should take it. Expand,  yeoui!!!!"
9,"Oct 4, 2020",mori jin is a sponser?
9,"Oct 2, 2020","so what you telling me is that it is between a dragon, archangel, some mysterious lady and a wukong the monkey who is unstoppable hmmmmmmmmm I wonder who he will pick if he didn't pick wukong than wtf wukong is a god if people don't know wukong killed the supreme god "
9,"Oct 1, 2020",amazing how it seems like most of the people here don't know about the original monkey king and speak as if they're referring to mori jin
9,"Sep 25, 2020",man that 4th sponsor is jaechondensong
9,"Sep 25, 2020",monkey king omg mori!!!!! the headband looks so similar plus the staff!!
9,"Sep 25, 2020",I bet the plotter is the most powerful here
9,"Sep 24, 2020",URIEL BEST CONSTELLATION 
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Mori was that you!?
9,"Sep 23, 2020",kim dokja company assemble
9,"Sep 23, 2020",That secretive Plotter seems like a big shot.... And I'm sure he'll come later on 
9,"Sep 23, 2020",y’all better not stop reading this in case it actually happens💀
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Thank you Overly Sarcastic Productions for already teaching me about Sun Wukong
9,"Sep 23, 2020",So excited to see yjh AAA LETS GO OUR PROTAGONIST 
9,"Sep 23, 2020",But...what if I want ALL the sponsors? 🥺
9,"Sep 16, 2020",I'm using all my coins
9,"Sep 2, 2020",Also The other constellations can talk to each other? Well not really a question but just kind of saying when you see all of the constellations put their hands on Dokja’s screen you could see there lil convo😩
9,"Aug 24, 2020","haha, coins go brr "
9,"Aug 20, 2020","This is a new series, and it’s absolutely bangin!!! Dropping coins to power read this, now I’m stuck and waiting xD"
9,"Dec 20, 2021",but why is the guy next door casually hitting door feels so frightening
9,"Aug 21, 2021","welp, im positive the secretive plotter will end up being a very important, possibly powerful character in the coming future considering how he just glanced over them lol."
9,"Jun 25, 2021",this giving me chills down the spine
9,"Jun 13, 2021","OH MY FKN GOD ITS SUN WUKONG, MY CHINESE SENSES ARE TINGLING, MY FAV MONKE SENPAI"
9,"Jun 6, 2021",SUN WUKONG OHMIGOSH MY LITTLE ASIAN HEART IS SO HAPPY TO SEE HIM I LOVE SUN WUKONG MONKEY KING AHHH
9,"May 28, 2021",Lmao Uriel 🤣 Also Dokja don't judge a book by its cover. You should know better than that 
9,"May 28, 2021",MAN this webtoon is so interesting i love the concept it’s so cool
9,"May 19, 2021",*simps over sp’s fingers*
9,"May 19, 2021","OMG I LOVE SUN WUKONG HES MY FAVORITE FROM CHINESE FOLKLORE. I’m honestly so happy he was at least mentioned on this comic, and I hope the MC picked him. "
9,"Apr 29, 2021",I don't know but I can't relate to how calm they are... At least the kid should be traumatized af and be crying rn
9,"Apr 27, 2021",Sun Wukong (Mori Jin) referenced. Please chose him 
9,"Apr 27, 2021",please chose Sun Wukong
9,"Apr 26, 2021","As soon as I saw ""prisoner of the golden band"" I was like :0? Sun Wukong? My boi is here??? PICK HIM PICK THE MONKEY KING (but if we're being real he should definitely pick secret plotter. Also shouldn't they all have discussed who their sponsors are with each other??) "
9,"Apr 6, 2021",Sun Wukong- Omg Wait what--- Prisoner of the Golden Headband-- Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh. (Correct me if I'm wrong) He was pretty strong and uncontrollable. Then a buddhist (I'm not sure if it's called Buddhist in English) used the golden headband to give him bad headaches whenever he's not listening to him. (the buddhist isn't a bad person) 
9,"Mar 23, 2021",THAT was the protagonist of the original novel? What kind of protagonist kills everyone right in the start!? And why do I feel like the secretive plotter is actually important?
9,"Mar 14, 2021","I’m new to this series and it’s fucking great, and my guess is that Secretive Plotter is the author"
9,"Mar 12, 2021",I'm 100% sure the Secretive Plotter gotta be an author who read wrote the novel. I'm guessing it's a story which was written backwards in time so the Plotter could change the true MC character of the novel.
9,"Mar 10, 2021","Ok but when I read “golden headband” and “great sage” my mind just went into overdrive because FOOKEN SUN WUKONG IS IN THIS STORY!!!! THE Sun Wukong! The monkey king! I’m unsure about him being a sponsee because, in his story, sun wukong was a bad guy for a long time and he’s completely fine and even likes killing and eating people. But if he has the golden headband, we should be fine. Sun Wukong is a force to be reckoned with and if he was against us we are sooooo screwed. "
9,"Mar 4, 2021",When you know about Sun Wukong from Overly Sarcastic Productions and are super hyped.
9,"Mar 4, 2021",would you guys believe me if I said I'm reading this inside a train feels so nostalgic 
9,"Feb 28, 2021",Why didn't he considered more about Secretive Plotter?
9,"Feb 18, 2021","all the adults are like ""LeAVe!??!"" and the ma kiddo over there is just like ""cool, sounds like a plan mister"""
9,"Jan 31, 2021",Don't forget to heart and support the webtoon ;)
9,"Jan 28, 2021","""I'm certain that... ...it's not a powerful being"" just watch that 3rd constellation be the most powerful one "
9,"Jan 27, 2021",only one of the four hands looked human
9,"Jan 16, 2021",that golden headband makes me think of you guys all guessed it God of high school let's go Monkey King baby😧😧😧😧😮😮🤨🤨🤔🤔🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😱😱😱😱😱😁😁😁😆😆😆
9,"Jan 8, 2021",hmmm the secretive plotter. i think it holds more meaning behind it
9,"Dec 28, 2020",I like how the live chat is pretty much q standard Twitch/YouTube chat.
9,"Dec 10, 2020","Jin Mori, what are you doing here?"

9,"Oct 14, 2020",Hmmmm secretive plotter sounds kinda sus-.- haha get it
9,"Oct 12, 2020",why I saw Jin mori there I mean great sage heaven's equal ＼(°o°)／
9,"Oct 8, 2020",So he's saying the protagonist of the novel he enjoyed reading so much is a ruthless and brutal killer? No wonder he doesn't want to meet him.
9,"Oct 8, 2020",I like how the kid is holding his hand like dokja is his dad 😂
9,"Oct 8, 2020",Yoooo the fact that Sun Wukong is in this story as a sponsor makes my inner child so happy! The Journey to the West was my childhood 
9,"Oct 7, 2020",I would've choose secretive plotter... Instinct told me HAHA
9,"Oct 7, 2020",mori jin!
9,"Sep 28, 2020",damn ill choose monkey king
9,"Sep 27, 2020","damn, so Mori jin is going to be his sponsor huh. What an absolute chad!"
9,"Sep 27, 2020","Guys, even if you read somewhere else, try to support the series here with your views and heart reacts. If it gets popular here, it may get an anime. "
9,"Sep 26, 2020","<Spoiler up ahead> It's funny now that i think back about it, aside from our sunfish protagonist, insect boi is the last one in KDJC to reveal his sponsor, which, is quite a shock hohoho."
9,"Sep 26, 2020",This 👏needs 👏more 👏views👏 it’s such a good story oh my goddddddndndnsnsj
9,"Sep 25, 2020",I've been bamboozled!!! You can't name the episode The Protagonist and then not show him!!! ;-;
9,"Sep 25, 2020",Dang it I wish this webtoon could have told us the future of 2020
9,"Sep 24, 2020",just wanna say that the serie is amaazing and so is the artwork 
9,"Sep 24, 2020","ok here’s a theory don’t judge me haha, but what if he got into an accident on the train and is in a coma dreaming of all of this and once the game is over then he’ll be able to wake up... just me? ok"
9,"Sep 24, 2020",ARCH ANGEL URIEL LOL I REMEMBER HER IN THE NOVEL SHES HILARIOUS
9,"Sep 24, 2020",Everyone is like 👀 while the kids is like😶
9,"Sep 24, 2020","as a web novel reader, i feel sooo weird while finally getting to see pictures😭"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",SUN WUKONG I'll literally read anything if you tell me there's Sun Wukong in it and the art is truly amazing. That shadow of Sun Wukong is literally the most realistic I've seen in all web novels
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I like secretive plotter and how MC reacted to it like 👁👄👁and skips 
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Why do I have a feeling that he should've choosen the 3rd sponser??? Dokja better not regret it later on.... (ꏿ﹏ꏿ;).     (;ŏ﹏ŏ)
9,"Sep 23, 2020",The Art Is amazing ...Loook at that Archangel Urial . the Sowrd and the balancer ... Awesome
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Ayeeeeee a journey to the west reference! 
9,"Sep 23, 2020",First Panel that boy clinging to dokja is so cute
9,"Sep 23, 2020","I just hope that the ""real"" protagonist of TWSA is as handsome as I imagined while reading the novel 😔✊"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I saw Wukong and thought of Jin Mori
9,"Sep 23, 2020",i loveee this omg i want more aso i hope he chooses Monkey king 
9,"Sep 23, 2020","the kid be like "" ok dokja dad""without any reaction."
9,"Sep 23, 2020",the protagonist becomes the antagonist
9,"Sep 23, 2020","This is a weird paradox. The MC doesn't want to meet the protagonist while we're reading a story where we don't know if we'd want to meet the MC. While he's most likely a better person than the protagonist, he's still very cold about human life. Makes for an interesting MC but a questionable ""friend""."
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I love when stories mention Wukong
9,"Sep 23, 2020",[A constellation is restraining themselves from saying spoilers]
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Yeahhh they got wukong in this story
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Song WuKong!!! Wow brings back old memories! I didn't think a Chinese legend would be featured in a Korean tale...
9,"Sep 23, 2020", jin mori got bored so he became a sponsor lmao
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I'm a huge fan of the light novel and I'm really excited to see this as a WebToon! thanks to the author and artists for making this come true 🙏🏻
9,"Feb 7, 2022",damn I should've read this in 2020 and now it's alr 2022 😓
9,"Feb 6, 2022",interesting to see chinese legends in this
9,"Oct 13, 2021",No one gonna talk about the ender dragon?
9,"Sep 22, 2021",HE SHOULD JUST KILL THE PROTAGONIST SO HE CAN BE THE ONE. JK
9,"Sep 21, 2021","yall I swear I could hear the ""recalculating"" after dokja said ""do you still want to meet him?"" LOL"

9,"Sep 14, 2021","The moment I started this chapter I had a thought, what if, I'm just saying but, what if just like when we finish reading this Webtoon, just like how Dokja finished reading TWSA our world will turn just like theirs? I know magic doesn't exist but just imagine, just like them they didn't think even once if magic was real. So, what if, when we finish reading this Webtoon our world will turn into just like theirs"
9,"Aug 15, 2021",Yo I read “Prisoner of the Golden Headband” and I was like “No freaking way” and the the REVEAL holy CRAP I’m shook.
9,"Aug 12, 2021",the way they changed their mind 🤣🤣🤣
9,"Jul 22, 2021",anybody else think he should've picked the one that he didnt know about seems like it's always the mysterious things like that that help you the most in these situations
9,"Jun 13, 2021",So the reason why Mori Jin is not yet back in TGOH is because he's still busy watching the live and offering sponsorship 😂😂
9,"Jun 7, 2021",finnalllly!!!...so there's really a comic in which the MC scolds shithead like Mr han....how fuckinnn satisfying!!...i can die in peace now 🤣
9,"May 30, 2021",oh my god its ALWAYS sun wukomg istg
9,"May 27, 2021",And tell me HOW the kid is so calm like mc which i don't remember the name of
9,"May 27, 2021",Did i just saw the ender dragon? 
9,"May 1, 2021",Anyone else able to guess the fourth constellation was Sun Wukong because of Overly Sarcastic Production's animation of Journey to the West?
9,"Apr 28, 2021",WHY HAVEN'T I READ THIS SOONER. IT'S AMAZING 👁️👄👁️
9,"Apr 28, 2021",I kind of want to read the actual story he's talking about
9,"Apr 27, 2021",secretive plotter is giving me a certain vibe
9,"Apr 27, 2021","Lets just take a look at that cute little boy 🥺, he grew in me, I hope he's not one  of the few casualties the author has to take down for the plot to continue, I know he's a kid but I hope he'll walk side by side with our protagonist 😔... Edit : I realized if we are really sponsoring some1, I'll be the idiot who'll spend all her money on a kid cause he's cute🤣🤣, now I know why he wanted him in the team LOL"
9,"Apr 27, 2021",Yesssss Sun Wukong is in this story yeaaa!!
9,"Nov 27, 2020","I JUST FINISHED READING GOD OF HIGHSCHOOL AND WATCHING HWAYUGI WHICH HAVE THE SAME THEME OF GREAT SAGE, EQUAL TO HEAVEN SUN WUKONG LMFAO"
9,"Nov 11, 2020",So this is what's Jin Mori doing in his spare time
9,"Nov 7, 2020","Feeling like Secretive Plotter is broken but nothing wrong with making a safe, powerful choice like Wukong either.   "
9,"Oct 17, 2020",GOD OF HIGH SCHOOL ANYONE?!? MORI?!? THE MONKEY KING?!?
9,"Oct 17, 2020",SUN WUKONG! I absolutely adore the beautiful constellation designs!
9,"Oct 16, 2020",I hope he chose the monkey king.... btw I already love this! the author knows how to make a great story.
9,"Oct 16, 2020",OMG SUN WUKONG BAHAHHA
9,"Oct 15, 2020","Sun Wukong would be an Excellent choice, Uriel not a bad one either but too restrictive.
out of the four I kinda hope he chose monkey king "
9,"Oct 14, 2020",its great because I get all the foreshadowing 
9,"Oct 12, 2020",SUPREME GOD JAECHEONDAESEONG MORI JINNNN!!!!!!!
9,"Oct 8, 2020","I would have chosen the one that he has never seen before, it’s risky I know"
9,"Oct 7, 2020",Me: *sees the fourth choice* you dont pick it and I will end you. You didnt need to show me anything I know who that was even from the name of I was him I would pick it without hesitation 
9,"Oct 7, 2020","when it mentioned the monkey king ( the great sage , equal of heaven)me: omg korean odyssey (hwayugi)"
9,"Oct 3, 2020",See's : Golden HeadbandMe: OMG WHY IS WUKONG AND LU BU IN EVERY ISEKAI MANWHA
9,"Oct 1, 2020",I think He's the REAL Protagonist in the story. 
9,"Oct 1, 2020","""We need to get out of here."" Everyone else: Are you stupid? Dumb even LOOK OUSIDE"
9,"Sep 27, 2020","A Journey to the west reference, the monkey king"
9,"Sep 27, 2020","this is the best weebtoon on this app i can say for sure I hope this webtoon goes on for 3,000 episodes I will read them all even if I had to pay for them. 
P.S. Also to the author i really like this and I meant it when I said it is the best webtoon on here and by the end of it I hope u can make it in to a anime/series for everyone that really likes it to watch and i can't wait for the next episode u can be sure that i will be the first one to read it 😁"
9,"Sep 27, 2020",THERE ARE AROUND 540 CHAPTERS IN THE NOVEL. IF EVERY EP COVERS ONE CHAPTER EVERY WEEK THIS WILL TAKE 10 YEARS TO FINISH
9,"Sep 27, 2020",Addictive and amazing. The writing and art both lend themselves in creating the atmosphere of desperation and urgency that comes with a cataclysmic event. Even with the Reader being present you still get the sense that nothing is a sure thing.
9,"Sep 27, 2020",I just realized this is similar to the Hunger Games—except it’s not 24 Tributes and super rich sponsors...it’s the whole world and the constellations—
9,"Sep 26, 2020","As soon as I saw ""prisoner of the golden headband"" I knew it had to be the monkey king, Sun Wukong!! And that furry hand confirmed it for me!!! I wasn't expecting Uriel to be one of the sponsors, though. We still don't know the other two's names yet, but they're probably more characters from various mythologies and religions!"
9,"Sep 26, 2020","No, I can't wait that long! And I don't have coins : ("
9,"Sep 25, 2020",I’m so on edge. This story is amazing 
9,"Sep 25, 2020","Them: What should we doHim: We have to get outside
Outside: ROAR"
9,"Sep 25, 2020",Hmm Sun Wu Kong sounds like Mori from GOH also sounds like something he would do. Hmm
9,"Sep 24, 2020","Every time I see Dokja’s name, I see Doja Cat and start singing “Say So”. lol "
9,"Sep 24, 2020",The authors Version of the Handsome Monkey King Sun Wukong looks absolutely terrifying and awesome. Just as it should be.
9,"Sep 24, 2020",THE SUNFISH BASTARD MAKES HIS ENTRANCEEEE
9,"Sep 24, 2020",I am ready to fangirl with Uriel all over again-
9,"Sep 24, 2020",Jin Mori has sponsored Dojka 
9,"Sep 24, 2020",I bet Secretive Plotter is actually the most powerful
9,"Sep 24, 2020","Well you did form a party with the kid to protect him, no wonder an angel wanted to be your sponsor. Also that kid is the only one like ""Okay whatever"" when he said they should leave the train lol."
9,"Sep 24, 2020",umm... this new guy doesnt seem very... protagonisty.
9,"Sep 24, 2020",Watch when the manga ends WW3 happens and the apocalypse starts
9,"Sep 24, 2020",I LOVE THIS IS COMPLETELY AMAZINGG
9,"Sep 24, 2020",bet it's the author 
9,"Sep 24, 2020",URIEL!!! THE PRESIDENT OF OUR FANSCLUB!!!
9,"Sep 24, 2020",lol I thought Dokja would replace the protagonist. guess not...(ー_ー゛)
9,"Sep 23, 2020",MOOOOOOOOOOONKEY
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I'm a little sad that Webtoons translated Uriel's title as Demonic instead of Demon-like like in the English translation of the web novel since I see Demonic meaning associated with demons instead of like a demon. Probably just me being nitpicky. 
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I bet that 3rd sponsor is going to be important
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I know that I will never get enough of this! The series is just too great that the plot always has me on edge! Thank you Shingshong!
9,"Sep 23, 2020","Rereading earlier episodes like this one just to see the art for ‘The handsome monkey king, great sage, heaven’s equal SunWuKong’ again🤩🤩"
9,"Sep 23, 2020","I have a question is there anyway we can buy this comic like a book, I mean Is there a real life finished comic? It's really amazing and I don't think I can wait 😂"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",ayoo why did mori jin debut here
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Pretty sure the secretive plotter would have been a good choice...
9,"Sep 23, 2020","ngl, I hoped he kinda picked secretive plotter cos that kinda shady figure feels right for an ominous reader."
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I LOVE THE WHOLE PLOT OF THIS COMIC!! IT NEEDS TO BECOME AN ANIME/MOVIE OR SOMETHING ASAP!
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I think ignoring Secretive Plotter might be a bad move in the long run....
9,"Sep 23, 2020",i got major “iTS MR. LEORIO” vibes from that one guy with the glasses LMAO 😭
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I’m really glad a Chinese character has been depicted as accurate as it can get in this webtoon! Thank you creator!
9,"Sep 23, 2020",So Mori Jin sneaked his way in this webcomic🌚
9,"Sep 23, 2020","Oh my god !! I want to see the true protagonist of this story !! 😮😮 but why this cliffhanger 😭😭Anyways , I would like to thank author for publishing omniscient reader here, thank you for your hard work, we will wait patiently for the next episode, love you author ❤️💗"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",The studio is making even the normal stuff such as leaving the room look cool with the artwork. 100/10 for the art
9,"Sep 23, 2020",.........HE GOT THE EDGELORD SPONSOR🤣
9,"Sep 23, 2020","Kinda ironic how each episode gets fewer and fewer likes. The prologue has over 99,999 now it's more around the 50,000 mark. Just like in TWSA"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I only knew 2 references Sun Wu Kong and Archangel Uriel. This is very interesting!!!
9,"Sep 23, 2020",what kind of protagonist kills all people to suvive..
9,"Sep 23, 2020","damn, they even got sun wukong"
9,"Sep 23, 2020","this is so messed up, like, for us he's the protagonist, but for him, the other guy is, i love it"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Secretive Plotter is definitely gonna be op
9,"Sep 23, 2020",i love characters who is initially stuck up and selfish so im hoping for character development for mr han im rooting for him. 
9,"Sep 23, 2020",son wukong?why is this taking me to God of high school
9,"Sep 23, 2020","I just started reading the book version, I swear this has hooked too much"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Secretive Plotter’s identity is one of the biggest plot twists in the novel. I can’t see him the same way after knowing who he is
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Did anyone else see the sponsors talking like it was WEBTOON comments?? No? Just me? Ok...
9,"Sep 23, 2020",don't tell me that DOKJA isn't the protagonist 🙄🙄🙄🙄
9,"Sep 23, 2020","Seriously, this is probably my favorite series and since he knows everything he seems so smart and badass to everyone else"
9,"Sep 23, 2020","Translation for demonic works better as demon-like. Hence, demon-like means it's not a demon, but rather an angel."
9,"Sep 23, 2020","I'm sure he got a better plan than joining the ""protagonist"" but I'd have just been so openly meta in his scenario. ""Behold, the hero of our story."""
9,"Sep 23, 2020","Okay is it just me or is the “secretive plotter” was it? Like the most powerful sponsor, I’m not the only one thinking that right?"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",prisoner of the golden headband..... Goku?
9,"Sep 23, 2020","Is it just me, or does the “protagonist” actually seem like a bad guy? "
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Uriel is best girl you can fucking fight me
9,"Aug 25, 2020",The author bathing in coins rn.
9,"Aug 19, 2020",i need... MORE.
9,"Sep 28, 2020","guys even if you have already read ahead, don't encourage others to go to another website since HERE is the only place where you can actually show support to the author,,,, also chill with the spoilers geez"
9,"Jun 16, 2022","He really should have taken the plotter. A character, with a cool ass name, that didnt appear in the book? Sign me the fucc up"
9,"Mar 25, 2022",Ik I’m late as hell. BUT THE MOMENT I SAW THE MONKEY PAW I KNEW ITS WAS WUKONG. IF I WAS HIM ID CHOOSE WUKONG IMMEDIATELY. I LOVE HIIIIM. Favorite myth of all time
9,"Mar 10, 2022",Sun Wu Kong is actually from a Chinese story(?)!! This Webten including the art and story line is amazing! I'm very excited what's going to happen next.
9,"Mar 2, 2022",this is so good I can't believe I held off reading it for so long
9,"Feb 13, 2022","Lmao if only secretive plotter knew how Dokja imagined them in his head XDDDThe sponsor part was such beautiful parallel to THAT.
But really he was lucky he didn't get a head smack XDDD"
9,"Jan 3, 2022",I would've went with the secrets sponsor. seems like she might know something about his situation
9,"Dec 20, 2021",🗿why am I getting feeling that secretive plotter is gonna be the hidden king
9,"Dec 11, 2021","Technically were the constilations, right?? "
9,"Dec 8, 2021","The more a read this, The more I get addicted to it"
9,"Dec 6, 2021","I suddenly remember the movie ""Journey to the west."" And the korean series ""A korean odessy."" Because of the great sage heavens equel sun wukong "
9,"Nov 8, 2021","Damn,Sun Wukong decided to sponsor? That seems kinda op to me"
9,"Oct 27, 2021","not me actually thinking that the sponsor abyssal black dragon's name was ""quite long"" for a moment there 😭"
9,"Oct 4, 2021",Why am I here at 5 in the morning reading two genres that have never been to my liking? death games and something like isekai 
9,"Sep 8, 2021",I bet those people who first started reading the story and then quit are really regretting their decision rn 😂 
9,"Sep 3, 2021",I feel like Secretive Plotter was a big catch>.>
9,"Aug 30, 2021",I LOVE THIS
9,"Aug 25, 2021","My brain literally said ""Oh lawd he coming"" when they said the protagonist was tryna bust through the door 😭"
9,"Aug 12, 2021",out of the 8 doors the only that works is the one the protagonist is trying to break through 😂
9,"Aug 7, 2021",I hope he picked SunWukong
9,"Jun 29, 2021",Didn't know that they will include a character from Journey to the West. Interesting. 
9,"Jun 26, 2021",okay but he's so handsome
9,"Jun 26, 2021",when he takes forever to choose his sponsor... me: OMG THERES NOT ENOUGH TIME BRUH JUST CHOOSE THE FANCIEST NAMED ONE SLD:FKJSDLFKJLKFJDSLKFJ AAAAAAAAAAAA XD
9,"May 22, 2021","Everything is pretty alright, until we are the ones next."
9,"May 19, 2021","I was rereading the series, and I'm wondering if the secret plotter is also the author to the survival guide."
9,"May 12, 2021",Wow. This is like we're the constellations spending coins for them
9,"May 4, 2021",Damn so the protagonist is a mass murder already
9,"Apr 29, 2021",Ironic since Wukong is a trickster in mythology and he's been a trickster since he meddled with the story
9,"Apr 29, 2021",Ok but the art of the sponsors was so gorgeous you could feel the power behind them
9,"Apr 29, 2021",Is this going to become an anime. I hope so 
9,"Apr 29, 2021","When I read ""Prisoner"" and saw the monkey hand I just knew it was the Monkey King."
9,"Apr 28, 2021",these constellation names sound like how me and my friends used to make usernames/group names to sound 'edgy' 😂😂
9,"Apr 27, 2021",monkey king
9,"Apr 27, 2021",the art for the secret plotter is really neat :v
9,"Apr 26, 2021",Han’s face the whole time after he was told to shut up had me laughing so hard😂and I know that Dokja is just a character but dang he’s fine🥵
9,"Apr 26, 2021","u don't need to spend coins, u just need to read this series 1 yr later🙊chill buddies! I'm a late reader that's why😔"
9,"Apr 26, 2021",mr han omg I'm cracking up he doesn't even get to be in color anymore 😂
9,"Apr 26, 2021",Dokja  really hit pause on Mr. Han lol
9,"Apr 25, 2021","I just spoiled myself who secretive plotter was, and I'm in great shock. I never expected that, mind-blowing plot twist. This story is freaking amazing I'm crying 😭😭 "
9,"Apr 17, 2021",Golden headband? monkey king? Mori Jin? oops wrong webtoon😆 
9,"Apr 7, 2021",Sun Wukong as a sponser? or was it the secret keeper? either one sounds interesting
9,"Apr 4, 2021",I bet that the Secretive plotter is the writer.
9,"Apr 3, 2021",So Mori became his charyeok
9,"Apr 2, 2021",bro when I say monkey kind and then wukong I screamed.. lately I've been binging the weebtoons the god of highschool so you get the point🤯😆
9,"Mar 16, 2021",Having read the webnovel enough to see who Secretive Plotter is makes it really funny that Dokja disregards him as weak
9,"Mar 5, 2021",Secretive plotter thou.
9,"Mar 4, 2021",I thought I could get away  from him but he's followed me from The God Of High School.
9,"Feb 21, 2021",Mr Hans face tho LMAO😂
9,"Feb 21, 2021","The person behind that door may be the main character of Three ways to survive the apocalypse, but Dokja here is the main character of THIS story, so everything is going to be okay."
9,"Feb 19, 2021",remember to comment and like every episode so that the artist will help you survive the apocalypse. Thank you for this episode! I look forward to finishing the series
9,"Feb 16, 2021",i'd choose secretive plotter just because
9,"Jan 30, 2021",umhhh yes that's an orphan over there
9,"Jan 26, 2021","That archangel is named after me lmao,my name is actually uriel"
9,"Jan 17, 2021",I just remembered Korean odyssey...the great sage ..omg
9,"Jan 1, 2021",This story I'm definitely re-reading after I finish an arc or catch up.
9,"Dec 25, 2020","it's interesting that he's putting himself lower than the protagonist, usually being in an omniscient P.O.V are considered god of the story, since they know the actions and outcomes of the story"
9,"Dec 24, 2020",if you read god of high school then you will know who sun wukong is. 
9,"Dec 2, 2020","Novel reader here: the modifier should be ""Demon-like"" instead of ""Demonic"" for Uriel - just sayin' it feels more accurate. :/"
9,"Nov 30, 2020",have a feeling secret plotter is the one that wrote the novel and sent him the email
9,"Nov 11, 2020",Why does the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon remind me of the ender dragon from minecraft.. ;w;    Edit:I don't know about you guys but I don't have to spend any coins for these mangas.Maybe because I'm reading from a laptop.
9,"Nov 9, 2020","what if Secretive ploter is the writer?, and why he doesn't want to meet the mc?"
9,"Nov 7, 2020","Damn, so MC got Mori Jin's attention as a sponsor. Not bad, MC; not bad. I'm just waiting for you to yell 2 things - 1. Yeoui 2. Geundowoon. Pardon me for the spelling mistakes if I made any. I'm out."
9,"Nov 2, 2020","i love how everyone looks shocked when dokja says ""we have to escape"" but he kid gives zero fucks"

9,"Oct 17, 2020","I feel so bad for the young boy , he had to see all that while still in a really young age . I don't know how he could handle all this though"

9,"Oct 15, 2020","I MEAN IT’S JUST ME THAT I SAW THE MONKEY KING FROM GOD OF HIGHSCHOOL, JAECHEONDAESONG? Just asking"
9,"Oct 15, 2020","I'm new here and I don't know if he is the protagonist, but I'm pretty sure he is, so it's so sad to see that the world he used to live in, made him get big trust issues that resulted in him not believing that he is enought to be the 💫 the main character 💫(Sorry if I said something wrong, english is not my first language)"
9,"Oct 14, 2020",this webtoon gives coins just to make you want to spend them on this comic😐 aight....nice marketing you meanies
9,"Oct 14, 2020",anyone else started reading the novel cuz they couldn’t wait to see what happens?
9,"Oct 7, 2020",warning warning crossover frmo god of highschool Monkey king or more ji
9,"Oct 7, 2020",Is it bad that I want to see the main character? I really wanted Dokja to be the main character but that's fine he's still cool.
9,"Oct 3, 2020",incarnation?? does that mean they see themselves throw you?? ooor  that you sold your body for them to use??
9,"Oct 1, 2020",Lee Hyeonseong is what i imagined of him to look like. A giant babie
9,"Oct 1, 2020",*sees black flame dragon* e-ender dragon is that u?
9,"Sep 30, 2020","I'm so glad I'm reading this! The art is beautiful and it's so cool and amazing! I have to admit, I was confused at first but when I kept reading it made more sense and I would highly recommend this webtoon to people!"
9,"Sep 30, 2020",what is really sad is that i bought this episode last week and now i have to wait a WHOLE other week just for the next episode
9,"Sep 30, 2020",Sooooo handsomeeeee offfff asdfdsghscngschcs
9,"Sep 29, 2020",Angel Uriel literally commented 'lol' in that one panel😶
9,"Sep 28, 2020",love the plot i hope this turns into a long term serious
9,"Sep 28, 2020",Kim Dokja the most handsome squid. No one can change my mind. 
9,"Sep 28, 2020","I hope after you read in some sites, still you read here at webtoon. because at least we support the author here. just saying lol"
9,"Sep 28, 2020",Choose secretive planner its probably something really strong just descised as something weak. 
9,"Sep 27, 2020","If you still think this is like solo leveling, it's not, its so much better than every story out there, the webnovel finished awhile ago and you can find it at boxnovel.com, keep reading it and you will understand what I meant theres nothing that can replace this story in your heart<3 THIS IS NOT AN ISEKAI OP HAREM STORYLINE WITH PLOT ARMOR! "
9,"Sep 27, 2020",So theory/ confusion. Dokja is an irregularity. Not just because he has knowledge on TWSA due to being the only reader but I think his entire existence is an irregularity. Joonghyuk expresses that he doesn’t recognize dokja and that things are different compared to the other 2? 3? times he regressed/relived. That tells us that dokja wasn’t there the other times or he didn’t survive. But why wouldn’t he have survived? (Continued in comments)
9,"Sep 27, 2020",sooo is TWSA's main protagonist going to look exactly like Dokja or what? that would be super cool! 
9,"Sep 27, 2020",Have you heard of a window?
9,"Sep 26, 2020","Guys, LN reader here. Just gonna say that future episodes will have more twists. Each arc gets better than the previous in terms of plot twists. If you like characters like Khun, Lelouch, L, Light Yagami..then prepare yourselves to witness a character like that or even smarter than them. It's like Khun or Lelouch on steroids. Smartest MC ever. "
9,"Sep 26, 2020","Bihyung, my hero... "
9,"Sep 26, 2020",This gives me some Sword Art Online vibes and im loving it!! 😍
9,"Sep 26, 2020",Now watch as after we finish reading this. The world ends and this becomes reality.
9,"Sep 25, 2020",is it just me or am i not really interested in seeing the 'true protagonist'. dokja's already stolen my attention 🕶
9,"Sep 25, 2020",If that kid dies... I WILL CRY!
9,"Sep 25, 2020",after “..its not a powerful being” the blue screen was annoyed XD
9,"Sep 25, 2020",Read my username... do you support? (this is probably for those who have read the novel)
9,"Sep 25, 2020",damnnnnn this is epic
9,"Sep 25, 2020",Shut up MYEONGOH HAN 🤣🤣🤣
9,"Sep 24, 2020",Mori? hahaha wtf. 
9,"Sep 24, 2020",Does this mean we the readers are the constellations and those who use coins are sponsors? And webtoon is the dokkaebi? Just sayin' 
9,"Sep 24, 2020","Them making a visual point of this makes my heart flutter, the details omg i can’t even. This is so goooood."
9,"Sep 24, 2020","Gilyeong Lee is so adorable and I like him not being fazed by what is hapoening and sricking to Dokja Kim like glue. If he survives, I wanna take him home and give him hugs"
9,"Sep 24, 2020",wait why is he scared of the protagonist? aren't they supposed to be good?
9,"Sep 24, 2020",is that the ender dragon 
9,"Sep 24, 2020","id probably be like ""hahaha i can pick the dragon dragons are strong!!!"""
9,"Sep 24, 2020",the manager being white pale for so many panels had me cracking
9,"Sep 24, 2020",o no
9,"Sep 24, 2020",I LOVE THIS COMIC 😍❤️
9,"Sep 24, 2020","Did Dokja not pick a sponsor yet? Is that why the Dokkaebi said there will be more chances later to get a sponsor? That’s smart on Dokja’s part then, he wants to see what his other options will be when more constellations see his potential and want to sponsor him and that way he might be able to deduce which constellation is who exactly"
9,"Sep 24, 2020",am I the only one who thought of god of highschool when I saw the monkey king constellation?
9,"Sep 24, 2020",He easily dismissed the secretive plotter but I feel like the secretive plotter holds a lot of power (maybe even more than the others constellations) 
9,"Sep 24, 2020","MY THEORY: The ""Secretive Plotter"" IS THE AUTHOR OF TWSA and he/she knew all of this was going to happen and wrote the stories so that way the people he/she sponsors have an advantage!"
9,"Sep 24, 2020",me reading comments posted on August 19th today..Damn!
9,"Sep 24, 2020",Am I the only one who had already read it but is now re reading it and punching the like button in order to increase the popularity of this master piece

9,"Sep 23, 2020",Can't wait to see the MC of the story become John Snow
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Dokja is so op. And he’s so sweet for protecting that little boy. The little boy will certainly become someone great in this Webtoon series.
9,"Sep 23, 2020",new favorite!
9,"Sep 23, 2020",why do I feel like he should have choose the secertive plotter or whatever was it's name?

9,"Sep 23, 2020",I love this comic sooo much!!!! It’s that thing that allows me to escape reality for a few minutes.
9,"Sep 23, 2020","this is so good, please give me the complete book, its manga comic, the anime, the netflix adaptation right now!"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",When you realise you're an omniscient reader because you read the novel for omniscient reader and is now reading the manhwa for omniscient reader.
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I love that little boy so much

9,"Sep 23, 2020",Anime! Anime! Anime! Anime! Anime! ANIME!!!!! This would make a good anime lol
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I feel like the secret plotter is going to be an important person later. Maybe the same author who gave him the Omniscient Reader ability?
9,"Sep 23, 2020",If I was to choose a sponsor I’d want Secretive Plotter. I’m getting some gut instinct they are a smart choice
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Secretive Plotter tho
9,"Sep 23, 2020",monkey King - Mori Jin😂
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Hear me out what if we’re reading this now and soon the number of readers will decrease till theirs only 1 of us left and then this happens to our galaxy and we all end up dying except for one of us

9,"Nov 18, 2020",wukong is op if anyone plays Warframe they will understand I would choose him definitely 
9,"Nov 18, 2020",So this what mori Jin was doing on his road to India ... he was sponsoring 🤣🤣 bless him
9,"Nov 16, 2020","The secret guy who sponsors, i think he's strong its always the guy who is secretive but actually sO~oO strong"
9,"Nov 16, 2020",bruh the little boy was like OK when he said let's leave he didn't even have a reaction

9,"Oct 28, 2020",Demon-like Judge of Fire was the actual name in the novel 
9,"Oct 26, 2020",i think dokja choose MONKEY KING and lets guess if THE MONKEY KING is mori jin of G.O.H (well he is in G.O.H) especially in this webtoon who is powerful and martial art experts...................just guess
9,"Oct 24, 2020",I’m guessing the Secretive Plotter will become important later if Dokja is brushing it aside... 🧐🤔
9,"Oct 24, 2020","Those are some crazy titles that honestly make me thing of like Eldritch gods and stuff. Prisoner and Plotter probably fit him best however. No way. Sun Wukong took an interest in him? The legendary Monkey King? Looks like he’ll be teaming up with them for now. My bet is that the initial survivors grouped together based on proximity at first. What world is Mr. Hwah living in though? If he’s the protagonist, why is Kim so scared? Lol instant switch"
9,"Oct 21, 2020",Wow so that is the protagonist uhh.....so there are 2 protagonists?
9,"Oct 21, 2020",I actually like how Myeongah Han develops later on. 
9,"Oct 21, 2020",this is like dice and home sweet home put together

9,"Oct 15, 2020",lol the constellations are also giving coins 😂 (for the episode)
9,"Oct 14, 2020","I still think he should have picked that Secretive plotter or whatever his name is as a sponsor,because it seems like his name matches with all the things Dokja know and hides from everyone"
9,"Oct 14, 2020",hoky shif the Ender Dragon of Minecraft wants to sponser him?! 
9,"Oct 14, 2020",BREAK THE GLASS BREAK THE GLASS BREAK THE FCKING GLASS

9,"Oct 1, 2020",i feel like secretive plotter was a better option for the future. Maybe im getting ahead of the story but it looked like a mental/social manipulation skill. If he cant fight the protagonist perhaps he can become his friend trought lie to survive for now ? i cant fet enought of that webtoon
9,"Sep 30, 2020","Wow :o those sponsor drawings were really nice, especially the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon owo"

9,"Sep 24, 2020",I feel like this is gonna happen with the readers. We all gonna finish and then BOOM twsa happens. so let's all pay attention
9,"Sep 24, 2020","80 percent of these comments are people talking about how good the story is, spoilers, and how happy they are about spending coins. I just wanna hear theories from new readers. I get that the story might be cool, but I want to see someone actually talking about what they think is going on."
9,"Sep 24, 2020","Mr. Han is exactly like Leorio.

9,"Sep 24, 2020","So Dokja wants to be the protagonist so bad he wants to defeat the protagonist of TWSA? But I realized we never got to see the ending for TWSA, sure Dokja read it but he never said how it ended out loud "

9,"Sep 24, 2020",does anyone have recommendations for good webnovels/apps for reading them?
9,"Sep 24, 2020",I wonder if people hope this webtoon becomes reality ten years from now?
9,"Sep 24, 2020",Couldn't wait to see how The Protagonist actually looks like.
9,"Sep 24, 2020",This series has me absolutely hooked! I've read the LN and they've adapted it so well!
9,"Sep 23, 2020","I stumbled across this Webtoon only because I recognized the Art Style. I Love how Mint and detailed this Studio is! The only similarity I see is the Game style Interfaces. In any Case, Love em both"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",At this point I would've already killed myself bc I'd rather die by my own choice
9,"Sep 23, 2020",True protagonist he like: I am gonna get that story back boy Cmere cmere
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Hehe.. I think he’s gonna regret not picking the secretive plotter 
9,"Sep 23, 2020",uh oh .......he did not pay much attention to the thrid sponsor that means........he will be in big trouble
9,"Sep 23, 2020",the 'abbysal black flame dragon' strongly gives me ender dragon vibes

9,"Sep 23, 2020",Why do I feel like the protagonist is gonna look like him like a doppelgänger or something???
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I've never wanted to fast pass so bad before.
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Dokja: “It’s not a powerful being” Me: “Pfft- HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA”
9,"Sep 23, 2020","does anyone interested in other people's sponsors or constellations and their powers? .
Hey fans, LIKE this, if you also AGREE with me that dojka should help others (sanga, small boy, etc) in choosing the constellations or sponsors??

please dojka help others in surviving."
9,"Sep 23, 2020",The faces they made when dokja said we have to get out of here 😂 😭 
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Lmao Kdj probably think that Secretive Plotter looks like a homeless guy wwww

9,"Sep 23, 2020",Best Novel Ever!!!!
9,"Sep 23, 2020",I need a coins sponser ;-;

9,"Sep 23, 2020",They changed it from demon like to demonic but I think demon like makes more sense for his explanation of NOT being a demon....
9,"Sep 23, 2020","It is Wednesday 9/23/2020 1:55amDear Author.... i never wanted to spend money to get coins, and I'm a picky reader so i never partake in the free coin events.... but Damnit you got me. I'm buying coins, because i have to know what happens next.

9,"Sep 23, 2020","if I was a sponsor my coins go to the little boi, hes so cute!"
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Remember to like the chapters!!!
9,"Sep 22, 2020",let me just say you should still spend your coins on this to support the creators but I've read ahead a few a episodes and I've been blown away
9,"Sep 17, 2020","I grew up with the Legend of Sun Wukong, so I’m super excited to see a modern portrayal!"
9,"Sep 17, 2020","nooo, why the translator changed it into ""demonic"" it should be ""demon-like"""
9,"Sep 17, 2020","waaaait i just realised why is it ""demonic judge of fire""? bring back my ""demon-like judge of fire""!!! demonic is like implying it is a demon, while demon-like is saying it's just demon-like so it's more fitting. And it actually fits more when Dokja was explaining that it's not a demon, that it's just ""demon-like"". pls. omg. I thought it's demon-like before right? Why did they change it?"
9,"Sep 16, 2020",did they just introduce Mori?
9,"Sep 16, 2020",since I used my coins....am I one of the sponsors 😂😂
9,"Sep 9, 2020",omg I cant stop spending my coins!! author you have seriously nailed it
9,"Aug 26, 2020",When the sponsors list showed up I immediately took an interest in the Black Flame Dragon and Secretive Plotter but now I’m only interest in the Secretive Plotter because their was no information about that sponsor and because I don’t want to lose my senses.
9,"Aug 26, 2020","I had free coins so, what the hell. Why not."
9,"Aug 26, 2020",Yup. Just blew through all my coins from two events.
9,"Aug 25, 2020","Okay im starting to think that the protagonist of the TWSA novel wasn't such a ""good"" guy😨"
9,"Aug 24, 2020","Almost done with the light novel of this series and I can tell you this: Awesome read, even more enjoyable when combined with amazing art, story only gets better ;) Remember to support author with a like/heart btw"
9,"Aug 23, 2020",Spending all my coins to support the creator of my fav novel 💕
9,"Aug 21, 2020",This looks like it's going to be good.
9,"Aug 21, 2020",So Mori Jin sponsored the main character 
9,"Aug 20, 2020",I literally just started reading this and am so disappointed that there are only 8 episodes who ever or whom ever made this please continue i promise ill be the final viewer in 10 years. you only have 3141 more chapters left
9,"Aug 20, 2020","Sooo, what's the conversion rate of our webtoons coins to your sponsor coins? xD"
9,"Aug 20, 2020",I bet he chose the secret plotter
9,"Aug 20, 2020",[Constellation 'Twist Plotter' supports constellation 'Secretive Plotter' a lot.] [Constellation 'Secretive Plotter' ...]
9,"Aug 20, 2020","So, the original story protagonist is a psychopath who recruited psychopaths into his party... but Hyeounsong Lee was a major supporting character?  If the Army man is actually the kind of person whom the protagonist would recruit, not sure I would want to take the Army man."
9,"Aug 19, 2020","this story had a great concept and a really interesting plot, despite being in an overly saturated genre, it makes smart use of its genre by allowing a meta character to understand it the same way the readers do. it works similarly to both a self insert and a self aware character. this will be an enjoyable one for sure"
9,"Aug 19, 2020",mom: Where those all your money go?? *Me spending it all in coins for fast pass episode cos my addicted brain CAN’T wait to read every episode : Idk...😅
9,"Aug 19, 2020",I'm disappointed in the people comparing SWK to Mori Jin
9,"Aug 19, 2020",YJH PLEASE SHOW UP ALREADY 👀
9,"Aug 19, 2020",can i get my first top comment? :)
9,"Aug 19, 2020",Wait this is behind a couple of chapters 
9,"Aug 19, 2020",Man I have spent all my coins in this webtoon and i regret nothing
9,"Aug 19, 2020","“He’s the one that killed everyone in that cabin, Are you sure you want to meet him? Let’s find a way outa here” lol"
9,"Aug 19, 2020","This is way, way better than Solo Levelling. I'm not saying this to be edgy. Thos story will have you biting your nails in suspense, to laughing out loud to causing you to have an emotional breakdown. That's how good it is. "
9,"Aug 19, 2020","webtoon keeps adding series i was alreasy reading 💕 hell yea, great 2 see this webcomic get more love"
9,"Aug 19, 2020","Don't mind me, just spending my coins~ Also I've read the novel and I LOVE IT. I can't wait for everyone else to show up 🥺💞💓"

9,"Oct 1, 2020","Do ya'll read and watch God of Highschool, if so, tell me you also screamed when he mentioned the Monkey King, the equal to heaven, like Jin Mori! 🙈🙈🙈🙈"
9,"Sep 27, 2020","I love how the kid just stuck by his side, it's so cute uwu"

9,"Sep 9, 2022",Me who has been boycotting this for 2 years so I wouldn't feel the pain of ever needing to spend coins- I know it's stupid but I had other things to read like TOTCF
9,"Aug 30, 2022",can't lie this is a bit scary ...what if this becomes real for us as well 🙂🙂🙂🙂

9,"Apr 7, 2022","So dragon ball was about wukong, god of highschool is also about wukong, now this?  Damn wukong really is popular. "
9,"Apr 6, 2022","My theory about this is, what if TWSA is actually a prediction of the author of what's gonna happen in the future. The story does not become a reality. The story is actually what is going to happen in the future and because Dokja is the only person who knew the flow of the story, he's the sole person who has the capability to alter it."
9,"Apr 2, 2022",there is no question at all on why my fav methology god is sun wokung like hes so strongthat his a chinese methology but nearly whole world know about him thats crazy and not just that goku luffy jin mori and more are inpired by him

9,"Nov 2, 2021","okay, HAS ANYONE ELSE NOTICED THAT THERE ARE COMMENTS ON THE RECORDING OF DOKJA WHEN THERE ARE 4 HANDS WITH COINS?!?! THIS IS MY THIRD TIME READING THIS AMD I JUST NOW NOTICED"
9,"Oct 22, 2021",im sorry but a soon as I read sun wukong my mind went right to jin mori from the god of highdchool
9,"Oct 22, 2021",why am i simping for dokja
9,"Oct 20, 2021","anyone wanna bet that this ""secretive plotter"" is the author of TWSA?"
9,"Oct 19, 2021","going back to the beginning is so strange, the way he's explaining the constellation nicknames.... I wonder if these constellations were smaller characters in TWSA? Otherwise it's like a Star Wars fan very slowly explaining that Old Ben is Obi-Wan Kenobi -- it's hard to image you'd think that, it's just a fact that you know..!"
9,"Oct 17, 2021",I hope he picked The Great Sage 😁
9,"Sep 28, 2021",I love this! 🙌🙌
9,"Sep 23, 2021",The Text file copy of TWSA is very much a cheat! hahahha But if I had the choice I will readily choose Secret Plotter. hehehehe
9,"Sep 10, 2021",han exe has stopped working 
9,"Sep 1, 2021",sun wukong?? mori jin became a constellation.. 
9,"Aug 28, 2021","Dokja is truly smth else, and i see the squad is assembling! I hope they escape in time…"

9,"Apr 28, 2021","As soon As i saw Monkey king, I remembered The Great Son Oh-Gong from Hwayugi - I picture Lee seung gi😅🙈"
9,"Apr 27, 2021",This story would be perfect if it was turned into an anime😝like if it's so good in story form imagine it being in anime❤
9,"Apr 27, 2021","Bakugo, is that you?"
9,"Apr 27, 2021","I feel like the secretive plotter could actually be the author of the ""novel"""
9,"Apr 27, 2021",Oh Mh god. The art is breathtaking 
9,"Apr 27, 2021","Did anyone else see the headless guy, he literally had no head 🤯 "

9,"Apr 26, 2021",It’s like edgy weaboo teens naming their video game character
9,"Apr 26, 2021","It's not just me that's very excited right? 😁😁 OMG! LOL Ngakak wqwq huh… hahaha that scene make me laugh. 😂😂 oh, and here I thought he was going to choose that secret plotter or that prisoner or whatever. I think it's kinda interesting. the name that is. Idk if it's true, i might be wrong but I think that's the author (?) I mean he/she did secretly plotting our main character, Dokja Kim in the story which is something that's not on his/her story before. i haven't read the novel yet. anw thx"
9,"Apr 26, 2021",Haha Mr. Han reminds me of Leorio from HXH
9,"Apr 26, 2021",10000000000 COINS INTO STRENGTH
9,"Apr 24, 2021",secretive plotter actually seems interesting
9,"Apr 24, 2021",I hope he picked the secretive dude  o-o
9,"Apr 21, 2021",mr han the father of jumin han?
9,"Apr 16, 2021",Guess what I started reading the story just for the ml and now boom the only thing I'm concerned about is the main plot!!
9,"Apr 11, 2021",Love secret plotter
9,"Apr 9, 2021",Secretive Plotter kind of compatible to him though.
9,"Apr 8, 2021",bet the secretive plotter is secretly the best constellation and that Sangah chose them
9,"Apr 7, 2021","I hope the webtoon has much better translators than the webnovel since the person who translated more than the first half of the novel apparently doesn't even know Korean and just used an app. There were a lot of mistakes ranging from smaller ones like how it should've been ""Yoo Joonghyuk"" instead of ""Yoo Jonghyuk"" to bigger ones like Sangah saying something about an ""ivory life"" when she just said ""Sangah's life"" which should've been a nice little foreshadowing about her (I won't spoil though)."
9,"Apr 4, 2021",i wonder if dokja will ever forget parts of the novel
9,"Apr 2, 2021","As soon as I saw prisoner of the golden headband I knew it was the monkey man, thank you OSP. Alright I bet he got the 3rd one, the plotter just seems on flavor with his innocent reader abilities"
9,"Mar 20, 2021",The monkey king like from the god of high school mori jin if u haven’t read it I highly recommend it
9,"Mar 19, 2021",One is the main character while the other one is a protagonist of the wos novel. a sunfish and a squid.
9,"Mar 19, 2021",The Art Looks Soo Good!!
9,"Mar 17, 2021",Is the protagonist stupid he's the protagonist
9,"Mar 16, 2021",If you read carefully a freaking god said: Now that is justice Lol-demon like Judge of fire
9,"Mar 16, 2021",I just realized if we reach the end of this book does that mean it will happen to us?
9,"Mar 10, 2021","""you dumb, young dumb and broke"" I sing while spending my money on coins."
9,"Mar 5, 2021",wooooh interesting 😁 good luck survivor 
9,"Mar 4, 2021",would you guys believe me if I said I'm reading this inside a train feels so nostalgic 
9,"Mar 2, 2021","ugh, this is so nervewrecking!!!"

9,"Dec 24, 2020",THIS IS A SPOILER SKIP IF U ARE READING GOD OF HIGH SCHOOL~Bruh I didnt know that Mori Jin The Monkey King got put in jail.
9,"Dec 18, 2020",Now a quick word from our sponsor. RAID SHADOW LEGENDS 
9,"Dec 17, 2020",im am confused as hell
9,"Dec 17, 2020",its scp 001 epic
9,"Dec 7, 2020",I really want to have the money aspect be real in webtoon though instead the more you read the more you get
9,"Nov 29, 2020",I was thinking of choosing sponsors 2 or 3 before he explained it and I’m glad I did. 😂
9,"Nov 28, 2020",I'm one of the universe
9,"Nov 28, 2020",What is this? Hunger games????
9,"Nov 27, 2020",I wanted to choose Demonic Judge of Fire before I found out it was Archangel Uriel. I guess I'm really drawn to the Angels eh? 
9,"Nov 26, 2020",oof the fact that he is not the protagonist 
9,"Nov 25, 2020","""He's the main protagonist"" but why does it feels like hecs the main antagonist hahaha"
9,"Nov 23, 2020","Ahh I just realized on the holographic screen showing Dokja they called Uriel ""Demon-like Judge of Fire"" like in the original translation. She said ""Now that is justice lol"" lmao"
9,"Nov 21, 2020",Love Sun Wukong. Prob choose him if I was in this situation
9,"Nov 20, 2020",im really interested to know why Dokja is tryna avoid the main protagonist
9,"Nov 18, 2020",so I know thats its not related to this but what are the coins thing
9,"Nov 17, 2020",Mr. han in black and white is honestly my mood 50% of the time 
9,"Nov 5, 2020",did anyone else notice how calm gilyoung (I believe that is the spelling) looked when dokja said that they should leave?
9,"Oct 31, 2020",I love stories like this where the protagonist of a story isn’t even a protagonist nor a side/background character 
9,"Oct 29, 2020","im waiting for this manhwa to be completed but i think I'll grow old before I even see its completion ;-;

9,"Aug 25, 2020",OMG! I am loving this story. I can't believe I did what I told myself I would not do and buy coins to read more of this. 
9,"Aug 25, 2020",Already very interesting. The in character already shows that he won't hesitate to get rid obstacles. I look forward to the future of this webtoon.
9,"Aug 25, 2020",That glasses guy is on my nerves 
9,"Aug 24, 2020","I hope they do a mass release to catch up with the Korean raws. (Pls do it, I NEED IT!!)"

9,"Aug 24, 2020","This made me want to read the webnovel. I'm Lready on chapter 120, what a good series. Theres so many scenes I'm excited to see illustrated!!"
9,"Aug 24, 2020","Yeah read this in the webnovel app it’s free up to like nearly chapter 50 (but there’s about 500 chapters in total). The work is completed. This WEBTOON does an absolutely amazing job in portraying and following it (with great art by the way <3 ) but if you’re impatient and want to check that out too it’s totally worth. ✌️
Also I REALLY hope this becomes an anime someday."
9,"Aug 23, 2020",hear all my coins making that cling cling sound on the ground as I through them at this webtoon lol.
9,"Aug 22, 2020","And... Here we have a Monkey King again 😍😍😍 I'm going broke spending all my coins, but who cares 😎 I'm on a roll! "

9,"Aug 21, 2020",please let there be 3149 episodes 🙏🙏🙏🙏
9,"Aug 21, 2020",I enjoyed this a lot. So far my negative with this is how are you going to relay on the knowledge of future events when you blatantly change the past? Not sad the edgelord died but that’s like saying jet died for ba’sing sei in ATLA. A lot of stuff changes. Events now happen differently. The MC done goofed because of his pride. Other than that applauds because this is 🔥!
9,"Aug 20, 2020",I need this to come out every hour please
9,"Aug 20, 2020",The plot twist is the coins are the webtoon coins we are spending right now. (~‾∇‾)~

9,"Oct 2, 2022","I'd definitely have chosen the plotter because, obviously, they'd always be a few steps ahead."
9,"Sep 26, 2022",If i was a constellation i'de be too basic based on my user which is Torspec (Spector but cut in half and swapped) lmao Clearly I need more to my name. Rn no one would pick me unless it was the ultimate troll and i'm an all-knowing constellation or some crap and give bonuses based on knowledge like the benefits Dokja has as the reader. 
9,"Sep 22, 2022","Ah, yes. ""Quite Long the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon"" (cuz dokja said it's true name is Quite Long)"
9,"Sep 21, 2022",Crazy but I literally knew it was Wukong before I even got to the actual reveal lol

9,"Aug 31, 2022",I wanna see the Mc aaaaahhh
9,"Aug 30, 2022",I feel like the 3 constellations that Dokja mentioned lightly reflected his personality and traits. This is some great way of indirect charater introduction.

9,"Feb 2, 2022",Hmmm he emphasized “true” when he said “true protagonist” 🤔 Why does it sound like he really really really doesn’t want to meet him and that he has no problem messing with the original plot a little 🤔
9,"Feb 2, 2022",is that the ender dragon? /j
9,"Jan 31, 2022",its so funny myeongo han was pale and frozen for like 5 panels

9,"Jan 23, 2022",Seems kinda corny tbh. The main character sucks (my opinion)
9,"Jan 22, 2022","i think the protagonist of the novel is the antagonist of this story, i mean he was sole survivor, that mean he's the only one survive and if he became the protagonist in the reality then everyone gonna die, so i think the mc gonna take the flag of protagonist from him in real life so that he can survive and even save few peoples"
9,"Jan 22, 2022",uriel best gurlllll!!! she represents us all!!
9,"Jan 19, 2022",thank you for this :D
9,"Jan 13, 2022",That's what I do with eleceed lol.. I read the fan translations then come here and read the chapters once they are available as well. 
9,"Jan 12, 2022",So technically dokja is the main character but also not the main character :D
9,"Jan 6, 2022",do you guys know a game like this? 😆 
9,"Jan 5, 2022",my theory is that he showed interest to dokja because he spotted he read the game.
9,"Jan 5, 2022",Holy shit the MC 
9,"Jan 5, 2022",nice work bro
9,"Jan 3, 2022",I like how the former protagonist has become the antagonist 
9,"Jan 2, 2022",15 squats
9,"Jan 1, 2022",If I were him I would flex so much telling then that I know what’s happening and giving them a few hints to survive anyways I would make them know that I absolutely know everything going on 
9,"Dec 30, 2021",I think the secretive plotter might be the strongest one or as some people are saying it might be the author

9,"May 15, 2021",this is getting interesting 
9,"May 8, 2021","Okay. I am very curious as to how this works. Because someone our Omniscient Reader says was an important side character was in the car where everyone except the Egdelord DIED. And now he's terrified of TWSA's PROTAGONIST kicking in the door to their car. So how much of an asshole is this protagonist?  And if he's read this why doesn't he know how they get off the train?This is a really cool premise, but this bugs me."

9,"Apr 21, 2021","No wonder Mori Jin's been absent in GOH, he was actually out sponsoring Dokha. Also these are all just so beautifully drawn, I am in love"
9,"Apr 20, 2021",I'm holding Dokja Kim personally responsible for reading the entire web novel and enabling the paywall to begin.

9,"Nov 28, 2020","You planned this, you're making consider to buy fast pass. Family!"
9,"Nov 23, 2020",I'm guessing the protag of the original series wasn't a good guy. Probably a Light Yagami type...
9,"Nov 21, 2020","I saw ""The golden Headband and I immediatly thought of Sun WuKong. I fricking knew it!"
9,"Nov 20, 2020","Woah everyone that on the sponsor selection of kim dokja are powerful beings, and also it's kinda fun to see comments guessing who is secretive plotter and the author (whispering spoiler) they're actually companions of Kim Dokja but at the same time NOT"
9,"Nov 19, 2020","Prisoner of the Golden Headband. Hmmm, Wukong is that you??? "
9,"Nov 19, 2020",Is Mori from god of Highschool his sponser like what

9,"Nov 8, 2020",course he knows who each of the sponsors are. he read the darn books. all of them infact. why wouldn't he no it all now. (Oh I know the golden one! It's the Monkey King from Journey to the West! Very awsome guy who becomes extremely imortal.)

9,"Sep 16, 2020",My coins are trembling in fear
9,"Sep 16, 2020",I couldn't wait either lol used up my 5 free coins xD 
9,"Aug 25, 2020","Okay, so As Per Usual, this webtoon is a bit unOrdinary, and the author might of gotten stuck like Cheese in the Trap, but they haven’t conquered the Tower of god or was the God of Highschool. They may not be hiding a Super Secret, be a True Beauty and have good Lookism, and don’t think that their Age Matter. Because we’re Always Human, don’t let them feel a Siren’s Lament, and while we’re in this Small World, Let them rest in their  Sweet Home, Give the April’s Flowers And tell them I Love Yoo."
9,"Jun 1, 2021",I don't like that he is not helping other people. He could have helped his friend sruvive in the first scenario and that leuteinant dude as well cuz he might be usefull as a teammate. Then when choosing sponsors he couldve helped others choose because he know every constallation and can save them from the fate of becoming psycho like with that dragon's sponsorship. Despite knowing everything he is not doing everything he can. At this point he coudve already made his own strong team
9,"Jan 7, 2021","I'm reading the webnovel for the first time while rereading the webtoon, and just wanted to say that Dokja did not choose a constellation. I don't know if it's just unclear to me how the webtoon did not specifically state what Dokja did, but I thought that he'd chosen the Golden Headband guy during my first read, however it was very clearly stated in the webnovel that he didn't."
9,"Sep 25, 2020",Does people know if you look this up you get like ten more episodes
9,"Oct 4, 2020",While reading the novel (I’m still not done and haven’t gotten the confirmation) I’m pretty certain that the secretive plotter is the author of ways of survival
9,"Sep 24, 2020",Just to let everyone know secretive plotter is a VERY important character so pay attention to his reactions 
9,"Aug 30, 2020","this is not cool i thought this was exclusive via webtoon. but why is this available on other manga websites? plus it has been available even before webtoon, and it has more chapters, so why are we paying for a webtoon that has been available on other websites?"
9,"Sep 26, 2020",so just want to say you can read up to chapter  29 for free online  
9,"Sep 26, 2020",I already read 23 chapters and you people are stuck on chapter 8 😂😂😂!!!
9,"Jan 5, 2021","Already read til Chapter 37, well, the plot is good. But the thing I hate the most is the MC, he's just like a young master who likes to scheme but weak and has no guts... I meant, just look at the MC's expression when he faces monster horde/the ""MC"" of the novel, it's like a puppy meets a tiger."
9,"Sep 24, 2020",I already read up to chapter 19 for free on a site other than webtoons bruh who uses coins on OR
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Chapter 21 he will kill the dark sentinel he is a grade 7 demonic monster had he has very strong stats for a grade 7 monster and Kim dokassa will probably have a very strong weapon by the end of chapter 22 and as for his sponsor he will not choose one till the very end if I remember correctly and the he is kinda op for the story and will get more and more powerful or op as the story goes on
9,"Sep 23, 2020",Mc never picked a sponsor btw spoiler.

39,"Jan 27, 2021","gotta love the look on jihyes face before she loses in rock paper scissors, girl doesnt know what hit her, poor thing."
39,"Jan 27, 2021",Jihye: Aren’t you going to share? Dokja: Yessss of course 😁
39,"Jan 27, 2021","i wonder how far people like dokja know about this world, since most of them quit in the first 5-10% of the story"
39,"Jan 27, 2021","Bruh...haha I love how shameless Dokja can be 😂 Also it was great to see Gilyoung show his hyung how capable he can be. A great moment for best boy (I'm gonna miss his new friend, Titano, tho)"
39,"Jan 27, 2021",Can the last movie be Star Wars and dokja can find jungyeok and say “I am your father” just to piss him off
39,"Jan 27, 2021",haha wonder if dinosaur meat tastes like chicken 
39,"Jan 27, 2021","Even if there are Others like Dokja out there No way they're as skilled. he Read Twsa Entirely and won the book as a Reward! the author only gave that skill to him, So if others are out there... Shouldn't their knowledge be limited ? "
39,"Jan 27, 2021",Dokja is a troll as always 😏
39,"Jan 27, 2021",Dokja you sly son of a btch 😏
39,"Jan 27, 2021","The setting is so diverse and Dokja's such a great MC, that it's really hard to find... Anything to dislike about this series. It's just so damn good"

39,"Jan 27, 2021",I'm laughing so hard about he cheating to keep most of the ampules 🤣🤣🤣.
39,"Mar 17, 2021",Dokja really said: ✨Time To Abuse My Skills✨
39,"Jan 27, 2021",Gilyeong is so brave boy despite his age. How mature he is. Every coin I spent here is  so worth it 
39,"Jan 27, 2021",I. can't. stop. fast. passing.... I've fast passed every episode since ep6......I'm addicted.
39,"Jan 27, 2021","I may be the only one sus of this but I think Gilyeong (Bug Boy) didn't misspeak when he said ""when I was young"". I think he may have accidentally slipped up. My theory is he's either a regressor like the main character that OUR main character (Dokja) is trying to save currently. It just happens that OUR main character doesn't know about him. OR. He's also a reader of TWSA like Dokja but he didn't get far into it and he recognizes Dokja did and is making use of that? I'm interested! Thoughts??"

39,"Mar 19, 2021",I was reading the synopsis of this novel/webtoon again and it introduced Dokja as an ordinary office worker. But isn’t it strange that Dokja is mentally able to adapt to these scenarios and become a sort of leadership figure from the very beginning? 👀
39,"Mar 18, 2021",Sometimes this comic is so comedic I can`t believe it`s the same comic from the beginning.For example Train scene when passengers were forced to kill one another just to escape sometime I think there might be two different people creating this comic.
39,"Mar 18, 2021",someone needs to tell crunchyroll about this webtoon

39,"Mar 18, 2021",anyone else extremely stocked that they put the trex under a dragon class? let me explain why this makes me happy lol. So Trexs are known for there incredibly short arms but what if they weren't actually that short and instead used them for flying? well if that were true than it would make sense that we wouldn't have known because hollow bones decompose at a faster rate. some more evidence to prove it is that trexs were scavengers and what's the best scavenger class? animals that could fly. 
39,"Mar 18, 2021","Dokja be like: Activate cheats, abilitate commands and turn on hacks."
39,"Mar 18, 2021","didnt the website say he was the only person who finished the book?  so if there were others, he still has more knowledge than them."

39,"Mar 17, 2021","Unless I'm missing something, it shouldn't be possible for there to be another reader. Dokja was the only reader for years, we even saw most of the chapters only had 1 view. Maybe an alternate reality or different platform? but I feel like that be a pretty convenient out..."

39,"Jan 27, 2021","For anyone posting spoilers: I suggest writing out a comment saying ""SPOILERS"" and then replying to your own comment. I've seen others do this and it seems the best way to not spoil it for others :)"
39,"Mar 17, 2021",Everyone is talking about how dokja was cheating in Rock Paper Scissors but not how he just completely and utterly destroyed a tyrannosaurus friggin rex 
39,"Mar 17, 2021",Now I wonder what fry dinosaur taste like 🤔
39,"Jul 28, 2021","playing rock,paper,scissors against Dokja is a total joke."

39,"Jul 2, 2021","Me when the T-Rex is on fire: ""F O O D?"" and then lo and behold they actually ate the T-rex. Glorious. (Cries at the fact that Dokja totally cheated in Rock Paper Scissors to get all those bottles) Hm, other readers, huh? I thought there was only one view on it, though I guess it was the view count petering out, there were way views on the beginning chapters come to think of it...so they must be going off their memory of the beginning 50 chapters which had 12 views...crazy."
39,"Jun 6, 2021",Gilyeong supremacy 🤩✊
39,"Jun 6, 2021","ok. theory time. he said there must be others like him. so what if all the people that read even 1 episode have knowledge or a similar power to dokjas, up to either a certain level or where ever they stopped reading. still leaving dokja as superior, but making them amazingly powerful"
39,"Jun 6, 2021","jihye: help this weak little girl also jihye: strength Lv 17, helped take down a dinosaur."

39,"Apr 28, 2021",notice how Dokja let the other two win a few bottles? he actually cares 😢
39,"Apr 28, 2021",this kid is just basically a walking pokedex. 
39,"Apr 27, 2021",Dokja has to be the most chaotic neutral character I've ever seen
39,"Apr 26, 2021",I feel like Dokja is getting more and more character development throughout the story; Especially since he isn’t alone anymore 
39,"Mar 30, 2021","t-rexs are so badass they're considered land dragons lol, and love how you can never underestimate gilyeong"

39,"Mar 21, 2021",imagine cheating at rock paper scissors goodnight
39,"Mar 20, 2021",Dokja: Why are things different from the book? || Also Dokja: *continually uses his knowledge to change things from the way they were in the book* || Also Dokja: *finds out there are potentially other omniscient characters out there* *doesn’t even bat an eye*
39,"Mar 18, 2021",they should make this into an anime.
39,"Mar 18, 2021",The smug look he had on his face when he started playing 
39,"Mar 18, 2021",I'd like to thank the writer for writing such an amazing webtoon🔥dokja is the character that I've related to the most out of all the 100s of manhwas and mangas that I've read. he is literally the representation of how I'd try to survive an apocalypse. this is why I love this webtoon with all my heart 🙆♥
39,"Mar 18, 2021","if there are actually more people like dokja then they couldn't have gotten too far into the book since it showed that after a while, he was the only one who was reading it"
39,"Mar 18, 2021",this series is amazing and thrilling and incredibly complex. i LOVE IT and i need moRE immEdIatElY
39,"Mar 18, 2021","Gilyeong is going to be an interenting character. He's full of surprises indeed. Btw, Dokja could have been more fair with the rest of them... cheating... tch"
39,"Mar 18, 2021","Dokja...you deliberately gave 2 potions to them, took rest 16. You could still give at least one strength potion to her. Because she is ""a fragile little girl."""
39,"Mar 17, 2021",There's others like him? Seems plausible but he's the only one who read to the end. Some people who read the start would have some advantage over those who didn't read but Dokja is super op. Unless they also have the reader skills? Probably not. But maybe someone was binging for a few days and got well into the story idk
39,"Mar 17, 2021","""you just have to kill everything "" If only it was that easy ."
39,"Mar 17, 2021","Dokja, you cheater 😂"
39,"Mar 17, 2021",At least give her one ampule 🤣 the poor swordswoman
39,"Mar 17, 2021",If you want to support the original author you can read the official translation of the novel this is based on at Webnovel app or website
39,"Mar 17, 2021","*sniff sniff""smells like meat"""

39,"Mar 17, 2021",Imagine being on of those twasa readers that dropped it right before the revelation of a huge plot twist and now getting f^cked bcs of it
39,"Mar 17, 2021",gilyoung is this fandom's child isn't he? We all agree he should be protected at all costs 🥺
39,"Mar 17, 2021",dokja's so petty lmao
39,"Mar 17, 2021",God bless the cleaners and redrawers of this comic 
39,"Mar 17, 2021",I love how Dokja let his team mates win twice haha!

The T-Rex in this comic is super on point with the movie, so props on that.

Lee Gilyoung asked to go to the bathroom. Back when Dokja broke that statue, when Sangah and Huiwon said they had 'girl things' to do, that was because Sangah was on her period.

39,"Feb 17, 2022",So if there's other people who are similar to Dokja wouldn't they just be Readers instead of Omniscient Readers. In the first chapter it's shown that others did initially read TWSA but only Dokja was the one to read it to the end thus making him Omniscient.
39,"Jan 22, 2022",This con man 😂😂😂
39,"Jan 16, 2022","dokja using his skill for rock paper scissors is hilarious 😭 also i forgot that jihye and gilyeong have the same surname. i also thought it before but it would be cute if they were to get along well, younger character bonding or smth haha"

Just faces the t-rex and blinds it. they kick it's butt. the moment he set it on fire I wanted to eat it, and the next thing she thought was, 'I smell meat'. 🤣 didn't want to share the potions and just reads her mind in rock paper scissors. lol. loved it. The only part that made me roll my eyes was ""t-rex uses skill: fear"" -you do know you are already a t-rex right?.."

39,"Mar 21, 2021","Honestly he toooj too many ampules. If it's a fair cut he could give everyone 5 (since it's 4 people). But we all know he is trying to give that chick less and give himself more. So if he gave her 2 and gave the others 4 for each he would be left with 10. A lot and he would be ""fair"" because he spent 10 for everyone and got himself alone 10. Smh he's too greedy to think about the masterpieces he's carrying and the fact he should care for their levels"
39,"Mar 21, 2021",What does he mean people out there like him. He’s the only person who read the story so how can there be people like him

39,"Mar 28, 2022",when Dokja was drooling 😂 nobody talks about how they end up eating dinosaur's meat...😂
39,"Mar 27, 2022",Dokja is somewhat greedy
39,"Mar 27, 2022",Dokja's face when he has all the ampules was pure gold
39,"Mar 24, 2022",of course there are other people like dokja.. if you read the first ep you will see that there were a few viewers of twsa in the beginning... 
39,"Mar 19, 2022",these people might soon pop up in other webtoons as extras. why? cuz they're excellent actors lol
39,"Mar 1, 2022",Damn and I thought rock paper scissors was only sacred and important at summer camp where they have the book of molten lava and if your name appears in it than you’ve already used your molten lava for the one time you’re allowed to use it in your lifetime and they have this whole hype up thing and it says whole thing where someone goes in the lake if they lose don’t know why you need to know that but you did

39,"Sep 5, 2021","Before I was like ""These people shouldn't pull that card! Where they'd be like there are others like him...Because he was the only reader of those 3149 chapters ""... So..."
39,"Aug 29, 2021","Other people like Dokja, interesting. He did mention there were other readers but they all dropped off except for him. Maybe they know up to where they stopped reading. Or they have the same ability he does and can just speed read the novel. Can't wait to see how things unfold. "
39,"Aug 26, 2021",I kinda feel bad that she lost all the rounds in Rock Paper Scissors 
39,"Aug 24, 2021","guys I know that this is a little bit late (by late i mean about the manhwa release) this kind of manhwa is my favorite because it is proving that not all the time the MC is having the best adventures or just that it si not on him that the world i evolving for example the anime ""gobling slayer"" so i just wanna thank the auteur for the master piece he is writting"

39,"Jan 27, 2021","Tyrannosaurus Rex activated the skill, coronavirus fear🤣"
39,"Jan 27, 2021",and there goes the rest of the Jurassic Park trilogy
39,"Jan 27, 2021",Dokja is working her over quite well if you play a lot of games and get the arc. she will eventually be his follower cause he is willing to help others where Yu isnt.
39,"Jan 27, 2021","They never state the penalty for failure, that would scare me more than the monsters."
39,"Jan 27, 2021","That cheat move was real slick, but he should have at least gave her something to use, be better than nothing in a fight. I mean yeah if strength is her highest stat then she would need something to balance out the other ones wouldn't she?"

39,"Jan 27, 2021","I wonder how strong dokja is gonna be, he is just like sung jin woo, becoming so strong and he already knows so much about a lot of people in that world, and his secret skills are so OP, I look forward to seeing what he turns into."
39,"Jan 27, 2021",“ENRAGED TREX DNA AMPULE” Bruh if Dokja doesn’t turn into a TRex imma be big sad.
39,"Jan 27, 2021",Moar!!!!! stop the presses for the other toons work on this obe
39,"Jan 27, 2021",Never bought something so fast
39,"Jan 27, 2021",I don't need sleep I need answers.
39,"Aug 29, 2021","I think the bug kid is a Regressor as well. if he been through it and so he may be older in the inside than the outside. Idk that's my theory, it would explain our ""Protag""'s interest in him. "
39,"Jun 19, 2021",What does dokja mean there are people like him? There can only be one special boy Dokja >:( also didnt he say that he was the only reader?
39,"May 1, 2021","He really did a Saki K. move with Rock, Paper, Scissors lmao"
39,"Apr 9, 2021",There are others like him. But he's the only one who finished reading the story right? Not that it matters since stuff is changing anyway
39,"Mar 23, 2021","oh my God he did her dirty, btw whose driving the helicopter"
39,"Mar 19, 2021","I suspect that since Dokja has the power of the reader and the reader is there for all of Jungheok Yu's regressions, Dokja will also be sent back to the 1st scenario with his memories intact once a regression happens."
39,"Mar 18, 2021",Anna Croft????? Soundslikesombodyfromabookthatdied-
39,"Mar 17, 2021",when will dokja tell them this whole thing was a book and he knows all what happens next and he have no supporting constalation *he burnt that t.rex to a crisp*
39,"Mar 17, 2021",I love Dokja that bastard 😂 he let huiwon and gilyoung get some but jihye got none (prob cause she already had enough stats) but still it’s funny
39,"Mar 17, 2021",Thank god Im not the only kid who read dinosaur books as a toddler 😭
39,"Mar 17, 2021","Lucky for Dokja he can just cheat, while I'm out here losing literally all the rock, paper, scissors"
39,"Mar 17, 2021",i'm wondering who's the author of twsa. what if it's dokja himself who wrote it for him so everyone can survive?
39,"Mar 17, 2021",gotta love how they only started to fight after all those other guys were dead xD
39,"Mar 17, 2021",gilyeong is dangerously precious.
39,"Mar 17, 2021",let me just come out and say I'm obsessed with this comic it's one of the best I've read in a long time and I love the art style it all fits together so nicely
39,"Mar 17, 2021","I laughed so hard, ah Dokja you're scamming skills are too good🤣🤣"
39,"Mar 17, 2021",not me wanting to taste summa that dino meat myself °-°
39,"Mar 17, 2021","""There are others like me out there."" - Well, even if you were the only one that made it to the end of that story, there were at least a dozen people that made it up to Chapter 50 of TWSA. It's possible those other people that only dipped their toes in so many years ago did in fact recognize the situation they were in once shit actually hit the fan. It's not exactly likely considering how many years passed since then, but it's a possibility."
39,"Mar 17, 2021",I feel sad for the Titano goodbye
39,"Mar 17, 2021","Damn, Naver is so many episodes ahead 🥲"
39,"Jan 27, 2021",imagine just speeding through the episode to comment
39,"Jan 27, 2021",DOKJA U F***IN CHEATER THATS NOT FAIR
39,"Jan 27, 2021",With the poser my 5 coins I nos see the future.
39,4 days ago,So..are they going to Jurassic Park 2 next? 
39,4 days ago,"Hey. That's not Rexy, who is this impostor?!"
39,5 days ago,"FINALLY....the story line has greatly improved along with the vastly reduced continual narration by the main character that was driving me ape crap.  The earlier narrations to me was acting like 'spoilers' while the dialog between the characters were basically non existent. I had to slog thru the 1st several chapters as if I were knee deep in swamp reeds which is something a non avid reader would do...they'd quit. 
Luckily the author realized it & soared."
39,6 days ago,The constellation Feykroro is pleased by the series.
39,"Oct 10, 2022","I think Dokja unconsciously relates to Gilyeong.Maybe because of similar past, that they both are comfortable with each other."
39,"Oct 9, 2022",Dokja a menace fr fr
39,"Oct 8, 2022",I honestly think that was highly unfair of Dokja to keep the most of the viles since all of them helped him in defeating the T-Rex 😅 he at least could've given 2 viles to Jihey like he gave to others
39,"Oct 8, 2022",😳 others like Dokja!? But how's that possible!? I don't think they might know much about TWSA since only Dokja followed the story till it's end!
39,"Oct 8, 2022",Dokja pulled a Tanjirou there!! Hinokami Kaguya!!
39,"Oct 8, 2022",Lil Gilyoung has a dinosaur encyclopaedia!!😭😭 he's so cuteee!! babyyy

Episode,Date,Review
119,"Aug 24, 2022"," 7942 💀😭 It's a Korean text slang that kind of means ""friends"", coming from Dionysus, it probably means a half-assed apology telling Dokja to not be angry because they're friends lmao, really fits his personality."
119,"Aug 24, 2022",Not Dionysus sucking up to Dokja after nearly fcking him over😭🤣
119,"Aug 24, 2022","wish i could get a piggy back ride from kdj😭😭 so good to see everyone again, onto the next scenario!!!"
119,"Aug 24, 2022",Dokja stop thinking of the Persephone version of Yoo Sangah challenge: Impossible 
119,"Aug 24, 2022",I love how Dokja just constantly fucks things up for everyone and then makes a surprised pikachu face at the consequences of his actions appearing
119,"Aug 24, 2022",I misread it as “Expert Face Sitter”
119,"Aug 24, 2022",Jeon Ildo's eyes are really creepy lol
119,"Aug 24, 2022","Dokja. To others, a strange hope. To his friends, a good friend. To us, we are reading about a reader who reads to survive."
119,"Aug 24, 2022",no one with eyes that creepy can ever be a good guy
119,"Aug 24, 2022","Dionysus doing the thing where you almost get a friend killed, and you just come back with a ""Hey buddy, how you feeling?"""
119,"Aug 24, 2022",hes gonna appear soon!!!! one of the coolest characters in the entire series!!! aaaa cant wait to see how the manhwa will adapt this arc
119,"Aug 24, 2022","WHY IS THAT JAPANESE GUY SO HANDSOME, LORD SLEEPY-C, PLEASE STOP MAKING SIDE CHARACTERS SO HOT JUST FOR THE STORY TO KILL THEM (I don't remember whether that Izumi guy will die ty)"
119,"Aug 24, 2022",the contrast between sangah and persephone 😭😭 so good
119,"Aug 24, 2022","This webtoon is so crazy unique, that I have no idea what's coming next after each scenario. I absolutely love it. "
119,"Aug 24, 2022","Neutral King/Switzerland, no! "
119,"Aug 24, 2022",i wanna say 'this is the fun part' but then I remember this is ORV and everything here is fun
119,"Aug 24, 2022","sjjsjskd I love this; in the webnovel one gets the mental picture of Dokja being embarrassed cuz he thinks of Perse on YSA shape w/ garter belts, in here it's more like he remembers YSA looking evil af and is scared 😂 Also:  Sub-scenario rewards: money, adoption papers; failure: banned "
119,"Sep 28, 2022",LMAO - Attribute: Half-assed intellectual🤣🤣🤣
119,"Aug 24, 2022",Brooo Dokja marry me
119,"Aug 24, 2022","if persephone can shapeshift into anyone i wonder if she’ll ever shift into jonghyuk,,,, i’ll keep wishing "
119,"Aug 24, 2022",Can't wait for the sixth scenario. Not my favorite but we'll soon be introduced to a very small person with a VERY large temper 👀
119,"Sep 28, 2022","The third group of people, those who exploit others for survival... Sounds similar to Dokja huh... lol"
119,"Aug 26, 2022",for me Omniscient Reader is much better than Solo Leveling. 👌
119,"Aug 24, 2022",Dokja giving Sangah a piggy back ride is one of the cutest things ever😍😂😂especially after his visit and interaction with Persephone🌝
119,"Aug 24, 2022",Now this is where we activate bookmark “incite” as a trap card
119,"Aug 24, 2022","If anyone is looking for another webtoon with a similar vibe to this one, try Mythic Item Obtained. It's new, but it has really good artwork, great characters, and a really good storyline that has a lot of potential. It posts on Thursdays. I'm not affiliated with the story. I'm just putting the recommendation out there, because I have a really hard time finding webtoons that are similar to the style and storylines I like, and figured there might be others in the same boat. "
119,"Sep 25, 2022",vacation spot ☠️☠️
119,"Sep 28, 2022","""half assed intellectual"" I have never related to something more in my life 💀💀"
119,"Sep 28, 2022",kyrgios soon :D
119,"Sep 21, 2022","7 9 4 2 in Korean 칠 구 사 이 or (chil-gu-sa-ie). In Korean 친구 (chin-gu) is friends. 친구사이 means just friends, so if someone asks if your in a relationship, and you respond 7942, it means your just friends! Dionysis doesn't want to give the wrong vibes, lol"
119,"Aug 24, 2022",i'm going crazy about some of this panelssssss AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
119,"Sep 28, 2022","""They edited it to look like some ad for a vacation spot"" oh yes, come kill monsters at our resort, it'll be so fun and relaxing they said haha"
119,"Sep 28, 2022","So people are told they are free to not participate, and then slaughtered for not participating? Yeah, par for the course for whichever sadistic freak came up with this game."
119,"Aug 24, 2022","Man, I missed last week's episode. But it's full of angst so I'm glad I missed it lol"
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Huiwon in a full suit got me acting UNWISE
119,"Sep 28, 2022",My friend who read the web novel told me this webtoon isn’t gonna catch up to the end for another ten years 💀 maybe I’ll just read that 😅
119,"Sep 28, 2022","Those are some weird eyes... Goodbye, sir... "
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Imagine having 'half-assed intellectual' as your attribute 😂
119,"Oct 3, 2022",just realised when Dokja becomes a constellation he'll be called 'Omniscient reader'. Feel really slow for just figuring it out now 💀
119,"Sep 28, 2022",The Constellation [The Sadistic Chicken Lord] is curious as to what the info for the 6th main scenario is
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Not Dokja thinking of Persephone Sangah after just waking up XD
119,"Oct 2, 2022","Well I know why that Constalation likes him, who did more things that settled everything without comprimise any part as Dokja? He almost fullfill the Cathastroph scenario without killing the main boss."
119,"Sep 29, 2022",stranger danger! red flag red fag!
119,"Sep 28, 2022",😭😭 that dude is so eerie looking  
119,"Sep 28, 2022",huiwon🥰
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Well… I’m all caught up… and I just learned this is originally a novel… time to start reading a book again :P
119,"Sep 29, 2022",“Half assed intellectual” is what I will be calling myself as from now on😂
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Found the snake
119,"Sep 28, 2022","Dokja: head empty, Sangah in a dress with a garter belt"
119,"Sep 28, 2022","To be fair, Dokja is a king who exploits others; he admits it himself lol. I'm sure all the kings will be great friends! ... As if"
119,"Sep 28, 2022","Pretty sure the next arc will have to be changed a little (it was pretty offensive in the novel), so I'm excited to see what the Webtoon will give us!"
119,"Sep 28, 2022",You are special. You are loved.
119,"Sep 28, 2022",His eyes are scary
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Ildo's face gave me a heart attack while reading LMAO
119,"Sep 28, 2022","I'm not lying when I say I fell in love with this webtoon, I literally started it two days ago! "
119,"Sep 26, 2022",t[he constellation webtoon addict is pleased by the plot *5 coins donated*]
119,"Oct 3, 2022","[The constellation that was recommended this star channel and did not regret is fond of you, and will reveal his nickname]"
119,"Oct 2, 2022",its getting quite interesting
119,"Oct 1, 2022","AHHHHHHHH IM GONNA MEET ONE OF MY FAVE CHARACTERS NOW, CANT WAIT TO SEE U MY OTHER MC 💍🧎"
119,"Oct 1, 2022","wait, the so the neutral kind lied about the 6th scenario having no penalty if one doesn't participate?"
119,"Sep 29, 2022",The neutral king doesn’t seem so neutral to me though… But maybe it’s that he gives 0 fkcs about anyone’s life
119,"Oct 7, 2022","7942 sounds like “chil gu sa e”, which is a play on the words “chin gu sag e”, which translates to “let’s be friends”"
119,"Oct 5, 2022","OH MY GODDDNDJDDJ HYUNSUNG AND HEEWON PELALSOESJSB a good day to be bi, very good day 🧘‍♂️🧘‍♂️🧘‍♂️"
119,"Oct 5, 2022","A choice can be perceived as two sides of a fence, so to be an expert fence sitter would mean your just kinda in the middle."
119,"Oct 4, 2022",Day 118 of voicing all the characters
119,"Oct 3, 2022","Really? Is no one talking about ""Netural diplomacy""? That's a pretty blatant typo."
119,"Oct 2, 2022",Yeah…that’s pretty bold to say when you’re sitting on the fence.  
119,"Oct 1, 2022",my bad y'all but the neutral king can get it
119,"Sep 30, 2022","TMI: King Gwanghae hadn't been appreciated till nowadays. He was recorded as Gwanghae-gun, which means prince Gwanghae, the tyrant cannot be accepted as a king. But well... history is the record of the winner."
119,"Sep 29, 2022",I just love how Sangah slept through the entire episode
119,"Sep 29, 2022",Namwoon will be missed and I'm sure he's sad he won't be building robots with KDJ
119,"Sep 29, 2022",DOKJA SURPRISED FACE LMAOOO PRICELESS
119,"Sep 29, 2022",AND THE CONTRAST BETWEEN YSA AND PERSEPHONE????? 😭😭😭
119,"Sep 29, 2022",LMAO DIONYSUS 
119,"Sep 29, 2022",I'm calling that the serpent is gonna be a Naga
119,"Sep 29, 2022",Dokja pls be shirtless soon omg 😳
119,"Sep 29, 2022",dude in the frame for watching videos to prepare has bigger ta tas than me
119,"Sep 29, 2022","Get a bad feeling Sangah isnt just passed out from fatigue and hangover, but I hope I’m wrong. I feel like Dionysus tried something, but we shall see. "
119,"Sep 28, 2022","There's no penalty for not participating, but the reward for clearing is absolutely necessary to survival."
119,"Sep 28, 2022","7942 in korean is chil-gu-sa-i which sounds similar to ""chingu sayi"" meaning something like between friends or friendly relationship lol! I like the wordplay!"
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Someone who exploits others for their own survival? Sounds like a snake to me… 🐍🗡
119,"Sep 28, 2022",why is every one crying in commends
119,"Sep 28, 2022",I swear the numbers were different in the novel. 
119,"Sep 28, 2022","the next character coming has a ""tiny"" temper "
119,"Sep 28, 2022","If it isn't at least the world-eating serpent, I'm gonna be so disappointed"
119,"Sep 28, 2022","""They will eventually meet a horrible end as the price for not participating in the scenario"" so much for no penalties, huh? "
119,"Sep 28, 2022",question for the other readers. I have seen it mentioned that this webcomic is based on an actual book? is it multiple books or just one ? and if so where could I purchase it or find it cause I really want to check this series out 
119,"Sep 28, 2022","Wow the mc didn't even have to go looking for the snake, it went to him"
119,"Oct 5, 2022","Dyonisus really said ""ily bestie, don't be mad 💕"""
119,"Oct 4, 2022",Neutral king is kinda creepy. I don't like it ·_· Thanks for the amazing episode authors and translator-nim 💖
119,"Oct 3, 2022",how do you read the novel of this?
119,"Oct 2, 2022",Does the 2nd type/group of ppl volunteer to go fight or not? I'm confused. Do the texts mean they will observe a while b4 heading in?
119,"Oct 1, 2022",Why do this dude’s eyes look lifeless wtf
119,"Sep 30, 2022",Just binge read this in three days! Absolutely amazing!
119,"Sep 30, 2022",we gonna see jelly yjh soon <3
119,"Sep 30, 2022",The skeptic in me wouldn't even trust a scenario you didn't have to participate in 🤣
119,"Sep 30, 2022",i love this webtoon sm
119,"Sep 30, 2022",Huiwon looks so good in a suit. style icon. ❤️
119,"Sep 30, 2022",I guess they really want him to succeed against the snake if they’re preemptively threatening their son into making nice. That’s the text equivalent of a friendship bracelet. Though if our favorite Delusional Demon finds out that Kim Dokja died again and had to go somewhere else because of a ban I feel things would go poorly. 
119,"Sep 29, 2022","Dokja rolling into town with his adopted children, trusted lieutenants, and hungover girlfriend.  Goals. "
119,"Sep 29, 2022",is it just me or one kid is missing?? the one whose older than the two of the other kids who has headphones on. Where is he?? He kind of suddenly just disappeared 
119,"Sep 29, 2022","is the serpent going to be Jörungandr? The serpent from Norse mythology that swallowed it's tail, circled the globe, and started Ragnarok"
119,"Sep 29, 2022",Gwanghae?? omfgg
119,"Sep 29, 2022","Did someone say ""EXPLOITS""?*sips Yorkshire Tea*
I believe this time we'll get a PERFECTLY BALANCED scenario with no exploits"
119,"Sep 28, 2022",wait why will the non participants die tho
119,"Sep 28, 2022",somebody here  prepare an antidote..... to give dokja
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Is the neutral king the serpent?
119,"Sep 28, 2022","I thought the first group would die because they won't level up by skipping a scenario, but death as a reward for not doing it? Little too extreme in my pov..."
119,"Sep 28, 2022",The details to make the ending panel so menacing. So good.
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Expert Fence-Sitter sounds kinda lame for a true neutral alignment
119,"Sep 28, 2022",I'm feeling some hunger games vibes here
119,"Sep 28, 2022",so which grp of ppl do you belong?
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Me going back to the panel of the 2nd group of people: 👀
119,"Sep 28, 2022","this is unrelated but I don't remember, what happened to the guy with the fortress skill, the one that could summon turrets to defend an area? I forgot if they mentioned it already x.x"
119,"Sep 28, 2022","""Ahh we're friends now bro!""This Dionysus reminds me a lot of Dionysus in the game Hades..."
119,"Sep 28, 2022","Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung were so cute in the first few pages (?) ❤️ I love the kids sooo much!! They are my little sunshines <33 Spoiler alert for the rest of my comment!!!!  Ahhh, we're meeting lsk again in the next update - I can't wait to see how they'll portray the whole scene ^^ And then we're off to Peace Land!! I miss hsy ://"
119,"Sep 28, 2022",He Made it out the Underworld but Fighting a Serpent that looks like a Snake Titan or just a Huge snake could be the size as the creature that Dokja Have slayed from the beginning Episodes and where he made the Deal with his New Partner 
119,"Sep 28, 2022",I too am a half-assed intellectual 😂
119,"Sep 28, 2022",snitch 
119,"Sep 28, 2022",The piggyback ride 😭❤️
119,"Sep 28, 2022",HIII

119,"Sep 28, 2022",AW HEEELLLLLL NO WHY HE LOOK LIKE THAT 
119,"Sep 28, 2022","""There aren't any penalties for not participating"" ""they meet a horrible fate as price for not participating"" Either there's a penalty or not, which is it?"
119,"Sep 22, 2022",Darn it my first time wasting my money on this series GOD

119,"Sep 29, 2022",GOD i dont like his face........
119,"Sep 29, 2022",i dont understand it anymore
119,"Sep 29, 2022","Ok it's been confirmed that Dokja has a thing for chinese dress and garter belts and Yoo Sangah in the outfit is already making him lose his mind. Now imagine if it was our dear sunfish protagonist in the outfit. He'd self destruct after a brain overload lol. 4th wall, gone. (I know there was official art of it but imagine if it was canon and Dokja was in the room.)"
119,"Sep 29, 2022","yess finally i have waited so much for this, it was worth it?, Hell Yeah IT WAS"
119,"Sep 29, 2022","""the constellation who calls for *netural* deplomacy""..."
119,"Sep 29, 2022",I personally know those who belong in the third group way too well 
119,"Sep 29, 2022",SOOYEONG SOOYEONG SOOYEONG!!! AHHHH! WE GONNA SEE HER AGAIN! AND SANGSOO GONNA HAPPEN THEN YEAH! WHOO!
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Him carrying her is really sweet..anyone else could but I assume he feels it’s his fault for her condition so he’s carrying her as it’s his responsibility. That’s really sweet of him
119,"Sep 28, 2022",gosh!!! I'm simping over kim dokja❤️‍🔥 
119,"Sep 28, 2022",They way Dokja and Sangah always remind me of Kirito and Asuna 😭❤
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Is the neutral king the snake he’s supposed to kill? I guess Persephone wants a new toy.
119,"Sep 28, 2022",his eyes...
119,"Sep 28, 2022","Huh I always assumed the scenarios around the world would start at the same time, but guess not. I wonder if this will be an international scenario..."
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Why I find dion so adorable in this chapter? I'm such a simp mygaassh
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Still very long for the arc I am anticipating for the 1st Volume but we are close to the arc before it.
119,"Sep 28, 2022","Lol, Dio really never fails to make you laugh. Also, creepy eyed neutral dude, I dint wanna go with you. 💀"
119,"Sep 28, 2022",neutral king is sketchy lol
119,"Sep 28, 2022","IM HERE! AND I HAVENT FINISHED MY COMMENT ON THE LAST CHAPTER BUT THIS ONE IS OUT SO HOW COULD I NOT READ IT. Huiwon in a suit >>>> (Huiwon in general tbh) AND DOKJA STILL THINKING ABOUT PERSEPHONES VERSION OF YSA 💀 Just the trauma? I think NOT. And we get the first non-compulsory scenario (intriguing)! Along with the very spooky Jeon Ildo - what a pleasure 🤨 honestly have no clue what’s going to happen next, so this is very exciting! See y’all next week <33"
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Good evening 👀
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Ima miss Namwoon
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Thats cute Dionysus 
119,"Sep 28, 2022",OMG OMG OMG OMG 
119,"Sep 28, 2022",damn he's creepy 
119,"Sep 28, 2022","It's got to be jarring for Dokja to wake up and see the people he just met in the Underworld, but knowing they're not the same person. Also, his commentary of the video stream looking like a vacation spot is hilarious, he's not wrong though. Tropical forest, nature, cute animals (?) and a hot guy..."
119,"Sep 28, 2022",well he get more op fine out on the next episode 
119,"Sep 28, 2022","Do they meet a horrible end too? Don't wanna be mean, but kinda hope so"
119,"Sep 28, 2022","""Already...?!"" that can't be good, what we gotta fight now? "
119,"Sep 28, 2022",seeing this after reading the novel just hits diff
119,"Sep 28, 2022","""It must have been hard on her too since she was hungover..."" oh yes, it's great when all your best options are drunk 😅"
119,"Sep 28, 2022",Well I guess someone was bound to try and exploit the Landless King sooner or later. Hang in there Dokja
119,"Sep 5, 2022",SO GOOD TAKE MY COINS 
119,"Sep 3, 2022",It’s always fun seeing how this world meshes with ours. Like how yongsan station is an actual place in Korea. It makes the story more engaging for me personally.
119,"Aug 31, 2022",I knew something was off about this man. He gave me the creeps
119,"Aug 29, 2022",i really do love spending my coins to this webtoon. huge fan of its novel. no regrets.
119,"Aug 29, 2022",Huiwon is so pretty. She is best girl imo
119,"Aug 28, 2022",Ugh I forgot how much I disliked the neutral king
119,"Aug 26, 2022",Wouldn't being banned from the underworld technically be a good thing? Goes to heaven by default?
119,"Aug 25, 2022","being banned from the underworld sounds like it would suck. wandering the earth after death, unable to participate, for all eternity."
119,"Aug 25, 2022",the eyes from neutral king are creepy tho
119,"Aug 25, 2022",Dokja carrying Sangah despite his trauma from Persephone using her form to exploit him. And Duonysus is that friend that left you behind at the party cause you were drunk asleep on the couch.
119,"Aug 24, 2022","[The constellation ""The Red King""  is excited about who's coming next.]"
119,"Aug 24, 2022",Dokja be looking at sangah in thaaaaaatt way😏
119,"Aug 24, 2022","Lmao Dionysus using text slang to say friends as a ""sorry you almost died in the underworld, bestie"" "
119,"Aug 24, 2022",hey if I wanted to spoil this for myself where could i read ahead in the light novel? I did it for The Beginning After the End and I was not disappointed and I expect the same of this
119,"Aug 24, 2022","On next week's episode of Life With Dokja: just as everyone was feeling relieved that they wouldn't have to participate in this new scenario, Dokja volunteers and everybody else accepts their fate as they raise their hands in solidarity. When in doubt, follow the crazy guy with all the crazy plans."
119,"Aug 24, 2022",Love how they look out for each other. Can't wait for the next scenario.
119,"Aug 24, 2022",HSY WILL APPEAR IN A DRESS HERE IIRC FAGSHDJKSLAOAJAJAJJA
119,"Aug 24, 2022","i’m so excited, i love this webtoon so much "
119,"Aug 24, 2022",eyebrows on fleek
119,"Aug 24, 2022",I think we already found the serpent 🐍. I'm looking at you Jeon 👀.
119,"Aug 24, 2022",here marks the beginning of dokja and Dionysius’s friendship 
119,"Aug 24, 2022","Man, that guy has massive tids �� Or is that a girl? I can't figure it out lmao"
119,"Aug 24, 2022","[Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" has a wary feeling to the neutral king, as he might betray Dokja and the gang later on.]"

Episode,Date,Review
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Dokja really just became Aang the last Airbender🤜🏻🌬💨
85,"Dec 29, 2021",It's so interesting how Dokja both needs to use his power as a reader and has to become a part of the novel in order to succeed.
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Lmao first words of Dokja… oh no… I hope he didn’t come here to beat me up..”Mean While” JUK has his enemy face planted in the ground😂😂😂 makes sense🤦🏻‍♂️… not all book worms have common sense…. 
85,"Dec 29, 2021",“I’ll be the one to kill you.” 🤣😂😂😂😂 Like BrUuuUUuH.
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Ended a bit sad when you think about it all. 
85,"Dec 29, 2021","I love that Dokja’s understanding of everyone is already pretty high but after fighting them and seeing their true selves in defeat, he not only understands more but sympathizes with them too. "
85,"Dec 29, 2021","Junghyeok saying that he'll be the one to kill Dokjaa while giving him mana 🤣🤣. Sure, actions speak louder than words..."
85,"Dec 30, 2021",What’s gayer: being gay OR bringing back your rival from the brink of death so you can kill them yourself later in the story in a more dramatic and plot-thematic way ????
85,"Dec 29, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" was amazed on the application of the skill and is praising its flexibility.] [5 coins have been sponsored.]"
85,"Dec 29, 2021","""im doing this because i have to be the one to kill you"" whatever you say bro. you probably coulda just stabbed him then and there XD "
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Junghyeok really said the cliche line 🤣 
85,"Dec 30, 2021",Dokja is really growing on him you can tell lol
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Junghyeouk: be like no one is taking your first time (death) but me
85,"Dec 29, 2021",One of the personalities of the Constellation [Lazy Broke Weeb] pities the returnee. 5 coins have been gifted
85,"Dec 30, 2021","Junghyeok really just revealed that he’s a tsundere, huh…"
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Junghyeok and Dokja are becoming best friends. “Hurry Dokja!” “i’ll be the one to kill you.” “Impressive.” Lmao they both don’t wanna admit it 🤣
85,"Dec 29, 2021","Love this. Great action, great plot, great characters, great pacing. The author deserves every bit of coin I use for each new chapter."
85,"Dec 29, 2021","Ah yes, one step closer to becoming the avatar."
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Hot dang they sure know how to flip flop their characters between likable and unlikable.
85,"Jan 13, 2022","I like how ilsang and Dokja are similar in some ways. Both having op powers and wanting to be the main character. The only difference was Dojka is a observant reader,  and is more mature compared to, Ilsang who got the opportunity when he was younger and more reckless. Which caused more harm than good. He killed random creatures on sight, he wiped out villages of insect people. He has a hero complex and feels entitled to everything. Look at the way he treated Sangah. (More in the comment below)"
85,"Dec 29, 2021",They make such an amazing team/duo😩🖤I was dying waiting for this for a week and it didn't disappoint🖤
85,"Dec 29, 2021",I was wondering why he hadn’t used the bookmark skill in a while but it was super cool to see it used like this. I’m glad that the skills he learns seem to be used throughout the story and not just used once and forgotten
85,"Dec 29, 2021",i feel like being a dokkeabi just means more taxes and crap
85,"Feb 2, 2022","“I’m going to be the one to kill you.” 
and they say romance is dead "
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Not Junghyeok promising to be the one to kill Dokja while also helping him with by both giving skill advice and stalling (and eventually landing the killing blow on) the enemy
85,"Dec 30, 2021",i'M gOiNg tO bE ThE OnE tO k¡lL yOU. Sounds fake but ok.
85,"Dec 29, 2021",you are my prey.. I won't let anything or anyone else to kill you.. where have you heard this before??
85,"Dec 29, 2021","They help each other 🤩🤩🤩 Also, they have another fable!!! Also the art is so pretty as always 🤩🤩😍😍❤️❤️"
85,"Dec 29, 2021","I'm sensing some real Goku and Vegeta vibes from these two. started as enemies, became rivals, eventually became allies and friends. I'm hopefuly that things go that well, anyways 😂"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",Nothing is stronger or more beautiful than a relationship that revolves around the phrase: “only I am allowed to kill you” 
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Happy new year 
85,"Feb 2, 2022","i like how dokja keeps getting into situations where he almost dies and then junghyeok is here like ""bruh stop almost dying i'll be the one to kill you, you understand?"" 💀"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",can't... stop... shipping......
85,"Jan 30, 2022",My shipping of Junghyeok and Dokja intensifies with every chapter.
85,"Dec 29, 2021","Oh, I'm finished, well time to go into a coma for the next week."
85,"Dec 31, 2021",you can tell that dokja is winning junghyeok's heart 🤸‍♀️🫀
85,"Dec 31, 2021","So it’s almost like his fourth wall skill prevented him in a way from learning the wind skill, so that’s why he couldn’t master it cuz to him it was still a quote from a story and it finally clicked when the fourth wall diminished 👏👏😩 not my favourite series for nothing"
85,"Dec 29, 2021",I think that fable creation was what Dokja had been aiming for this whole time 🤩
85,"Dec 29, 2021","That debuff to the Fourth Wall is a little concerning. Sounds like he's starting to become more like a character, which means eventually he might lose Fourth Wall"
85,"Feb 2, 2022","""I'm going to be the one to kill you"". Is he ""claiming"" Dokja for himself?? 👀👀👀👀👀"
85,"Jan 1, 2022","""I'll be the one to kill you"" Sounds suspicious that's usually how every male lead tells the female lead but in this case the other male lead."
85,"Jan 13, 2022"," I liked how the authors kept some of his teenage like features. He liked to read comics, where the girls always fall the mc. He was mad that Sangah and Sooyoung didn’t act like the girls in the comics. Him being pissed off, shows that he was childish enough to believe he can get girls like mc’s do just by existing. Expect he was a teenager for a long ass time soo he grew into a broader line incel."
85,"Dec 30, 2021","He protecc, he attacc, he give mana bacc"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",yjh x kdj and hsy x ysa and jhw x lhs and ljy x knw. yes? agree? 
85,"Dec 29, 2021",I kind of feel sorry for that narcissistic delusional weirdo...just a little bit
85,"Feb 2, 2022","""I'm going to be the one to kill you"" That's so romantic."
85,"Feb 2, 2022","I kinda feel sad for Ilsang..Afterall he was just a innocent kid who wanted to become hero and save the world.But the system tricked him to spend hundreds of years in other dimension alone , forced to fight for survival ,isolated from his home ,family and at last became villian  of the planet that he wanted to be hero of.."
85,"Feb 2, 2022","aww they changed one of my favorite lines ""'Kim dokja don't think about it. they wouldn't care if you died' 'there are people like that' but not everyone was like that"" I think it's better like this than the version in the webtoon right now..."
85,"Jan 12, 2022","Junghyeok: *living his life, doing something, minding his business, cooking food, literally anything else* Dokja: He's going to Kill Me!!! *visible Screaming*"
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Dokja can't even complain about him killing him lol
85,"Feb 2, 2022",That was a surprisingly bitter ending… But hey Dokja getting super op is a win 
85,"Jan 2, 2022",Yoo junghyuk saying he’d be the one killing Kim dokja… a bit ironic isn’t it ifykyk
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Thanks Webtoon for calling the castratophe a returnee. It's great to see the comments of the last chapters be usefull :) 
85,"Feb 2, 2022",I can't help but think how lonely the 4th wall skill is. It's like it's seperating Dokja from the world. Not to mention that it weakens whenever he thinks the scenarios as real and not just some part of the novel. It's like he isn't there or he shouldn't be there... or I'm just overthinking things
85,"Feb 2, 2022",Bruh at this point dokja and junghyeok are gonna be like partners in crime
85,"Jan 3, 2022",are you sure you'll kill dokja? 🤔
85,"Feb 2, 2022",Junghyeok just goes tsundere mode
85,"Dec 30, 2021","Tsundere Junghyeok ""I'll be the one to kill you"" LIKE... REALLY!😂😂😂"
85,"Feb 2, 2022","""I'll be the one to kill you"" ahhhhh i just love enemies to lovers trope 🤪"
85,"Feb 2, 2022","Joonghyuk's explanation was a bit more detailed than that, he said to let all the wind outside, leaving nothing within. But it's still fine"
85,"Dec 29, 2021","I love the developing Dokja/Junghyeok dynamic, it's so good. 🥰"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",I love the ever evolving relationship those two have. And admittedly after reading the novel some of the translations make way for plenty of uh- *cough* unwholesome *cough* thoughts
85,"Feb 2, 2022",First of all Uriel why did you not give them anything when Junghyeok said that
85,"Feb 2, 2022",do y’all think dokja ever wrote twsa fanfiction
85,"Jan 15, 2022",I feel a little bad that the kid ended up that way
85,"Feb 2, 2022",bros being gay😮‍💨
85,"Feb 2, 2022",I m enjoying the bromance between Dokja and janghyuk..... 
85,"Feb 2, 2022",damn ive reached the end of the free episodes.... time to go back to the cruel reality of work and responsibilities
85,"Feb 2, 2022",I think that this story is just incredible in the way that it is written. I am in it all. To take so many amazing capabilities… awe just awe
85,"Feb 2, 2022","let's start collecting those fables, yeah? 👀"
85,"Jan 28, 2022","Is that how you say ""I love you, don't die yet"", Junghyeok??????????"
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Dokja is such a good person. That’s all. 
85,"Feb 2, 2022","THE HEIGHT DIFFERENCE, DOKJA'S LOOKING UP WHILE JOONGHYUK'S LOOKING DOWN AT HIM"
85,"Feb 3, 2022","It doesn’t feel like an achievement… it just feels sad, he was just a kid but the fable name sounds lit "
85,"Feb 2, 2022",Natsumi_i I think there might be ORV side stories being planned??? There's a post on it on reddit.
85,"Feb 2, 2022","What an amazing chapter. The art style, the struggle, the realisations. Beautiful. "
85,"Feb 2, 2022","He earned another fable, does this mean that he's really walking on the path of being a constellation himself?"
85,"Feb 2, 2022","First we have The King of The World Without a King, and now we got The One Who Fought Against a Miracle."
85,"Feb 2, 2022",this episode and all the interacrions between dokja & junghyeok 🤧😌
85,"Dec 29, 2021",That cloth of his was getting dangerously close to revealing something 😳
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Dokja used “way of the wind”. It’s super effective.
85,"Feb 2, 2022",Listen I don't want to be the usual cliche fan that always needs to find something gay to ship.....BUT LISTEN...
85,"Feb 4, 2022","I noticed this on twitter but did anyone see that Dokja’s right buckle was not attached, then got reattached after Junghyeok gave him mana? Conclusion: Junghyeok adjusted Dokja’s clothes while healing him, what a loving and supportive boyfriend 🥰"
85,"Feb 4, 2022","""I will be the one to kill you"" that is the most romantic thing ive ever seen junghyeok say /j "
85,"Feb 2, 2022",“I will kill you if you ask any questions.” *Proceeds to kill him anyways*
85,"Feb 2, 2022",For some reason I pity Ilsang Myeong. Dokja is right...
85,"Feb 2, 2022",he can step on me too 
85,"Feb 2, 2022",“I’m the one who gets to kill you.” That was pretty cute tbh. Looking forward to this bromance 
85,"Feb 2, 2022",Killstealer. 
85,"Feb 2, 2022",YJH transfer his mana to KDJ what a sweet moment
85,"Jan 26, 2022","""I'm going to be the one to kill you""i can't hold my inner fangirl anymore at this point :))"
85,"Jan 13, 2022","""only I get to kill you"" dynamics always get me like 😩👌 the flavor~✨"
85,"Dec 30, 2021","""you either die a hero, or you live long enough to become the villian"""
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Very happy that the translators corrected the verbiage for  Ilsang Myeong from “regressor” to “returnee”!!! 😊 it’s an important distinction later on
85,"Mar 9, 2022","""I'm going to be the one to kill you"", said Yu Junghyeok while giving the person he ""hates"" mana."
85,"Mar 2, 2022","""I'm going to be the one to kill you."" is that a love language"
85,"Feb 5, 2022",Junghyeok supporting Dokja was really cool but it was funny when Dokja first thought he was there to beat him up🤣🤣
85,"Feb 4, 2022","keep forgetting these 2 aren't canon dating, been reading to much fanfiction i guess"
85,"Feb 2, 2022","I'm on my periods, my stomach is aching like hell, my brain is not working and this chapter is fire so I felt the need to leave a comment : ) "
85,"Feb 2, 2022",These two fighting together 🔥🔥🔥
85,"Feb 2, 2022","This chapter was *chefs kiss* awesome! The art is astonishing, every time a new episode is out I smile knowing how great this story is"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",AAAAHHH JOOONDOK I love you TT they’re perfect TT where is Uriel she needs to see this
85,"Feb 2, 2022","""You have to guide it gently"" 😏 How gentle are we talking about here..Mr. Joonghyuk?"
85,"Jan 12, 2022",Really crazy that the world he sees is so distant from that of being a character. When to us he is the main character 
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Damn! Worth all of the extra coins I had to pay to get this far!
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Dokja was bout to swing at that MF in the last panel
85,"Feb 2, 2022",enemies to lovers? I see it 
85,"Feb 6, 2022",The fact that i read all 84 episodes in two days is a bit concerning to me 
85,"Feb 4, 2022","The constellation, BrokeSupporter, would like to sponsor some coins but he currently has none,"
85,"Feb 4, 2022",missing sang ah hours
85,"Feb 4, 2022","I was wondering what would come first, the old rag slipping down his waist or he diying. Guess second one 🤷🏻‍♀️."
85,"Feb 4, 2022","I'll remember to never answer any questions of a half naked man that just came out from a big rock, and just to make sure, I'll just never answer any questions from a half naked man. "
85,"Feb 3, 2022","notice how at the end it said ""personal skill, way of the wind level 8, deavtivated"" where before it said skill of the Prince of imyuntar showing that now it iz truly dokja's skill"
85,"Feb 3, 2022",this webtoon is so sexy
85,"Feb 3, 2022",dokja looks so damn fine in his suit omg especially all bloodied up.. gawdamn...
85,"Feb 3, 2022",I'm crying guys as a person who read whole novel about dokja and JUK and right now seeing their first fable which they obtained together and how they becoming friends it's smth from another world
85,"Feb 3, 2022","""I'll be the one to kill you."" am i the only one abnormal here? instead of getting scared i now ship these two 😭🥲"
85,"Feb 3, 2022",What about Sangah and the plagiarist? Both Dokja and Jungyeok would have probably died without them. 
85,"Feb 2, 2022","junghyeok: i'm going to be the one to kill you.jongdok shippers: OMFG SHIP!!
(but let's be honest
junghyeok is already attached to dokja)"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",yesss dokja deadass became an airbender
85,"Feb 2, 2022","that last panel tho, .... why do i feel like the plagiarizer girl is gonna hit him (in the u know what) and ask why she didn't get an achieve for helping out."
85,"Feb 2, 2022",'You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.'

85,"Feb 2, 2022","This chapter met all my expectations. 🔥 I feel bad for the returnee, but the show must go on. New Stigma here we come!"
85,"Feb 2, 2022","The fourth wall thinned a bit, I worry that when it goes away that he'll just fade into the story like the others.
but when it disappears it might also mean he's become the true main character of the story and gets a power boost.
"
85,"Feb 2, 2022","Ok, it's kinda unrelated to the main plot, but I've been asking myself this for a while now...HOW DOES NO GUY IN THIS HAVE ANY SIGNS OF FACIAL HAIR? Our MAIN characters most certainly don't have the time to shave at all, let alone every 3-4 days now. I mean, even the catastrophe of questions has hair grown out till below his waist, but where da long-ass beard at? Like speaking from watching my dad, brothers and male friends during the lockdown, Idk. But no criticism tho, this is my favourite WT!"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",i know this is a bit inappropriate but also it isn't (lol) but i have to say it: STEP ON ME SIR! 🤣
85,"Feb 2, 2022",I love that the characters have their own standpoints..I love the dynamics..I love our protagonists

85,"Feb 2, 2022",this webtoon never stops delivering 
85,"Feb 2, 2022",He became the last sir bender.

Ah, Junghyeok is a man of culture I see XD."

*holds back spoilers with all my might* HE WONT I PROMISE (;⊙;_;☉;)"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",A fable?? What does that mean??
85,"Feb 2, 2022",kind of glad he's dead. he was weird in a creepy way. plus I didn't want to change my name...
85,"Feb 2, 2022","Dang, vacuum is cool"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",i think the because he thinks of himself as a reader it is holding him back from revealing his attributes
85,"Feb 2, 2022","Kim Dokja: Do you think Jonghyuk likes me? //Han Sooyoung: What do you mean? You're literally lying on his shoulder in his lap //
Kim Dokja: But does he like me? //
Yoo Jonghyuk: I don't."
85,"Feb 2, 2022","Dokja and Junghyeok act like brothers, like ""I'm going to kill you, but I'm the only person who's allowed to."" "
85,"Feb 2, 2022",2 wounded hotties..what a way to live. I can now die in peacefully...NO I HAVE TO LIVE FOR THEM

85,"Feb 2, 2022",i thought the leaves were black feathers and omg when i tell you i panicked (this is coming from a person who has read the novel)
85,"Jan 1, 2022",Dokja and Junghyeok working together? Never thought I'd see the day.
85,"Dec 31, 2021",The official drip is coming!!
85,"Dec 30, 2021",Ilsang was expecting to become Naofumi but got betrayed by the Star stream. Man i feel kinda bad for him. 
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Dokja & Junghyeok=Besto Friendo
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Longest weeks of my life man
85,"Dec 29, 2021",that felt way too short. awesome but short.
85,"Feb 2, 2022",I'm beginning to understand dokja and junghyeok as characters also I previously believed dokja to be the author but now I think Suyeong might actually be the real author and dokja might actually be something else entirely besides a read idk what yet but he is clearly something unnatural even to constellations by the way he interacts with the olympian ones also I'm beginning to question if this is even junghyeok 3rd regression because of the number of changes dokja has mentioned most he caused
85,"Jul 31, 2022","""I will be the one to kill you."" Is it just me or does that sound like he is confessing and that in reality they will both be the deaths of each other?? 🤣😌❤️"
85,"Jul 13, 2022","if this isn't confession then what is this ""I'll be the one to kill you"" "
85,"Jul 10, 2022",omg the main character and the main character defeated the main character 
85,"Jun 23, 2022",the scenes of kim dokja and junghyeok are just straight as a 🌈rainbow
85,"Apr 25, 2022",This is a Yaoi webtoon at this point it’s just instead of I love you it’s I will kill you 
85,"Apr 3, 2022","""I'm going to be the one to kill you."" is the new I love you. 🥰 "
85,"Apr 1, 2022","The "" i have to be the one who kills you"" was love words to me"
85,"Mar 5, 2022",Noone:Dokja about ro die 💀👀Junhhyeok:Im supposed to be the first person to kill Dokja bish *intense deathstare* 👀
85,"Mar 4, 2022","can i just curse, FCK THIS IS SO COOLLLLLLL IT HYPING ME UP MAHN I JUST WISH IA CAN TELL THE AUTHOR THE ONE WHO DRAW THIS THAT THIS IS EPIC"
85,"Feb 9, 2022",*still wondering where wolf boi guide is *
85,"Feb 9, 2022",I wonder How much of the original story has been derailed???? 😅
85,"Feb 8, 2022",im just here praying that there might be a BL miracle
85,"Feb 8, 2022",i just started reading this and binged it for like 4 hours from start to finish. i have school in an hour
85,"Feb 8, 2022",I like that Dokja can understand with the people he fights. Great chapter
85,"Feb 8, 2022",Wow. Ive been bing reading Omniscient Reader since the last 2 days and I can't wait to follow this serie. It is a beautiful one
85,"Feb 7, 2022",The most romantic line that Junghyeok said: I'll be the one to kill you
85,"Feb 5, 2022",we really be getting fan service with our ship sailing like this... bless the author 
85,"Feb 5, 2022",Junghyeok lowkey concern or more likely helping Dokja.
85,"Feb 4, 2022",i want this opening panel so bad a wallpaper. 😭 it looks so sick. 
85,"Feb 4, 2022",dokja be a walking fable generator
85,"Feb 4, 2022","Haha, that gal seems enthusiastic with reading, I pray they suffer the wrath of this hellish reality."
85,"Feb 4, 2022",Dokja really is getting a good grip on his abilities; now learning to become both character and reader to beat his opponents. Makes me wonder how stronger he’ll become if he continues using his powers like that. Though i do feel pity for the calamity of questions. He wanted to become an isekai protagonist only to end up being turned into a deranged calamity by the dokkabi. It was best the kid was put out of his misery before he caused anymore destruction.
85,"Feb 4, 2022",I found it funny how in the last panel Junghyeok Yu looks like he couldn't care less. So Dokja has to balance between being a reader and feeling like a character 🤔 sounds a bit difficult but it adds more complexity to the story 🤩 
85,"Feb 4, 2022",Look at their bromance. Hehe
85,"Feb 4, 2022",look. look. this has so much potential to be an anime
85,"Feb 3, 2022",I’m devastated by the fact that I caught up 😭😭😭😭
85,"Feb 3, 2022",can we all stop and appreciate the gorgeous art for a bit
85,"Feb 3, 2022",Ohhhhhh they’re getting nearer with the —————- scenario 👀
85,"Feb 3, 2022",Honestly the novel Is a Masterpiece 
85,"Feb 3, 2022","There's something so very sad about seeing this guy pass. Yes, he was a maniac, and not the good kind either...but he wasn't always like that. He USED to be so much better. A life snuffed out that held such a story is the tragedy here; the price we had to pay because the alternative was worse. But it doesn't make it any less sorrowful."
85,"Feb 3, 2022","""I'm going to be the one to kill you."" Okay, Junghyeok, I get what you are saying :))"
85,"Feb 3, 2022",i just absolutely adore this webtoon. it is by far the most imaginative and well written one. the characters all grow with each episode. i feel like i am a part of their world.
85,"Feb 3, 2022",The “A Reader’s Fight” title makes so much sense 
85,"Feb 3, 2022",Kim Dokja Company's first Fable 🤩 Let's go!!!
85,"Feb 3, 2022",this is the most badass enemies lovers I've ever read
85,"Feb 3, 2022",JHK's words to KD really It hits hard for novel readers *sobs*
85,"Feb 3, 2022",Junghyeok X dojka for lifeeeeee
85,"Feb 3, 2022",I read this comic in a day ..y’all what am I supposed to do now😭😭😭😭😀😀 I can’t wait for a whole other week 😭
85,"Feb 3, 2022","For anyone like myself that listens to music while reading comics, I recommend ‘Gorilla- Clams Casino’ for this episode"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",Yooo! This chapter was an insane conclusion to this catastrophe! Omniscient reader keeps bringing the awesomeness each chapter 👍🔥
85,"Feb 2, 2022","the tiny panel with their two faces after it said ""main contributors: dokja, junghyeok"" made me ship this power couple 😂"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",✨only junghyeok can kill dokja✨
85,"Feb 2, 2022","I'm ending this with quote before I sleep lmao, for all our comrades who commented to achieve our goals.."
85,"Feb 2, 2022","Woah, I thought we're not achieving it this week. But no, we're going on a streak!"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",I saw a number of people wishing Myung Ilsang joined their side..WHY DO YOU WANT SUCH A NARCISSISTIC AND ARROGANT MORON TO BE THEIR COMPANION
85,"Feb 2, 2022",Junghyeok Yu casually leaving after the battle.
85,"Feb 2, 2022",this series is honestly impressive. i really enjoy reading it
85,"Feb 2, 2022",Reading this chapter while listening to Hero by Skillet was another frigging world. GO DOKJA!!
85,"Feb 2, 2022","Ah, the top comments aren't reallyy...eh replyable lmao, that's not a word"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",i’ll just be eating on yoohankim crumbs😭 and also didnt expect him to save ppl bro (yjh) just fell in love at first sight🤭🤭
85,"Feb 2, 2022","The art is soo good. Also: YooHanKim, my beloved "
85,"Feb 2, 2022",there's a Vegeta/Goku bromance vibe between those two ... :D
85,"Feb 2, 2022","He believe the constellation (?) so wrong... He believes that he'll be the MC but it turns out to be the opposite, he became a villain. It might be good if Ilseong will be one of their companions tho :<"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",The system or his reader power just called him a main character!
85,"Feb 2, 2022",the art in this chapter was so cool!! looking forward to the next few eps especially 
85,"Feb 2, 2022",Junghyeok has really became kind to Dokja. 
85,"Feb 2, 2022",so much soukoku vibes!!
85,"Feb 2, 2022",but i really am curious what talent bloomed in dokja's spirit
85,"Feb 2, 2022","i wonder if the weakening of his fourth wall skill, essentially his slow transition from a reader to a character, is gonna be a boon or a bust to his abilities"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",I want to know about the talent that blossomed within Dokja
85,"Feb 2, 2022",New story huh..........
85,"Feb 2, 2022",YJH can step on me like that anyday
85,"Feb 2, 2022",I was so thrilled with the panel of Dokja running and carrying the words behind him
85,"Feb 2, 2022",I thought Dokja was on a no-killing thing? 
85,"Feb 2, 2022",I think if Dokja dies he'll become a constellation because he's getting fables about himself similar to how constellations work and with the way they are based off of stories or myths dokja is making his story whether he realizes or not
85,"Feb 2, 2022",I felt like he could of been an ally
85,"Feb 2, 2022",did the translations get better? it got better didn't it yahoo
85,"Feb 2, 2022","He transferred mana to Dokja,,,,👀👀👀👀👀"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",I love this webtoon it's so awsome 😁
85,"Feb 2, 2022",Dokja is so FINE for what
85,"Feb 2, 2022","and just like that the Immortal king, Dokja Kim created a new Fable that will echo throughout the stars, along with best frienemy forever Junkeock (butchered it didn't I?)"
85,"Jan 30, 2022","I'm going to admit, Dokja has to balance being the reader and being a character to survive."
85,"Dec 31, 2021",AAAAAAAA I'M SO PROUD OF THE BOTH OF THEM AAAA I LOVE THIS WEBCOMIC
85,"Dec 31, 2021","Wow, he obtained the possibility of a new stigma, interesting. And when he got how the characters felt in the story, his fourth wall became thin. Does that mean anything?"
85,"Dec 31, 2021",when u spend 500 coins on buying the most recent
85,"Dec 30, 2021","[the hidden talent whitin your spirt has blossomed] Dokja: see that I do have have talent, suck on that you damn plagiarist!. "
85,"Dec 29, 2021",When is dokja gonna realize he’s the real main character lol
85,"Feb 2, 2022","Maybe he looked like an innocent kid. But he seemed to enjoy being the protagonist and wanted an harem of waifus. Probably he consumed all those isekai animes while grinning like an idiot. He was arrogant and selfish, I can't say his death is sad for me. Definitely he was one of those ""boys will be boys"" kind of guy. So yeah...a bit disgusting"
85,"Sep 30, 2022","i know i shouldn’t, as junghyeok had a child in his previous regressions but…i can kind of see dokja and junghyeok as a thing i meannnn can you blame me? 😂🌈"
85,"Sep 29, 2022",All the Dokkaebi need to be eliminated. I have a feeling there is some Dokkaebi in charge manipulating events so that the Constellations remain unaware while they’re enjoying just enough content. The Dokkaebi are too bloodthirsty for their own good.
85,"Aug 31, 2022",BRO I LOVE THIS KIND OF POWERFUL DUO AND LOVE HARE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DOKJA AND JUNGHYEOK 🔥
85,"Aug 25, 2022","damn Junghyeok (๑♡⌓♡๑) ""I'll be the one to kill you"" ?? how romantic~~ lmao "
85,"Aug 17, 2022","CALM DOWN EVERYONE, JUNGHYEOK JUST USED THE ""I'LL BE THE ONE TO KILL YOU"" TROPE 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭"
85,"Jul 28, 2022","THE ""I'll be the one to kill you"" GOT ME BLUSING THEY ARE LIKE HUSBANDS FIGHTING ALWAYS BUT SWEET SOMETIMES😭"
85,"Jul 27, 2022",Did dokja just airbend?? suddenly Dokja became Aang the last airbender HAHAHAHHA 
85,"Jul 23, 2022",“I’ll be the one to kill you” I just heard a love confession🙄✋
85,"Jul 16, 2022",Fate is fucked up he was pure and kind but fate turned him into a monster and he died for it should I blame him or is it fate that should be blamed for how he ended
85,"Jul 10, 2022",The main character along with the main character of the novel defeat the guy who was supposed to be a main character 
85,"Jul 1, 2022",“You will die by MY hand” sounds so much cooler tho ._.
85,"Jun 29, 2022",To all the people who are sad about ilsang death.... guys ORV is supposed to make you feel like this and this is just the beginning 
85,"Jun 27, 2022","*starting to feel sympathetic towards the catastrophe**remembers that he wanted to come home as a ""hero"" and ""sleep with pretty women""*
*cringes and walks away*"
85,"Jun 26, 2022",dokja the last air reader 🥶
85,"Jun 26, 2022",the main character helped our main character to beat the man who want to be a main character 
85,"Jun 22, 2022",[The Constellation 'Unproductive Reader' is happy about the impromptu tag team]
85,"Apr 23, 2022",i love the dynamic of dokja and junghyuk 
85,"Apr 7, 2022","It's sad though. The catastrophe was an energetic, happy, kinda naïve kid who just wanted to be a hero. And yet he became the thing he hated, an antagonist. I wonder what happened in that world that turned him into this :("
85,"Apr 6, 2022","yjh rushed to help dokja again (w mana) and then brushed it off with “I’m going to be the one to k1ll you, not some other dude” damn I love their bond so much"
85,"Apr 6, 2022","yjh saying kdj is ""impressive"" I'm not going dyslexic am i?"
85,"Apr 3, 2022","Wait. Did yjh just complimented Dokja??? He said ""impressive""!!! OMG, an approval from the protagonist! Dokja, you did it!"
85,"Apr 3, 2022",“im going to be the one to kill you” im just gonna shush
85,"Apr 2, 2022",Junghyeok would be a great mentor...
85,"Mar 30, 2022",junghyeok: im the one who's going to kill ume: oh rlly?😏
85,"Mar 25, 2022",*ATLA THEME INTENSIFIES*
85,"Mar 18, 2022","everytime that kid's smiling face comes up before he became the catastrophe of questions, my heart breaks "
85,"Mar 16, 2022",im trying real hard not to ship them but dude after that one line junghyeok said 🥴🥴🥴
85,"Mar 10, 2022",my life and death companion 😭😭😭
85,"Mar 1, 2022","""I'm going to be the one to kill you."" Honey–"
85,"Feb 20, 2022",jungheyok complimenting dokja is smth I live for 
85,"Feb 10, 2022",nice air bending Dokja 💨 💨 💨 
85,"Feb 10, 2022",I looooove this story! I can't tell if I'm reading it or if it's reading me. 
85,"Feb 10, 2022",i kinda feel bad for ilsang.. and i hope junghyeok can learn a bit more compassion from dokja.. i like their teamwork tho 
85,"Feb 9, 2022",Sure yjh kill him after u helped him and transfered mana HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA SOBS we love a tsundere daddy
85,"Feb 9, 2022",it says u have the possibility to have a new stigma does that mean dokja will have some abilities of the catastrophe of questions
85,"Feb 9, 2022","40,000 coins though..."
85,"Feb 8, 2022",Thank you this was so amazing
85,"Feb 8, 2022",heh. 16 more hours? I CAN WAIT. 👁️ 👄 👁️
85,"Feb 8, 2022",supremacy for Dokja Kim 🙏🙏🙏🙏
85,"Feb 7, 2022","Only 40,000? that's scam ima need 100,000. Or they better give a nice item to go with the 40k.

If I was Dokja I would be beating the literal shit out of that 17 year old, ON GOD HE GOT ON MY NERVES. but he only got off with a stab? Naurrr. 
- that ends my comments on this episode."
85,"Feb 7, 2022",them two pretty bestfriends
85,"Feb 6, 2022",Finally done catching up to this webtoon and omg I'm so invested in thissss
85,"Feb 6, 2022",This is the first webtoon I have read and I am glad that it is great. 
85,"Feb 6, 2022",The ship is sailing yassssss
85,"Feb 6, 2022",Do I feel bad for Ilsang? Yes. Who would blame him for all hes went through?
85,"Feb 6, 2022",the art is so beautiful
85,"Feb 5, 2022","That last scene had me collapsing. Victory came in, but I can’t imagine how painful it is to feel physically because of the effects of the fight. "
85,"Feb 5, 2022",great battle excellent chapter.. the mini ark ends faster.. it should be like this.. thanks author
85,"Feb 5, 2022","i think dokja is living out the third part of the novel he used to read. its titled ""three ways to survive the apocalypse"" but so far we've only been shown two. what if the third path is to have a guidebook"
85,"Feb 5, 2022","with your powers combined, I am CAPTAIN PLANET!!!"
85,"Feb 5, 2022",The Dokja and Junghyeok collaboration was way too fking good!!! Hope there’s more and more from here on out
85,"Feb 4, 2022","dokja really be killing it...LIKE THE WIND!
(can anyone recognise the reference?)"
85,"Feb 4, 2022",I sure hope no one reads that atrocity 
85,"Feb 4, 2022",more! more! more!
85,"Feb 4, 2022",The best chapter yet that character development was fire 🔥 
85,"Feb 4, 2022","cough cough, ah yes, the 'im going to be the one to kill you' troupe, ofcourse"
85,"Feb 3, 2022",I love it so much it's just way too epic
85,"Feb 3, 2022","I've been thinking about this for a while: whenever the MC is viewed using Dokja's character profile, it summarizes the main character's information (too much info). it says regressor (3rd round).As it is a summary,and as Dokja seems to be the only one with that ability (so that ability wouldn't have been used on the main character in the novel),he may very well be misreading how many times MC has regressed.If that is considered, the MC having knowledge and abilities he shouldn't makes mo sense."
85,"Feb 3, 2022","is it just me or does that catastrophe guy look a lil like dokja. idk why but the possibility of him becoming a villain seems more real now, especially now since junghyeok said he would be the one to kill him with such certainty. "
85,"Feb 3, 2022","pogi talaga junghyeok, as always 🥰"
85,"Feb 3, 2022",One of my absolute favorite chapters yet!!
85,"Feb 3, 2022",This chapter was extra awesome. I’m so grateful to have been put on to this webtoon. I’ve been with you since your premiere. This story is incredible. 🙏🏼

85,"Feb 3, 2022",This chapter was a blast
85,"Feb 3, 2022","Dokja’s ability to understand and empathize with other people, even bad people, is his greatest strength. It’s just too good"

85,"Feb 2, 2022",My 3 comments left until the 1000th
85,"Feb 2, 2022","Damn, I was hoping we could keep him alive so that he could join Dokja's side... at least we got some beautiful pannels"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",this episode was so wholesome 🤩💕
85,"Feb 2, 2022","Sigh, I want to sleep. Forfeiting the mission to reach 1000 comments within a day."
85,"Feb 2, 2022","Wow, 70 comments left.."
85,"Feb 2, 2022",wait didn't dokjas ability stop him from being able to kill people? 
85,"Feb 2, 2022",man... so intense 
85,"Feb 2, 2022","Really want Sun Wukong to give Dokja his stigma. Because I know Dokja can't get a sponsor due to his contract, but I am really curious about what Wukong stigma is, because there are so many possibilites"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",JETT!? 
85,"Feb 2, 2022",Nice
85,"Feb 2, 2022",I'm definitely questioning webtoon's method of translation now..... (there aren't really any translation mistakes this chapter which are a big deal.....but yeah translating 'Nobody would care if you died' into 'Their lives aren't worth saving' is sooo weird to me.)
85,"Feb 2, 2022",ahh - and now marks the first story he creates
85,"Feb 2, 2022",wow this ep is just *chef's kiss*
85,"Feb 2, 2022",“I’ll be the one to kill you.” ummmmmmm
85,"Feb 2, 2022",Best chapter yet I was screaming internally the whole time 
85,"Feb 2, 2022",the highlight of this chapter is dokja naruto running!
85,"Feb 2, 2022",😌🍵Haaa~Perfect~
85,"Feb 2, 2022","Nooooo I finished binging the episodes I let pile up 😭 time to reread the light novel i guess,,,"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",dang this was beautiful 
85,"Feb 2, 2022",It's episodes like these why I truly enjoy reading this webtoon. 
85,"Feb 2, 2022",day 7.....
85,"Feb 2, 2022","At last, his journey to 5 Stories has begun... Shoutout to the readers of ORV who understand what I'm sayin'"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",it's finally rolling around!! I'm not going to spoil it but its gonna get good!!
85,"Feb 2, 2022",I think Dokja the author and just doesn't know it
85,"Feb 2, 2022",a bit sad...
85,"Feb 2, 2022",That was probably the most epicest moment of his life
85,"Feb 2, 2022",HEHEHHE HES SOMEHOW EVEN MORE RICH 🤑
85,"Feb 2, 2022",Islang myeong deserves his own spin off ❤️. I'd like to know how all this came to be 
85,"Feb 2, 2022",did dokja do the same thing as ya from the boxer where they just decide to gain talent lol.
85,"Feb 2, 2022",The fact that he has understanding of the Catastrophe of Questions should be worrying. That means he can Bookmark him.
85,"Feb 2, 2022",what chapter in the novel is this?
85,"Feb 2, 2022",when your actions and words are different 👀
85,"Feb 2, 2022",I wonder if dokja will be able to control fourth wall later ??
85,"Feb 2, 2022","HIS 2ND FABLE IS HERE OMGOMGOMG THE WAY I SCREAMED DESPITE OF KNOWING SKOAKAKA,W"
85,"Feb 2, 2022","So- Dokja, thanks to his power, is a ""jack of all trades"" as the saying goes: “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.”"
85,"Feb 2, 2022",Dokja straight up became a constellation and doesn't even know it. he's permanently a part of this even if he successfully survives to the end he becomes like the other constellations
85,"Feb 2, 2022","""I'll be the one to kill you"" I didn't know  Vegeta was here. "
85,"Feb 2, 2022","Damn, this whole arch was really intense "

85,"Feb 2, 2022","Ah~ to be stabbed by Yoo Joonghyuk's sword. How does it feel to live my dream, Catastrophe of Questions? *pointing mic to dead man*"

85,"Feb 2, 2022",After all my step on me comments last chapter..once again STEP ON ME YOO JOONGHYUK 
85,"Feb 2, 2022",ok boyfriends!!
85,"Feb 2, 2022",Epic!!!
85,"Jan 28, 2022","I feel like Junghyeok sees his past self in Dokja. Junghyeok probably realized a few regressions ago that even though he was strong, saving everyone wasn't possible and gave up while Dokja with his newly acquired power feels responsible for others lives. Junghyeok's ideology right now seems to be kill before it's too late."
85,"Jan 28, 2022",10/10 smh made me use coins again 😭
85,"Jan 27, 2022",I think the author was Sanga
85,"Jan 27, 2022",THE TEAM WE’VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR IS FINALLY HERE
85,"Jan 23, 2022","Wow Dokja got two fables now, and that msg at the end,m [You have got the possibility of a new stigma]. What does that mean..."
85,"Jan 3, 2022",SSSSS-Grade story 👌🏻
85,"Dec 31, 2021","I read ""Fornification"" instead of ""Fortification"" 💀💀💀"
85,"Dec 31, 2021",[The Constellion who knows all but tells nothing is satisfied]
85,"Dec 30, 2021",This is so beautiful and terrifying all in one. Best chapter so far.
85,"Dec 30, 2021","Might more coins be spent towards those who create, my wallet seems to be getting lighter though. hmpf its probably nothin"
85,"Dec 30, 2021",Does this mean that the white coat coming soon?
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Junghyeok taking that “just killed someone” stroll at the end 🚶 
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Iconic
85,"Dec 29, 2021",Some real read-based gameplay right here
85,"Dec 29, 2021",that was incredible. what a wholesome friendship they have. 
85,"Mar 9, 2022",anyone else distracted by dokja's snatched af waist?
85,"Feb 2, 2022",Oh the good Fable. Things gonna be messy xD
85,"Sep 28, 2022","look at us, watching Dokja become a ............ himself!"
85,"Sep 5, 2022",Is no one going to talk about that JUK came to help Dokja even though he is not done recovering when Dokja was thinking he needed it and gives him mana like are y’all gay and yes this is coming from someone who is gay so what’s with that.😏
85,"Aug 24, 2022",Moral of the story Dokja and Cale is the same person same suicidal character 
85,"Aug 10, 2022",I want dokja to see characters as humans as well so he can emotionally connect to them and be happy but I dont want a powerful skill like the fourth wall to disappear.
85,"Aug 8, 2022",well... now the fourth wall's effect gets thinner as he thinks this world as real.  I'm just worried about further 
85,"Aug 8, 2022",I can't help but feel sorry for Miyeong😕
85,"Aug 6, 2022",84
85,"Aug 4, 2022",i love junghyeok and dokja's relationship so much 🧎
85,"Aug 3, 2022","A reader who became part of it, that's amazing "
85,"Aug 2, 2022",I truly should comment about the wonderful plot or wonderful art. But I just wants to say that I ship it.
85,"Jul 31, 2022",no one is going to comment how Junghyeok just calmly walks away after stabbing the person in the back. even after all he goes threw he still tries to act cool and leave as though nothing happened. and I thought it was cute that Sooyoung ran to Dokja at the end. 🤣
85,"Jul 30, 2022",Uhuh sure Junghyeok 
85,"Jul 27, 2022",lmao Soyoung looks so tiny 
85,"Jul 22, 2022",I hope it gave him karma point for that action
85,"Jul 21, 2022","i was wondering about how drastically different dokja’s moral compass is from the first scenario to the current one but i guess it’s bc he saw the world as fiction or from the viewpoint of a reader in the first scenario so there’s no attachment or empathy on taking people’s lives, but as the story progresses he becomes more and more immersed in the world ultimately thinning the fourth wall and seeing the story from the lens of a ‘character’."
85,"Jul 14, 2022",Incredible chapter 💯
85,"Jul 10, 2022",He got Aerith'd (from Final Fantasy 7)
85,"Jul 7, 2022","I think he actually wishes he could be the protagonist. I mean he got mad because dude tried to tell him those people's lives didn't matter and only defeating the catastrophe did but what about when he let so many die when he chose not to kill parasitic poison chick. he said why does he have any power to choose who lives and dies but he does make that decision. junghyeok was supposed to defeat the catastrophe but he took it upon himself to the protection amulet thing, knowing it could not be"
85,"Jun 11, 2022",everything about this chapter is amazing omg
85,"Jun 9, 2022","Why you taking so long dude?  Guess i have to kill him myself ""stab"" "
85,"Jun 9, 2022","That Should have filled his King of no death meter, So Junghyeok, do what you got to do."
85,"May 26, 2022",Yu Jonghyuk is so handsome .. 😍😍😍
85,"May 12, 2022","""i'm going to be the one to kill you"" -linyahan ng mga taong gusto sila makapatay sa tao pero gusto talaga iligtas yung tao HAHAHAHA don't me. charot"
85,"May 11, 2022","aaWW it's the classic ""no one can kill you but me"" moment"
85,"May 5, 2022","poor kid was dupped to destroy another species world, only to die upon returning.. 😔"
85,"May 5, 2022",Dokja be like Korra finally learning airbending in the last ep of book 1
85,"Apr 23, 2022",tbh i feel kinda bad for that boy ): but i already knew he would end up dead
85,"Apr 8, 2022",Last chapter made it seem like Ilsang transported to another dimension to destroy Chronos but this one confirms he was meant to be its Hero. Wonder if he messed up cuz he was the only human amongst beast folk. What a sad end for him. He clearly became delusional. 
85,"Apr 8, 2022",17yrs old Ilsang myeong kinda look like dokja👍
85,"Mar 31, 2022",Am I really sad about his death? 😭
85,"Mar 23, 2022","is there a different story of this question monster, i would love to know what he went through that made him like this"
85,"Mar 21, 2022","The way I keep seeing the likes and comments getting less numbers as we progress in the story, makes me think we're reading TWSA and the number of renouncers keeps growing. I'm too invested in this"
85,"Mar 18, 2022","In OMV, They don't say 'I Love You,' They say 'I will be the one to kill you'. 
Joking aside, this chapter really gives perspective on what kind of a person/protagonist Junghyeok is."
85,"Mar 14, 2022","Honestly poor dude, he's just a 17 year old who got isekai'd into a villain"
85,"Mar 12, 2022",✨Satisfying✨
85,"Mar 9, 2022"," ""remove the matter surrounding him"" junghyeok brings out the best in dokja"
85,"Mar 9, 2022","almost forgot about the king of no killing thing, dokja can't kill anyone the first few arcs"

85,"Feb 23, 2022",I would like to put this here before I continue on. I wanna say that the one Dokja can not trust is Sangah… I said what I said.

85,"Apr 12, 2022",Poor kid. Might've become a catastrophe but he was just someone who got manipulated

85,"Mar 25, 2022","Hmm, I feel like his understanding should have grew exponential especially after feeling what it was like to be a character early in the episode. But then again it would be op to open a bookmark of a level 99"

85,"Feb 16, 2022","dokja's writing is so inconsistent, the author just gave up at ths point. like, since when does he worry about the well-being of random strangers? oh and he's apparently appalled by killing now"
85,"Mar 25, 2022","I kinda hate Dokja here, why would he think that Juk went down to beat him? bruhh, he wanted to beat but with the world's at ends, is that even necessary? it's just stupid that he monologue that, ughhhh"

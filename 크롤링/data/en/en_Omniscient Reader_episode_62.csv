3. awww gilyoung is my forever kid (but it's almost eerie how he perceives the whole situation so calmly - he doesn't even have any fourth wall)
4. I love that ORV has such long n lengthy chapters n so much happens almost every episode "
62,"Aug 25, 2021",KDJ saying he is mentally stable✨🗿 Gilyeong making killing sound like a trip to McDonald's 😭😭✋
62,"Aug 26, 2021",anyone else notice the likes slowly going down after each upload. it's unfathomable that people could give up on this series but in a little way reminds me of a much slower version of the story. maim character being the last one to read the whole series whilst the rest slowly stopped reading. I wonder how many will last the test of time 
62,"Aug 25, 2021",ARE THOSE PEOPLE THEYRE ROASTING???
62,"Aug 25, 2021",leaving the battles aside get our boy dokja some clothes

62,"Aug 25, 2021","For novel readers: Okay, so in the next few chapters I know a lot of us will be excited about HSY, but please avoid spoilers or even hyping them up too much... Someone could even create a comment where the novel readers can talk in the replies."
62,"Aug 25, 2021","KDJ: ""I am rather mentally stable""
AND YOU ARE A FUCKING LIAR AS WELL so like, how do we go from here Kim ""I am rather mentally stable"" Dokja? "
62,"Aug 25, 2021","Ahhhh!I love how from the beginning Dokja is so stubborn and contentious with the constellations, he really comes to put them in their place.
On the other hand, boy did Gilyeon accept the new reality, I remember reading that he had such a hard ""real life"" that he happily accepted the barbarities of the new world. I can't wait to see him open up emotionally with his hyung and that little person who is yet to join the team."
62,"Aug 28, 2021",bro just pushed a strong constellation out of himself with just willpower 0_0
62,"Aug 25, 2021","Gilyeong: Let's kill some Kings, momma didn't raise no wimp!!! "
62,"Aug 25, 2021",The way that Sangah and Gilyeong looked at each other lmaooo
62,"Aug 25, 2021","I feel like I have to point something impresive, acording to the web novel, dokja didnt disconect the constelation with the fourth wall, the wall tried to eat him so the constelation scaped really afraid, wich I think is hilarius"
62,"Jul 21, 2021",This comic gives me goosebumps in a good way
62,"Aug 25, 2021",PFT THE LOOK ON SANGAH’S FACE WHEN GILYEONG SAID THAT
62,"Aug 25, 2021",Gilyeong’s having a homicidal phase
62,"Aug 25, 2021",no comments about Miss Beauty King being jealous of Sangha 😏
62,"Aug 15, 2021",Me trying to read everything written on the 4th Wall 
62,"Jul 21, 2021","""constellation [Dragon of the Peach Tree] is intrigued by Gilyeong's loyalty to Dokja.  the constellation cheers and Rewards 5 coins"""
62,"Jul 21, 2021",just wanna say that this web tool is so dope yall
62,"Sep 2, 2021",“I guess we have to kill them.🤷‍♂️”🤣 I LOVE HOW GILYOUNG SAYS THAT SO CASUALLY 
62,"Aug 29, 2021","Fourth Wall is fuckin OP, absolute mental defence. Can it cure headaches too? "
62,"Aug 25, 2021",I've loved Gilyeong since the absolute beginning 
62,"Aug 25, 2021","So I found myself getting not excited only for the webtoon itself, but for the “LazyBrokeWeeb” constellation’s comments as well"
62,"Aug 25, 2021",Dokja just yeeted the constellation out of his body 
62,"Aug 25, 2021",metally stable? lmao yea right
62,"Aug 25, 2021","This kid fr is worthy to hold Thor's hammer, but gives no shits about killing and I love it. Honestly he's the best out of the group other than Dokja because even though he's a kid he's pretty mentally mature and doesn't sugarcoat things, he's also fairly well in touch with reality and realizes that you can't always spare/save everyone because it isn't always possible and may put you in danger. Love him "
62,"Aug 25, 2021",only sangah-sii has common sense in this house... 😂
62,"Jul 21, 2021","When the General's Constellation said he didn't have an ""Heir"", I thought that he meant Dokja was a Constellation as well, and hadn't picked an Incarnation yet x.x but he meant Dokja didn't have a child 😅 I thought this was some huge reveal this week"
62,"Aug 25, 2021","I’m genuinely worried about Gilyeong’s mental health, he shouldn’t be so nonchalant about killing"
62,"Aug 29, 2021",the silence between sang-ah and gilyeong LMFAO
62,"Aug 27, 2021",Dojka is like a speedrunner of a game that he’s played through dozens of times and come up with all these insane strategies to just be extremely OP
62,"Aug 26, 2021","me : gilyeoung is pure, gilyeoung: *suggests murder*, me : gilyeong is.. pure"
62,"Aug 25, 2021",Lmao Gilyeong you sweet summer child 😂
62,"Aug 25, 2021","I feel bad for Min Jiwon. The guy she had a crush on and the guy she likes now, are both having some serious bromance with each other. "
62,"Aug 25, 2021","Here we have a family: Dokja as the dad, Sangah as the mom and Gilyeong is their cute little son who thinks murdering people is normal- 😭😭😂😂😫✋"

62,"Jul 21, 2021","Oof that dungeon would be terrible for ppl who have automatonophobia. It does amuse me that it looks like the 3 are on some type of post-apocalyptic field trip. Gilyoung is very astute when it comes to his hyung. Sangah's reaction to that was hilarious, but understandable. She still needs a bit more to come to accept how the world has become now. Also, Sun Wukong always coming thru as one of my favorite constellations"
62,"Aug 26, 2021",99 acupuncture copper men on the wall . . .
62,"Aug 25, 2021","King of no killing (immortal king) is the ability dokja have to resurrect, but he needs to avoid killing in order to use it. If he killed someone he will lose this ability"
62,"Aug 25, 2021","lol imagine it, a kid chosen over 2 grown adults, poor them"
62,"Aug 11, 2021","Dokja refusing a God like a God himself, he the damn boss. And it's funny how cute Gilyeong is despite his nature. I love that kid. "
62,"Sep 29, 2021",I love how Gilyeong just looks so serious with his hammer. like he's about to play the most intense game of wack a mole
62,"Sep 25, 2021",I wonder if Dokja is more convinced now that he knows people around him are essentially characters. Jealous Jiwon is my new favorite thing 😘 Sangah is quick on her feet and very likeable. Meanwhile Gilyeong is very accepting of his new world and will kill for Dokja. Things are getting spicy with the constellations especially since Dokja had to flex the 4th wall
62,"Aug 30, 2021",uhm.. well.. that was a warm welcome.
62,"Aug 26, 2021","Gilyoung, as always, is ready to cut a bitch if the situation calls for it, good for him"
62,"Aug 26, 2021",Dokja forcing a constellation out of his body with his ability alone was awesome 👍🔥🔥
62,"Aug 25, 2021","I swear Gilyeong doesn't act his age when he's in a battle, he ain't playing around for sure"
62,"Aug 25, 2021",Sangah's and Dokja's relationship is so sweet
62,"Aug 25, 2021",I want more of murder child.

62,"Aug 28, 2021",This kid is bloodthirsty
62,"Jul 25, 2021",Nobody enters dokja without his permission.
62,"Jul 21, 2021","Nice strategy there Dokja: let them fight it out, that way you not only have to fight fewer people, but you’ll also be at an advantage with better health & higher energy than the rest of them. Not bad indeed."
62,"Aug 29, 2021",can we please have an easter egg for the constellation [the lazy broke weeb] for the persons dedication to this series and his running joke
62,"Aug 25, 2021",yall .. I just finished all 551 chapters of the ORV LN. I'm- reading this n watching Dokja and his companions go through this again is making me emotional 😭😭💜💜
62,"Jul 21, 2021",The author’s history of Korea and China is coming in handy. 
62,"Oct 9, 2021",bro fourth wall is seriously over powered
62,"Sep 8, 2021","gilyeong is casually going ""don't worry bout it"" about killing people, the coolness of this kid is unreal xDD he'd be such a cool MC too seriously. spin off with him as new MC please xD"
62,"Sep 4, 2021",I have a feeling that The Prisoner of The Golden Headband and Dokja would be great friends.
62,"Sep 2, 2021","Well, I aM rAtHeR MeNtALLy sTabLe 😂😂😂"
62,"Aug 30, 2021","I have just binge read through all of this, and honestly this has been thrilling to read from start to finish, I love it no joke. so excited to see where it's heading."
62,"Aug 28, 2021","gilyeong my boy be out here giving no shits about killing just for dokja, he knew what he had to do since day 1😭✋ just don't go on dying on me son 😩"
62,"Aug 26, 2021","as amazing as the story is, I'm living for the lazy broke weeb comments every time 🤣"
62,"Aug 25, 2021",Gilyeong: I guess we’ll have to kill them.Me: oooh my poor baby has been through so much ❤️❤️❤️
62,"Aug 25, 2021","Is it wrong that I find Gilyeong just talking about killing with 0 crap, amusing and fun?"
62,"Aug 25, 2021",honestly seeing lazy broke Weeb and his comments honestly make up the whole thing. I get a good laugh every time.

62,"Jul 21, 2021","""Well... I'm rather mentall stable."" wow dokja casual flex much?"

62,"Aug 26, 2021",When Dokja said he’s mentally stable…. I know a lot of people who wished they could be mentally stable
62,"Aug 26, 2021","[The Constellation ""Lo-Fi Princess"" is excited to have caught up on the story so far] [The Constellation ""Lo-Fi Princess"" has sponsored 5 coins]"
62,"Aug 26, 2021",This kid seems innocent but- I’m not sure abt that.. 😅
62,"Aug 26, 2021","""I am rather mentally stable"" can't relate"
62,"Aug 26, 2021",That's why Dokja wanted the ability he got on the acupuncture room so he can paralyze his opponents instead of killing them.... Eventually the enemy will die since they failed the stage mission 
62,"Aug 26, 2021",Sangah is the moral compass of the group 
62,"Aug 25, 2021","Sangah is a cutie pie, amd Gilyeong is a tad more murderous cutie pie"

62,"Aug 29, 2021","Dyk?The novel actually has 551 chapters. Right now we're on chapter 61 and it's been a year since the webtoon version was released. So if the webtoon were to finish, it would take another 7 years for it to be done! Lol I'd be 21 by that time"

62,"Sep 28, 2021",Wonder who the highest constellation is? Whats the difference between fable and mythical? Don't a lot of Asian fables use mythical or regular characters? I keep thinking Dokja might call on the tortoise or hare.

""Fourth wall"" is the boundary between reality and fiction. since Kim Dokja read all of the TWSA he might have gained that ability for that. I believe fourth wall ables him to block all elements that only exist in fiction or his mind is still that off a reader that view that world as a novel. Considering most of the abilities he had were that of a reader including character profile. I haven't read the novel tho I will soon. "

I hope he gets to take a constellation eventually. I know he hates them but ngl the fact that he doesn't have one has stunted his growth.

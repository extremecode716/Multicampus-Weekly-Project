117,"Aug 10, 2022","The sheer level of bad@ssery from Wukong and Uriel, when they were ready to duke it out with Persephone sent chills down my spine. No amount of imagery can top just how awesome those words alone were!"
117,"Aug 10, 2022","considering Persephone seemed to imply Hades wants what Zeus has with Hercules, I think she's setting Dokja up to be an adoptive son for Hades , or something similar to that despite it apparently heralding the end for the constellations (again, just another guess)"

117,"Sep 15, 2022","Okay but why is Persephone me. ‚ÄúTake these away, they‚Äôre too bland,‚Äù in response to the banquet of stories in front of her. I find myself having the same attitude towards a lot of stories I come across. The most popular, supposed ‚Äúbest‚Äù comics and novels all seem cliche and overdone to me now. They used to get me excited, but now everything seems bland. Except this story. This comic is the one that puts me on the edge of my seat every chapter.

117,"Aug 10, 2022",you know what I'd find interesting? if the Secret plotter was actually the real author and they didn't like how their story ended so they released it to the human world to find a variable that could help them make a better story. enter our main man.
117,"Aug 10, 2022",Persephone seemed scared of the Judge of the Demonic Flame and Prisoner with the Golden headband. I wonder what those deities could be ü§î 
117,"Aug 10, 2022",more like the might of the under-boob with that kind of view ü§§ü§§

117,"Oct 5, 2022","Lmao I bet some people were like ""you can eat me mommy Persephone"" ü§£üòÇ I do like that was bluffing and that Wukong and Uriel (I think that's the correct angel Demonic Judge of Fire I forgor) are stronger than her. Even more interesting is that Hades could tell when Dokja set foot but waited to see what he would do. Dokja will be the champion of the Hades and the Underworld üí™ üëè Persephone as Sangah in that dress üî• Thank you for the fan service "

The next scenario shows something that looks like a huge branch or a root, reminds me of a certain mythology that has a big tree called Yggdrasil. I remember one particular snake, big enough to circle the whole earth. As much as I'd love to see the Midgard Snake J√∂rmungandr, I don't want him to die. "

117,"Sep 14, 2022",There are many serpents in mythology and the Hydra is one of the most famous ones. I‚Äôm guessing that the 6 scenario is going to be Norse themed meaning that the serpent he may kill is J√∂rmungandr aka the World Snake a child of Loki. It would be a fitting Labor for him to have completed. Perhaps it could be a different serpent for all we know.
117,"Sep 14, 2022",is he going to face medusa? is he covering his eyes because of medusa‚Äôs gaze that turns people into stone?

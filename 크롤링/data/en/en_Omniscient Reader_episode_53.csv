Episode,Date,Review
53,"May 5, 2021",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' is currently throwing tables and is mad about the cliffhanger.] [5 coins have been sponsored. ]
53,"May 5, 2021","this man, this man right here just destroyed my expectations of this chapter in a brilliant way, I was not expecting this and now I am quivering in excitement. Edit: thank you to all of you for making this a top comment! send love to the creator and gift some coins to our favorite protagonist!"
53,"May 5, 2021","EDIT: They changed it back to King of No Killing, THANK YOU so much translator-nim!!  Aaahhhhh!!! This episode gave me chills!!! Same energy as 'You have become a ghost species' from ep. 32! ***spoilers in the replies*** "
53,"May 5, 2021","So... Dokja is impersonating Jungyeok, and someone else is impersonating Dokja. Wack."
53,"May 5, 2021",Dokja really pulled a suicide just to be a smart ass
53,"May 5, 2021","You know, you don't expect the MC to die 50 chapters in. One of the reasons I love ORV üòå amazing plot twists, and THANK GOD WE'LL GET TO SEE DOKJA'S NORMAL FACE SOON "
53,"May 5, 2021","Immortal King is misleading, King of No Killing is a better description. Not saying it‚Äôs the best name, but Immortal King sounds a bit wrong"
53,"May 5, 2021","This is one of the many chapters I've been waiting to see adapted. Shame they changed his title to Immortal King, not quite how that one works while giving a bit of what it does away compared to King of No Killing. Besides, King of No Killing really hammers in what the condition needs to be, especially with later character responses."
53,"May 5, 2021","I won't spoil anything, I'd just like to say I'm glad everyone will get to experience the amazing world of Omniscient Readers Viewpoint. You all are in for a very long and exciting journey ‚ò∫Ô∏è (On par with ToG) "
53,"May 5, 2021","King of no killing makes more sense, please change it!-Edit ‚Äúimmortal king‚Äù would sound busted and more inciting than ‚Äúking of no killing‚Äù right?"
53,"May 5, 2021",ok but Hyunsung and Heewon screaming for Dokja makes my heart hurt üòîüò≠
53,"May 5, 2021",at first I was like take all my money as a joke but I don't think is a joke anymore 
53,"May 5, 2021","Anyone else notice that the game of capture the flag isn't over, even though Dokja's completed the king's path? Chungmuro still hasn't taken their target station yet"
53,"May 5, 2021","Death Count, One! finally!! that said though while ""Immortal King"" sounds cool and all, the original ""King of No Killing"" really is much more appropriate given the limitations and conditions for his so-called ""immortality"" "
53,"May 5, 2021",Immortal King?? King of No Killing sounds so much better üòîüòî webtoon pls I'm begging you
53,"May 5, 2021","I wish they wouldn't change titles/words from the original so much. Like, ""Immortal King"" totally kills the suspense of this moment. I was SHOOK when this happened in the web novel bc ""King of No Killing"" doesn't give it away. I hope it at least has the same rules as king of no killing. Also, I want Gilyeong to call Dokja 'hyung' like he does in the novel. It's so precious ü•∫"
53,"May 9, 2021",Kim Dokja Death Count: 1 
53,"May 5, 2021","I wish they had gone with ""King of no Killing"" instead of ""Immortal King"" The name ""Immortal King"" is far too misleading"
53,"May 5, 2021",DOKJA KIM NO! HE'S TOO HOT TO DIEüò≠üò≠üò≠
53,"May 5, 2021","Uhh, I don't want to sound harsh, but it'd be better if they changed 'Immortal King' title to the original, no? (King of No Killing) It makes more sense, and the former kinda gives it away :\"
53,"May 5, 2021","Yooooo what if the one who has read all of the series is the writer himself. Maybe he‚Äôs trying to lure dokja in to meet him himself, just a thought. Would be cool if it was true."
53,"May 5, 2021",King of no killing is so much better and it adds more suspense to the end of the chapter 
53,"Jun 23, 2021",Hmmm I prefer ‚ÄúKing of No Killing‚Äù over ‚ÄúImmortal King‚Äù
53,"May 5, 2021",I bet 30 dollars that the real junghyeok will take care of chungmuro EDIT: um?? 
53,"May 5, 2021",How much you want to bet the King Prophet is actually the author of TWSA? He would be the only other one that would know the ending without showing up online as a reader besides Dokja ü§î
53,"May 5, 2021","Man dokja really just ran at a giant dragon so that he could get burnt, no matter how immortal he ends up being because of the 10 stations that's ballsy as hell and it probably hurts a bit anyways"
53,"May 5, 2021","I can not stress this enough when I say. ""What The Absolute FUCK!"""
53,"May 5, 2021","WAIIITTTT THEY CHANGED HIS TITLE!! His title should be ""King of no killings""......."
53,"May 5, 2021",immortal king vs shadow monarch....? thatd be sweet!
53,"May 5, 2021",Immortal King is somewhat even more misleading than King of No Killing...
53,"Jun 23, 2021","CORRECTION - Dokja never said ""should I sacrifice someone"" rather he said ""will someone have to be sacrificed"". These minor translation mistakes might twist Dokja's personality. Dokja is not ruthless killer TT TT"
53,"May 5, 2021",Immortal king... The original text is 'Î∂àÏÇ¥(‰∏çÊÆ∫)' It means you don't kill someone. The word that means immortal is 'Î∂àÏÇ¨(‰∏çÊ≠ª)'. And junghyeok's skill 'tiger god aura'.... The original text means self-defense aura.
53,"Jun 23, 2021","kim dokja: survives a train car massacre, meeting yoo joonghyuk, 4 days inside a tier 8 monster without any food or rest (barely), a desperate, manipulated group of ppl with weapons, trauma, an endless horde of monsters without a green zone, surpressed mental breakdowns, a bunch of movies trying to kill him, FIGHTING YOO JOONGHYUK, a double ambush, and calmly walking into enemy territory TWICE. also kim dokja: dies by doing nothing and just standing there like a idiot"
53,"May 5, 2021","Screen: Ur dead.Dojka: Let‚Äôs goooo. Death is but another scenario. 
The team, prophets, constellations, dobaeki, the fandom, and then some: Wtf"
53,"May 10, 2021",Love how Dokja just called all there bluffs with I can die...but you can't afford for me to die.  Totally something Yu would do hah!
53,"Jun 16, 2021","Did they really just replace King of No Killing with Immortal King? This is a terrible change. It doesn't describe the perks and setbacks at all. 1: Immortal implies that he can't die, but he can. He just resurrects. 2: King of No Killing describes the biggest setback of choosing it while Immortal King would make most people think that it's ok for him to kill since in movies and such, immortals are usually displayed as the bad guys who have no problem killing."
53,"May 5, 2021","chapter 38 of waiting for yoo sangah in a black chinese dress and garter belt. also, they changed the kings name from King of No Killing to Immortal King, but it would make more sense if it was the original since he cant kill anyone now."
53,"Jun 23, 2021","This chapter was so hype, I'm still quite upset about ""King of No Killing"" being changed to ""Immortal King"" though,, It's kinda misleading. One of the reasons why Dokja was able to get such a title was because nobody wanted it since not being able to kill people can be really bad when it comes to the scenarios. However, if the title was ""Immortal King"" then surely someone would grab it, especially since they wouldn't know the conditions."
53,"May 5, 2021","The first time is always special üòá and I prefere ""King of no Killing"" than ""Immortal King"" :("
53,"Jun 25, 2021","dear translators, you'll probably never see this but its ""No Killing"" Î∂àÏÇ¥ (bul sal) and you translated it to ""immortal"" Î∂àÏÇ¨ (bul sa).It looks like a small mistake but it changes a lot of things for the story and kills the suspense. "
53,"Jun 23, 2021","I really hope the translator would change the title 'Immortal King' to 'King of No Killing'. It's not just for aesthetic purposes or just for sticking with the novel, but Immortal King is a little misleading. It gives him a different vibe that won't translate as well in the future chapters. I won't spoil, but really, King of No Killing fits better with the upcoming narrative."
53,"Jun 23, 2021","Wth webtoon... At least ""King of no killing"" made you feel a smidge of doubt about whats going to happen. ""Immortal King"" makes it blatantly obvious."
53,"May 5, 2021","there goes Dokja-ssi rushing off on his own again without us üôÑ also hmm 'king of no killing' vs 'immortal king', doesn't that change the meaning of the effect?"
53,"May 5, 2021","my dude just hit them with a ""psh, nothing personnel kid"" and let that dragon torch them all. 10/10 outstanding move"
53,"May 7, 2021","ok, loose theory time. Dokja is actually the true regressor but his memories get scrambled and his stigmata changes at some point and starts to take over the identity of the main character in the story because that's all he remembers and since he forgot hes wearing the mask he never tries to take it off which is why he has the face that he does."
53,"Jun 23, 2021",When you kill yourself just to prove someone wrong
53,"Jun 23, 2021",[The constellation ‚ÄòNovel Reader‚Äô welcomes you to the start of Dokjas constant self sacrificing.]
53,"Jun 23, 2021","haha, imagine Mr. Junghyeok is pretending to be Dokja while Dokja pretends to be Junghyeok"
53,"May 5, 2021","Hyeonsong and Huiwon screams were very emptional tho, props to the visuals team üëèüëè"
53,"May 5, 2021",I'd prefer the King of No Killing as it probably give more context on the current ability of Dokja
53,"May 6, 2021","In the novel this is explained and called the ‚ÄúKing of No Killing‚Äù rather then ‚ÄúImmortal King‚Äù which means that so long as he never once directly takes the life of another living human, he is able to resurrect a total of 10 times, though he will still experience the pain of dying and any psychological effects minus what the fourth wall can prevent. This is very important since if he does kill anyone, even in self defense, he would lose the title of King and its powers."
53,"May 6, 2021",Did you die? Yes. But I lived!!
53,"Jun 23, 2021",This man keeps cheating death in so many ways. 
53,"Jun 23, 2021",can we PLEASE get someone who has read the translated novel on the team? you're skipping important information and making the story feel bland with all those poorly done translations choices. such a shame. maybe double check on terms and names from now on?
53,"May 8, 2021",To anyone who hasn‚Äôt yet‚Äîread the light novel. Dojka pulls many ‚Äúpro gamer‚Äù moves yet to come üòÇ
53,"May 6, 2021",Damn Dokja you crazy son a b*tch. I  was not expecting that. 
53,"May 7, 2021",Who else wants to buy more fast pass episodes but can‚Äôt because there‚Äôs currently none left to buy-?
53,"Jun 23, 2021","Hi! I have never written a comment on any WEBTOON until now. I just wanted to thank the author for creating such great content! I love the twists and turns you lead your readers through. There‚Äôs always something new and exciting going on. I‚Äôve been reading WEBTOONs for some time now and this has quickly become my new favorite. Again, thank you so much and keep doing such a fantastic job!"
53,"May 13, 2021",Great chapter! But I still prefer ‚ÄúKing of No Killing‚Äù...
53,"Jun 23, 2021","I prefer ""King of no killing"" over ""Immortal King"", as it both explains his role and has a dual meaning. (FYI, some people might think this is kind of like a spoiler...) Briefly explained, as long as he doesn't kill anyone, and gains enough karma, he can resurrect."
53,"Jun 23, 2021","I just finished reading the lightnovel... you guys are in for a wild ride, thank you for this masterpiece"
53,"Jun 23, 2021","Immortal king is misleading and killed the suspence. The title King of no killing would not have implied he is going to survive somehow so now we would be sitting on the edges of our chairs. Also, it is not a skill but a title, attribute. A skill evolves, an attribute can be lost. Grave mistake smh"
53,"Jun 25, 2021",When the impersonator gets impersonated 
53,"Jun 25, 2021","Is the prophet who read the whole prophecy the author? Cause besides Dokja, the only other person who would know about this whole thing is the author. Either that or the disciple is bluffing."
53,"Jun 24, 2021",I‚Äôve read a lot of WEBTOONs over the last 3-4 ish years and this is by far the beat and my favorite. Other have either lost my interest or been sappy. This is genius. 
53,"Jun 23, 2021",The last two webtoons I read today had a cute couple kiss each other on the cheek as a monumental moment‚Ä¶ then I come here and Dokja gets dragon breath to the face 
53,"Jun 23, 2021","do you remember when dokja was just an silent office worker that enjoyed reading? yeah, me neither"
53,"Jun 23, 2021",Dokja saying you only live once lolllll üòÇüòÇüòÇ
53,"Jun 23, 2021",aaaaah the start of dokja‚Äôs death count... ‚ò∫Ô∏è
53,"May 12, 2021","i just hoped that they didn't change some things... i like the title ""king of no killing"" more than the immortal king because of the context. Also, i hope they change the ""disciples"" back to ""apostles"". They are gonna tackle about disciples later and it's different than these ""apostles"". The title ""Apostles"" is also in parallel to the apostles of jesus, and why they treat the ""novel"" as a ""book of revelations"" like some bible thing."
53,"May 6, 2021","God I love this series so much, got literal chills from this episode"
53,"May 5, 2021",that dragon just clapped our boys checks... wonder if he felt the pain?
53,"Jul 1, 2021",dokja really said YOLO
53,"Jun 26, 2021",And so Dokja‚Äôs addiction to dying begins‚Ä¶ üò´
53,"Jun 25, 2021",how is the creator so good with the planning.... like it's not an ordinary romance comedy comic. you need so much skill to plan out everything properly and this looks so perfect! great job to the creator! 
53,"Jun 23, 2021","Well that was unexpected, you can't go around threatening the MC like that. "
53,"Jun 23, 2021",[ you have died ] what a cute way yo tell someone that he is dead
53,"Jun 23, 2021","guys i don't think it mattered anymore if they call him dokja again, the disciples are dead (and so are most of the prophets but nobody cares abt them lmao)"
53,"Jun 23, 2021","Wish this translator had stuck with ""King of No Killing"" than ""Immortal King"", since the former is a more clever way to describe the conditions better AND isn't so obvious what the perks of it are. ""Immortal"" also sounds more appealing and the obvious choice than ""No Killing"" given the nature of the scenarios. Oh well."
53,"Jun 23, 2021",NO IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE 'KING OF NO KILLING' >:O
53,"Jun 25, 2021",[you have died] I died in that part
53,"Jun 24, 2021","[You have died.]*panik*
[The skill, Immortal King, has taken effect.]
*kalm*"
53,"Jun 24, 2021",Death count: 1
53,"Jun 24, 2021",Wtf did I just read!?! Dude total mind f u c k right there
53,"Jun 23, 2021",changing dokja's king title is something i didn't really expect tbh. it's quite disappointing and new readers didn't get to feel the suspense we did when we read the novel. changing apostles into disciples is fine and not that big of a deal but changing the title dokja has taken is just sad. there are reasons why it was called what it was called. i'll hope the translators change it though i feel like it won't happen.
53,"Jun 23, 2021",Well If anyone pretends to be Dokja He is screwed xD
53,"Jun 23, 2021",Maybe the other person who‚Äôs read it is the author?? And that is why they don‚Äôt like being called a renouncer??
53,"Jun 16, 2021",m gonna cry... I can't express just how much I love this webtoon. like it's the best & I need it in an anime too. this is just sosososooso brilliant
53,"May 7, 2021",I have gone from just knowing about this webtoon to spending all my coins just to keep reading in a matter of 2 days üòÖ ITS SO GOOD
53,"May 5, 2021","I love the fact that the ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" constellation has become universal."
53,"Oct 20, 2021",And this everyone is dokja's first official death 
53,"Jul 6, 2021",üîîdingüîî *you have died* 
53,"Jul 2, 2021",A new king is bornnnnnn
53,"Jun 30, 2021",I'm glad that I didn't notice the update and read this episode by only today so I don't have to be left in a cliffhanger
53,"Jun 27, 2021",Yuh the first Dojka death for the webtoon peeps! Iconic!!!
53,"Jun 27, 2021",You have died.Same
53,"Jun 26, 2021",okay but the most mysterious person in this webtoon is def the author of twsa. the author mentioned winning a contest because of dokja so i think that the reward for winning the contest is that the world will be warped according to what the author has written. perhaps the condition for winning is to have someone read until the end before a certain time limit. ü§î
53,"Jun 25, 2021","this scene was already so powerful in the novel, so it's great to see just as captivating storytelling in the manhwa!! personal fave panel is dokja selecting his king's path while people burn in the background"
53,"Jun 24, 2021","lets gooo, Dokja smelled out the rat and dealt with him accordingly! Also i wonder who is claiming to have read the whole thing, coz they gonna have their ass whooped"
53,"Jun 24, 2021",Dokja: Sadly I died.. But I lived!!! 
53,"Jun 23, 2021",‚ÄúYou have died‚Äù holy shit that hit me like a train 
53,"Jun 23, 2021",Man I picked a bad time to catch up on these episodesüò≠
53,"Jun 23, 2021",This WEBTOON is among the best I‚Äôve seen and I will continue to watch every week 
53,"Jun 23, 2021","it was quite a surprised to see ""immortal king"" because it just spoiled the whole story? well not whole but the early part of it. i think given by the power with what dokja should have when he receive the title ""king of no killing"" kim dokja is indeed can't kill anyone in the next chapter would be much a lot better than ""immortal king"". sounds too op when dokja is not THAT op"
53,"Jun 23, 2021",OOP they called him Dokja out loud‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt wait to see how this unfold üò¨üò¨
53,"Jun 23, 2021","""-it was one of my favourite scenes."" Sometimes I don't know whether you're Yoo Joonghyuk's simp or a hater"
53,"Jun 23, 2021","'King of No Killing' to 'Immortal King', huh. I don't know why, but now I'm afraid they will also translate the [Story] titles differently later on üò• perhaps this is just me being nitpicky, but one of the things that make orv unique for me is it's choice of words and phrasing at naming something, especially the modifiers and [Story] tittles; those name usually has a certain depth in it and often self explanatory. that's why I prefer 'King of No Killing' coz 'Immortal King' isn't quite right"
53,"Jun 23, 2021","I wish they had kept the ""King of No Killing"", this is one of my favorite chapters, the way it blows our minds is just different"
53,"Jun 23, 2021",this mf my heart he 
53,"Jun 23, 2021",not me thinking: should I use my coins? but if they update next week I already read it- so I have to wait two weeks!?...but the cliffhanger üò≠‚úãüèª
53,"Jun 23, 2021",*sad King of No Killing noises*
53,"Jun 16, 2021",Shit! I spend coins to skip to this episode but that cliffhanger is worse than the previous one!! Shit shit shit. And now I have to wait 2 weeks. Urgggh... Curiosity is bad üò≠üò≠
53,"May 7, 2021","I really hope this becomes an anime one day, this story is absolutely phenomenal!"
53,"Jun 23, 2021",'King of no killing' suited much better instead of 'immortal king' coz it explains the meaning much better n also for the future chapters I hope webtoon keeps the translations coz it will only confused the non novel readers and ours as well coz it ruins the interest ...anyway the chapter was good and please remeber to give a like coz thelikes of the chapters r going down.
53,"Aug 28, 2021","time to reread this webtoon and finally, it is now ""King of No Killing"""
53,"Jul 1, 2021",this episode left me like wHaT :v
53,"Jun 30, 2021","‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I just completed reading Light Novel, you guys will not believe what happen in end and why this all started...‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Damn wish this Webtoon to complete till  chapters 551...
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I think that the Chapter 551 is not the Last Chapter...#####

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ (Do u guys know that -
One chapter of Webtoon is equal to One chapter of Light Novel)
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ So their will be 551 Chapters of Webtoon...
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Iam so Hyped right now..."
53,"Jun 27, 2021","I got scared when ""you just die"" gushh love this webtoon "
53,"Jun 26, 2021","the name ""Immortal King"" totally loses out on the whole context... like, why would anyone NOT choose a title like Immortal King? dear translators, with everyone complaining about this change (and the change itself making Dokja's actions lose so much meaning), I hope you'll change it soon"
53,"Jun 26, 2021","(kind of spoilers) finally, his first death... kim dokja my squid bastard"
53,"Jun 26, 2021",Hope this bitch saved his game at the nearest checkpoint üòÇüòÇüòÇ
53,"Jun 26, 2021",So did 5 of the prophets Die? Did Dokja just eliminate half of them?? I can‚Äôt wait to see!
53,"Jun 26, 2021",oh my god that was beautiful
53,"Jun 25, 2021",Outsmarted the smart guys. that's my Dokja
53,"Jun 25, 2021",This man really went YOLO and proceeded to yeet himself into the after life üòÇ 
53,"Jun 24, 2021","‚ÄúOh you have to listen to us. You don‚Äôt have any other options‚Äù Dokja, ‚Äúaiight bet mf‚Äù"
53,"Jun 24, 2021",Way to blow his cover you guys. Have more faith in your leader. 
53,"Jun 23, 2021","king of no killing -> immortal king, and I am broke üò≠üò≠ why webtoon change a lot of term from the novel translation, king of no killing is based the definition of the skill. truly I want to complain to the translator directly, I just want the translation get better"
53,"Jun 23, 2021",DOKJA DAMN MAN! Ahhhh‚ù§Ô∏è you‚Äôre so badass omg (¬¥‡ºé‡∫∂‡ΩºœÅ‡ºé‡∫∂‡Ωº`) take my heart
53,"Jun 23, 2021",Dokja balls of titanium.
53,"Jun 23, 2021","Unluckily for those idiots trying to take over Chudmuro, Junghyeok is actually there still, so..."
53,"Jun 23, 2021","it should be ""king of no killing"", not immortal king. please make corrections "
53,"Jun 23, 2021",I am Reading this since it started here and I am never disappointed with any arc so far. If this keeps up Till the end OR is my fav series in any categorie you wanna loop it with. right now i feel Like i am observing a masterpiece being brought to daylight. 
53,"Jun 23, 2021",The king of the renouncers claiming to have read the whole story must be a bluff. Checking the first episode the later chapters shown had only 1 view: our main character. I guess that the renouncer king is doing that to stay in power. Once they are past the known story he would have no more value than the others.Also why do they all try to force things to happen they have read? The hero died in those regressions after all.
53,"Jun 23, 2021",as soon as i get a Job i will become a constalation too xD
53,"Jun 23, 2021",Waitttt!!! They screamed Dokja's name!! He is disguising himself as Junghyeok rn!! Omggg they just blew his cover ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ
53,"Jun 23, 2021","Nah that's it I'm writing to Webtoon rn. They been making too many mistakes. Okie I can accept ""King of no Killing"" = ""Immortal King"". But Attribute ‚â† Skill, the whole power system will be confusing."
53,"Jun 23, 2021",hmm... immortal king huh.... it does sound cool but this will be a problem in the future (slight spoilers regarding his title in the comments for details)
53,"Jun 23, 2021",HELP SO SOMEONE IS IMPERSONATING HIM??
53,"Jun 23, 2021","Well, I think King of No killing delivered it more better...rather than Immortal King, you know what I mean well I think you will find out in the next chapter. I don't mind it that much but nevermind that, the chapter is good and that is the thing I care about most!"
53,"Jun 23, 2021","I agree with all the comments here. I prefer ""King of no killing"" than ""Immortal King"" cause thats way too misleading. Plus, ""King of no killing"" makes sense in the future part of the story"
53,"Jun 23, 2021",NO!!!! THE DYING CYCLE HAS STARTED!!
53,"Jun 7, 2021",wasnt that king of no killing
53,"May 7, 2021",Y‚Äôall every get worried this is going to happen at the end of this and just keep throwing in the coins juuuuuust in case?
53,"May 6, 2021",‚Äúand that was the story of how I died‚Äù
53,"May 5, 2021",How can a webtoon be so good ?
53,"May 5, 2021","Wait- i just realize it, so webtoon translator choose ""Disciple"" instead of ""Apostle"" huh? This make me confuse :("
53,"May 5, 2021","Holy shitballs, this was intense. Brilliant move, Dokja. Brilliant move. "
53,"May 5, 2021",What a top tier flex.
53,"May 5, 2021",JESUS DOKJA UR A FUCKING GENIUS I LOVE U
53,"May 5, 2021","Welp, there he goes. It hurt seeing Hyunsung & Heewon crying out to him w/ his real name. Also, how could that disciple leave out our goddess, Sangah üò§ It was adorable to see that Pildu let Gilyoung sleep on his leg~"
53,"May 5, 2021",Mans is burning to death and smiling- Dokja you are not ok
53,"May 5, 2021",DOKJA DID YOU JUST DIE-

53,"Jun 23, 2021","I get a little sad with the change of title and skill names, many of them have iconic names in the novel and when they change they often lose their meaning.

53,"Jun 23, 2021","ngl the names given to Kings in the fan translated novel sounds way cooler than the names of the Kings here. ""Immortal King"" was ""King of No killing"" then. still appreciate this tho ^^"
53,"Jun 23, 2021",Immortal king seems like it'll make it a tad more difficult to die + his station matches their station with a king + the actual guy is still at that station so they aren't as weak as the renouncers believe 
53,"Jun 23, 2021","The immortal king doesn't fit nearly as well. It's supposed to be king of no killing because it can only be gotten if you don't kill anyone. Yes, the benefit is that he can get lives by sparing people, but that's not the most important part."

53,"Jun 24, 2021",....b-but why
53,"Jun 24, 2021",So does immortal king give allow him to regress a few times? If it were to allow him to regress an infinite amount of times he‚Äôd most likely get the title regressor like Junghyeok but that‚Äôs clearly not the case

53,"May 5, 2021",Haven‚Äôt read it but it‚Äôs probably good.
53,"Jun 24, 2021","just a comment to address all the ""king of no killing"" vs ""immortal king"" stuff... I feel like novel readers are being nitpicky. What if the translators didn't read the novel and are literally translating as the comic comes? I do understand where it's coming from (just about a chapter or 2 ahead since I started reading) but still, I feel like many times webnovels readers nitpick the translators work to death since they have read ahead. sheesh y'all"
53,"Jun 24, 2021",Holy sh- does this mean Dokja is now a regressor or something like it!?!? üò±
53,"Dec 5, 2021",He doesn't care about his friends.
53,"Jun 28, 2021","Hey,Spoiler here!(not really),Kim Dok Ja would become Jesus Christ and read the same story under a bootstrap loop"
53,"Jun 26, 2021",If this is the top comment I will beat the crap out of the lesser dragon
53,"Sep 26, 2021",Why not just name it King of Mercy (or Merciful King)? That sounds way cooler than King of No Killing. The first title didn't really need changing and it's not like it's really that any of those names are that much of a spoiler to change them. I wonder who unnecessarily complained about that and caused the translators to change it. 
53,"Jun 23, 2021","lol king of no killing?? nope that wouldn't. explain it at all,.. a king of no killing would die due to not plucking the weeds that are strangling the garden,.. immortals are mystic beings that surpasses mortal limitations which includes the warrior class dragon slayers and those who can survive worse than a blast to the face,..[void watcher twin meteor] is broke AF so cliff hanging until next time "
53,"Jun 23, 2021","Yay. More people spoiling by complaining about the translation. Woo Hoo... üéâ I wish Webtoons would hurry up and make a ""don't see comments"" toggle for each series you read individually. "

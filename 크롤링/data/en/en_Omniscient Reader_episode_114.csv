114,"Jul 20, 2022","Hehehe, look at this inner monologue of Dokja after my boy Namwoon said he reflected. // I was speechless. The Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon reflecting was as impossible as Yoo Joonghyuk becoming a girl. I knew it was a lie but I still activated Lie Detection as a last courtesy for him. In any case, it was a skill that I acquired to use."

It's a really new webtoon that just came out, but it has a very similar feel to this and the artwork is on par with this one. I'm very selective about the webtoons I follow, and I fast passed through MIO and I'm hooked. I believe it releases the day after Omniscient Reader each week. Check it out. "

114,"Aug 27, 2022",I stayed up all night to finish this i stopped reading at episode 67 I really wanna see Kim revive the beast lady I've been super hyped reading this whole thing I can't wait to see what this series evoles into or to see the ending 😊
114,"Aug 27, 2022","""A stroll through the underworld"""

114,"Aug 26, 2022",so intense 
114,"Aug 26, 2022","That was one huge risk he took, even though I knew he would get out of it somehow it still had me worrying :,)"
114,"Aug 26, 2022",doesn't DOKJA have ice resistance
114,"Aug 25, 2022","they look like dementors, the judges"
114,"Aug 25, 2022",It's a good thing Dokja has Cold Resistance 😏
114,"Aug 25, 2022",The nerve! 
114,"Aug 25, 2022",I've only read the novel but wtf are these comments? is this the community of this masterpice? I had a stroke reading the comments 
114,"Aug 25, 2022","if dokja can bring back life, then waht about namwoon? I hope he also bring him too 🤣🤣"
114,"Aug 25, 2022",I'm really liking Namwoon this ch but idk if I should 😃 we're getting distracted (p.s gumdam boy best boy) 
114,"Aug 25, 2022",ugh I finished it too fast 💔
114,"Aug 25, 2022","I love to see Namwoon again, he really scared me at the beginning of the story and now he's a quarter of a reformed self."
114,"Aug 25, 2022",Turning over a new leaf for the dead ksksksksks
114,"Aug 25, 2022",The quest said to “avoid “ being caught by the judges???? So why didn’t he just suddenly fail the scenario? I’m confused. But I’m just gonna assume this is fiction therefore things don’t have to make complete sense for the story to continue
114,"Aug 25, 2022",I thought he got cold resistance when he defeated the dragon catastrophe!
114,"Aug 25, 2022","The way he just straight up told Namwoon that he’s the intruder 💀 Dokja, you crazy bastard, what are you DOINNNNGGG AAAAAAAA I mean I know he’ll be fine lmao but good grief why is he like this pfft— also Namwoon is adorable and his duality is fuckin everything <333"

114,"Aug 25, 2022","""gosh,you really are the master of manipulation."" DAMN RIGHT HE IS"
114,"Aug 25, 2022",Namwoon is just adorable haha!!! I am starting to like him more!
114,"Aug 25, 2022","If I remember correctly, didn't Dokja snag <Cold Resistance> after dying during his fight with the dragon? Shouldn't he be mostly immune to the ice? Also, I'm so glad that Namwoon wasn't only used for three chapters and is coming back to the plot, even if only for a short while."
114,"Aug 25, 2022",Wow Dokja really charged in there without a plan!   Cannot wait to see what this underworld arc entails 👍
114,"Aug 24, 2022",I think i gave the first like...

114,"Aug 24, 2022",you can say kdj looked really *cool* towards the end there :D i was looking forward to reading this chapter again here on webtoon because of how good kdj looks at the end heh

114,"Jul 27, 2022","I really want to buy the next chapter, but considering the latest news about the death of S0l0 l3v3lling illustrator, I'm hesitant. I hope that case makes a huge impact on the Webtoon companies and makes them trying to create better deadline and working environment for all of illustrators."
114,"Jul 27, 2022",How can he freeze if he had that cold resistance skill? Is that skill gone?? 👩🏻‍🦯
114,"Jul 21, 2022","if I had Dokja's balls, I'll probably go play bowling. They're so huge I'll be sure to win against everyone "

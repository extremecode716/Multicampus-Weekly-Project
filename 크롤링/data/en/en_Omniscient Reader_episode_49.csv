Episode,Date,Review
49,"Apr 7, 2021","Dokja really spent 5000 coins to be like ""🏃‍♂️💨what are you reading 😃"""
49,"Apr 7, 2021",I just love the fact that he's like we all read this book of revelations meanwhile this man read the whole thing.
49,"Apr 7, 2021","PLS DOKJA I'M GETTING SECONDHAND EMBARRASSMENT FROM THE ""KNEEL"" -Edit: to people who found it hot, don't be offended by this, I'm just a novel reader that likes to bully him :)"
49,"Apr 7, 2021","""The Ninth one to stop reading? Fuckin Normie.""-Dokja"
49,"Apr 7, 2021","Dokja be like ""I am already 4 parallel universes ahead of you"""
49,"Apr 7, 2021",Heewon bowing down to Dokja is freaking hilarious and Hyunsung doing it out of confusion makes it even better 
49,"Apr 7, 2021","Just openly blabs ""you're not even in the supporting cast."" "
49,"Apr 7, 2021","it's probably a good thing they translated it as renouncer and not ""those who got off"" 🤣😂"
49,"Apr 7, 2021","our Man has the whole book, meanwhile this guy is desperately fishing for info from the other fakes.  there is only one true prophet.  All Hail Dokja Kim, the sole Revelator, the Omniscient Reader!
then run from the crazy sword lady, She’s a paladin and you should not mess with Paladins."
49,"Apr 7, 2021",I really love Huiwon. Also Dokja casually spending 5000 coins to be nosey is great.
49,"Apr 9, 2021","Wait, I'm pretty sure after the kneel scene, the constellations are most likely gonna think Dokja wanted to do some kinky shit with that guy since most of what they're talking is gonna get censored. Plus the constellations think Dokja is gay since, you know, they think him and Junghyeok Yu are dating lol"
49,"Apr 7, 2021","Yikes bro what a shame ... your one of those that stopped reading?... he must have ran out of coins😅, you need a loan? Because I have 5000 to spare 😆"
49,"Apr 7, 2021","Heewon our unbothered queen (that mid-air pose tho)! It was adorable how Hyunsung copied her w/out knowing the context. Tbh I pictured Donghoon differently, but that sitting pose while biting his thumb is a nice homage to L. Also, I just can't take Dokja's YJH portrayal seriously 😂 ""Why do you keep playing with your phone!?"" He's just not impressed w/ these wannabe prophets smh"
49,"Apr 7, 2021",waiting for the real jungheyok yu to randomly show up and absolutly confuse everyone there. 
49,"Apr 7, 2021",Dokja: Don't let him say any thing stupid.Huwoin: He didn't say we couldn't do something stupid.
49,"Apr 7, 2021",Dokja commanding “kneel” got me feeling some sort of way 😏
49,"Apr 7, 2021",Dokja is out here playing 4D mental chess 🤣
49,"Apr 7, 2021",if I stop paying fast pass. I have to wait 7 weeks for a free episode. FOURTY NINE DAYS! can't stop. won't stop. this is one of my favorites.
49,"Apr 7, 2021","someone, somewhere is feeling personally attacked by this ""king of the basement dwellers"" thing 😂😂😂"
49,"Apr 7, 2021","So there's gonna be a mythical ""non-renouncer"" that the Prophets try to find but it's just Dokja the whole time, right? "
49,"Apr 9, 2021","""Are you picking a fight with me when you're not even in the supporting cast?"" sir, us readers don't even know you tf"
49,"Apr 7, 2021","[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb"" wishes to have a good internet connection too so the it can watch the stream smoothly.][5 coins have been sponsored.]"
49,"Apr 7, 2021",“Too hard to decipher”... so basically your a dumbass lol 
49,"Apr 7, 2021","I’ll admit that I, too, was once a student who didn’t read the whole book and was then called out during class discussion"
49,"Apr 7, 2021","I wonder when Dokja’s being the final reader will outwear its usefulness. So much in the story is changing already in these early days, and if the Prophets are all banding together, that does give them a lot of power, even if their skills are inferior."
49,"Apr 7, 2021","So he’s the ninth reader—son, you up against the omniscient reader, the one guy who knows alllll. Now bow before yo gadamn KING. 😂"
49,"Apr 7, 2021","I wonder then, how far exactly did they all read?  Who has gotten past where we are in the story right now and the first guy, how far did he get it?  This is all really interesting"
49,"Apr 7, 2021",It’s funny how were reading the revelations of the revelations they’re reading 🥴🤯
49,"Apr 7, 2021",Is it me or does the artwork look even better than usual in this chapter?
49,"Apr 7, 2021",👁 👄 👁  “Kneel.”
49,"May 26, 2021","I genuinely love how the prophet is like “unfortunately, the original copy of the sacred text was lost” and Dokja’s just sitting there like “bruh, i got the entire thing on my phone, what you talking about?”"
49,"May 6, 2021","Dokja really enjoys acting as Junghyeok, doesn’t he? xD"
49,"May 26, 2021","Huiwon and Dokja are too similar, please someone come get the two of them. They’re having way too much fun with this "
49,"May 19, 2021",IM SORRY I GOT A SCREENSHOT DETECTED BUT I JUST WANTED A PICTURE OF HOT DOKJA SAYING KNEEL IM SO SORRY TT
49,"Apr 7, 2021","Puts her in charge of making sure nothing weird gets out of hand. Immediately she gets in a fight instead of just saying ""our leader is here for negotiations"" lmao."
49,"May 19, 2021","Yes, we're all attracted to/embarrassed for Dokja and his role-playing, but Huiwon is really getting into it too lmao 🤣 "
49,"Apr 7, 2021",This is like when you watch an anime till the end and loved it and then somebody tells you about how they just stopped half way in lol
49,"Apr 9, 2021",damn that scene where dokja said kneel... that was hot
49,"Apr 7, 2021","Wow, compared to Dokja, that “prophet” is such a noob."
49,"Apr 7, 2021",I feel so bad for Donghoon in his little L pose. He looks fragile and so exhausted. 
49,"Apr 22, 2021","When he said kneel , he look like bottom want to be top"
49,"May 26, 2021",“I’m addicted to smartphones” aren’t we all 
49,"Apr 7, 2021",There were a total of 3149 episodes and the viewer count dropped to 12 viewers by chapter 50 I didn’t see anything about how far along those readers got by the 12 disciples of TWSA don’t have nothing on my boy Dokja at all
49,"May 26, 2021",Can we just talk about how Dokja gives off this diva energy half the time?
49,"Apr 30, 2021",Like that <The Prophets> are being shamed by the Author as Renouncers. Didn't appreciate his work? You get the shame stick.
49,"May 26, 2021",I'm pretending to be someone else but KNEEL PEASANT. fckin power move 😂
49,"May 16, 2021", I'm obsessed with Dokja's legs fjxjdjxsjvus and I'm crying because I cannot take screenshots in these chapters (//⌣̀_⌣/́/)
49,"Apr 7, 2021","Don’t mess with Huiwon, she’ll mess you up!"
49,"May 26, 2021","""WHY DO YOU KEEP PLAYING WITH YOUR PHONE?? "" ""I-I'm sorry I'm just addicted to smartphones"" 
Every parent and kid conversation ever"
49,"May 27, 2021",This is like trying to lie about what’s in the Bible to Jesus 
49,"May 26, 2021",Computer kid is literally L from deathnote
49,"May 26, 2021","Dokja: ""Kneel""Me: Yes daddy sir
"
49,"May 26, 2021","Theory: There's a term in drama where the ""fourth wall"" means the invisible wall between the actors and the audience. So maybe since he's a ""reader"", the fourth wall makes him mentally be the ""audience"" and makes him view things like they are in a novel. Also makes sense how he is so mentally stable when everyone else is collapsed on the ground. Cause he's like an audience watching the novel/show go on."
49,"May 26, 2021",WTF DOKJA IS HOT 😭
49,"Apr 7, 2021",Dokja is just built different.
49,"May 27, 2021",Dokja has literally gone from wimpy introvert office worker to mildly toxic extroverted chad and I love it 😂 
49,"May 26, 2021","lmaooo they changed it to ""renouncer"" instead of ""nth to get off"" (probably for the best lol)"
49,"Apr 7, 2021",I like how Dokja only spend his money when he needs to. Now how are you a prophet but you don’t get your own revelation but get it from a book you can barely read? He probably was one of the readers who stop reading story early on so only knows the beginning story. 
49,"Apr 7, 2021",Heewon is about to end that man's entire career. 
49,"May 26, 2021","10/10 acting there, junghyeok would totally cross his legs like that, yep"
49,"May 26, 2021",dokja really pulled up behind him like you got games on yo phone
49,"Apr 7, 2021","This man really not worth Dokja’s time, if he was the 9th person to stop reading, he didn’t even get past chapter 2. Assuming the book is the same as the web novel, in chapter one if says the first chapter of twsa had 1,202 views, and the second chapter had 950 views LOL"
49,"May 26, 2021",I miss the constellation comments 😞
49,"May 26, 2021","Dokja: Huiwon what do you have?She: A knife!!
Dokja: No!!! 
XD"
49,"May 26, 2021","Me:""I would NEVER kneel for anyone in my entire life."" Dokja: KNEEL Me:""Yes my lord I will kiss the floor and your feet for you."""
49,"May 28, 2021","I'D KNEEL BEFORE HIM, YES, I'M A DOKJA SIMP."
49,"May 27, 2021","I always start to think ""Dokja is a very normal well adjusted man"" and then he does some shit like KNEEL"
49,"May 26, 2021","I like Dokja not because he is op and awesome, but because he spent freaking 5000 coins just to see what a guy was reading on a phone 👌"
49,"May 26, 2021",He should learn to fear the homosexual supporting cast
49,"May 26, 2021","Dokja is really into this Junghyuk Yu impression act. Also we finally have some good info about these so called ""Prophets"". And looks like they're all keeping in touch via a group chat, or maybe atleast some of them are. If I remember well, everyone except Dokja stopped reading at chapter 50, so how are these Prophets planning to tackle the scenarios that come after that?"
49,"May 27, 2021",Dokja is kinda hot ain't he? 
49,"May 27, 2021","Oh I thought it was the whole world experiencing this, not just the capital cities. People who couldn't afford to live there must be real greatful rn"
49,"May 26, 2021","“Comment manipulation lv.3"",“Keyboard attack lv.3"" lmaoo"
49,"Apr 7, 2021",So you telling me this 17-year-old  introvert has completed over  half of the KINGS PATH...... damn 
49,"May 26, 2021",man dokja simps must be going over the moon when he said 'Kneel.' ngl it WAS pretty hot >/////<
49,"Apr 8, 2021","""And then I just started stabbing."""
49,"Apr 8, 2021",I just love Huiwon and Dokja. 
49,"May 20, 2021",This is my first fast pass here. This story is so addictive 😭
49,"May 26, 2021",TEN ways to survive apocalypse??? Wasn't it 3 ?
49,"May 27, 2021","dokja: ""kneel""  my simping ass: ""yes sir!!!"" "
49,"May 27, 2021","""why is he bowing too?"" BECAUSE HES A CUTE HIMBO THATS WHY"
49,"May 26, 2021","I falling in love with heewon more and more after every chapter ,she's so badass and funny and also the whole ""majesty thing "" dokja and heewon seem to be enjoying this while hyunsung being confused is so cute ,and you don't mess with queen heewon 😍😘"
49,"May 27, 2021",Dokja really be like yOu GoT gAmEs On YoUr PhOnE?
49,"May 27, 2021","Waiting for all the ""is that L?"" comments 😂"
49,"May 28, 2021",The absolute bad bitch energy Dokja drips is impeccable 🤌🏽
49,"May 27, 2021",constellations have been awfully quiet in this episode...
49,"May 26, 2021",huiwon's bored expression oh my god i love her
49,"May 26, 2021","why tf does dokja look so aggressive asking about why the guy was looking at his phone 😂😂 and the ""I'm sorry I'm addicted to smartphones"" 💀 ADJSNS"
49,"May 26, 2021",You know what? I live for Huiwon handing out some juicy ass beatings so I don't mind this (ps: HA! If only they knew Dokja is THE prophet)
49,"May 28, 2021",HOLD UP HOLD UP HOLD UP!!! Those chat messages... are you trying to tell me that this apocalypse ISN'T happening on a world-wide scale????? The world capitals have been put in bubbles? Are there actually still people in this world leading regular lives while all this insanity is going on!??!?!?
49,"May 27, 2021","huiwon really like ""who tf you callin a side character bitch"""
49,"May 26, 2021","That guy on computer, by look he reminded me of L from Death note combined with Ethen from Haedcore leveling warior"
49,"May 26, 2021",I love huiwon she is both powerful and funny the perfect ally😆
49,"May 26, 2021",why is L here?
49,"May 28, 2021","Whether you find it hot or ridiculous, remembering that this is Dokja’s Jonghyeok Yu impression really adds something to that scene lol"
49,"May 28, 2021",lmao he was the only one reading 1000 chapters and they call themselves prophets
49,"May 26, 2021",this whole episode was about a cosplayer bullying a group of larpers 
49,"May 26, 2021",Dokja is such a drama I love him

49,"May 28, 2021",when he said kneel... I felt something 😳
49,"May 26, 2021",feel so chilling in that split panel of dokja and huiwon with their cold expressions like some badass 
49,"May 26, 2021",Yo I really hope an apocalypse does not start after the story is finished
49,"May 26, 2021",Huiwon's a mood!
49,"May 26, 2021","Dokja: “Kneel.” Me: yes, sir. Anything for you, sir. 😗"
49,"May 26, 2021",“KNEEL” ... yes 🧎‍♀️
49,"May 26, 2021",dokja: i need to earn more money 🤔 also dokja: *spends 5000 coins just to walk behind  that guy* 😀
49,"May 26, 2021",Moral : never leave a book unfinished.
49,"May 26, 2021",Heewon is the best improv partner you could ever have
49,"May 26, 2021","My queen huiwon, If huiwon ask me to kneel to her I will do it. This my queeen"

49,"May 26, 2021",Why did the puppet remind me of L from Death Note
49,"May 13, 2021",heewon totally into that majesty thing 😂
49,"Apr 9, 2021","Prediction: Dokja or Yu is the author. If Yu, he knew he'd need people like this, regressed, wrote the novel... but who knows if he even remembers setting it up? If Dokja, man, who knows? He knew he'd have to write it to survive. Given Yu's existence, the (actual) prophets and Dokja's own powers, who knows what sort of time travel fuckery is going on here. (Note: This publication of this comic is the only version of this I've read, no spoilers please... Just speculating.)"
49,"Apr 8, 2021","Dokja pretending to be MC : bitch I don’t need you, I gotta the one person who read the whole damn thing!"

49,"May 27, 2021",[The Constellation A Strange Dreamer cries as she rummages through her moth eaten wallet for precious coins to sponsor]
49,"May 27, 2021",For a second I almost kneeled down when he said that😀
49,"May 27, 2021","Dokja here spending 5000 coins like nothing just to see what that guy was reading and here I am unable to spend 5 coins to read the next episode, shame on me"
49,"May 27, 2021",*Dokja gets introduced to the “leader”* Dokja: Where’d he get the bed?
49,"May 27, 2021","I feel as though, as the series goes on less and less people will read this tale.. leading to a similar outcome of the novel and then BOOM! We have to live this comic. (jk on the last part)"
49,"May 27, 2021",Why read Omniscient Reader: We have our own “L”
49,"May 26, 2021",The whole ep was funny 😆
49,"May 26, 2021","This ""non supporting cast"" can whoop your ass mister."

49,"May 26, 2021",Dokja: KNEELMe: *not having a second thought*
49,"May 26, 2021","So if these guys stopped reading, does that make Dokja the king of the prophets?"
49,"May 26, 2021",“Renouncer” I was wondering how or if “those who got off” would be translated otherwise I’d be a laughing mess
49,"May 26, 2021","Dokja's expressions in some of the panels, like the ""Look at him go."" and the ""WHY DO YOU KEEP PLAYING WITH YOUR PHONE?"" panels are amazing."
49,"May 26, 2021",ok dokja u dont have to say it twice for me to kneel- JKJK I JUST WANTED TO TRY SAYING THAT LMAO
49,"May 14, 2021","I guess Renouncer is better than ""Someone Who Got Off"" (novel translation) since its not suggestive? 😂👌"
49,"Apr 8, 2021",the first black guy I see and Huiwon kills him 😂😂😂
49,"Apr 8, 2021",I bet he will try to recruit the kid who is mind controlled because of being important to the novel 
49,"Apr 7, 2021","This is only happening in Capitols?!? Makes some sense, I guess. More entertainment potential. I wonder if the domes will expand or shatter? It seems like the prophets have some interest in gaining power with people outside... "
49,"Apr 7, 2021",KIM DOKJA YOU'RE SUCH A GIRLBOSS
49,"Oct 17, 2021",THAT KNEEL PANEL ....TAKE ME

49,"Jun 20, 2021",wow WHY DOES HE LOOK LIKE L?!?!!?? 
49,"Jun 2, 2021",L is that you?
49,"May 30, 2021",I loooove Huiwon and Dokja’s dynamic they’re hilarious
49,"May 29, 2021",Coincidence that Dokja and Daddy start with the letter D? I think the tf not 
49,"May 28, 2021",THE 'Kneel' PANEL WAS SOOOO SEXYYYY (And a little bit embrassing🧍🏻‍♀️)
49,"May 28, 2021",Dokja’s boldness never cease to surprise me I’m more scared for him than he is for himself like seriously how can he pretend to be someone and not just anyone but the main character who’s the strongest just like that with so much confidence and without even sweating 😂
49,"May 28, 2021",I love how Dokja can successfully bs his way through things it’s big brain move

49,"May 27, 2021",I love how the guy put it in such a fancy way to basically mean he stopped reading TWSA because it just wasn’t a story for him to stick around on and Dokja can just call out his bs 😂
49,"May 27, 2021","Huiwon and dojka give off the same vibes and I’mHere for it Ik their not siblings but she gets the assignment and gets the job done I’ve Offically dubbed them as adopted bro and sis cuz they are just too op with eachother, best sibling duo ever
"
49,"May 27, 2021","shout out to all basement dwellers out there, your king has been revealed and he is cute ngl."
49,"May 27, 2021","Can we just talk bout the way he crossed his legs and said ""kneel""reminded me of Levi Ackerman"
49,"May 27, 2021","dokja sitting with crossed legs and saying ""kneel""...... "
49,"May 27, 2021",Dokja’s snarky internal comments are everything
49,"May 26, 2021","when he said ""I'm addicted to smartphones"", I felt that."
49,"May 26, 2021",Dokja being like. I've memorized the entire book get on my level lmao
49,"May 26, 2021",the kid in the chair reminded me of L. 
49,"May 26, 2021",Dokja spending 5k coins just to see his phone is like the kid thats always peeking at your phone if ya got any games....

49,"May 26, 2021",Man wen I first saw tech guy I thought that L from deathnote was making a cameo 😂
49,"May 26, 2021",Heewon bowing down to Dokja and Hyunsung doing the same is so funny
49,"May 26, 2021",i’d kneel for dokj- LEMME STOP THERE

49,"Apr 8, 2021",Dokja must have also read Noblesse.

49,"Apr 7, 2021",“ALL HAIL KING DOKJA!” 🤣
49,"Apr 7, 2021",Ok but the “kneel” part really started to look like a porno for a sec there
49,"Apr 7, 2021",Huiwon not taking shit from anybody
49,"May 28, 2021","Dokja is so funny I love his character. And I love Huiwon so much she's so funny. I definitely ship them. I love how she was 110% ready for the pretend role about Dokja being Jonghyeok and keeps joking by calling him ""Majesty."" She's such a fire cracker and I love her 😂💕 And damn Dokja does a great job impersonating Jonghyeok Yu. Like, he should have attempted to be an actor before this happened. 🤭  He's a bad bitch. His entire squad is a bad bitch tbh."
49,"May 26, 2021","ok that ""kneel"" is hot. 😶 "
49,"Apr 7, 2021","....Who in the hell read the most chapters, beside our main boy here. Also, steal the phone so we know what the group chat is about."

49,"May 27, 2021","Up to now seriously, they still not edited the ""10 wys to survive the apocalypse""? 😂. It should be only ""3 Ways... "" 🤣"
49,"May 27, 2021","Just started reading the webnovel after starting this, now I'm on chapter 309 and I can't wait to see where the webtoon goes. The webnovel is amazing, but the art and expressions in the webtoon really bring it to life."
49,"May 27, 2021","""Junghyeok Yu might have cried if he heard this"" 🤣🤣🤣 Lmfao that's something I'd like to see. (Not wait, not in a creepy way I just thought it would be funny to see him cry since he acts all buff, don't misunderstand I'm not a creep . . . at least not for now)"
49,"May 27, 2021",So he was the ninth person to stop reading 🤔 He probably came for the free coins.

49,"May 26, 2021",Absolutely loving Huiwon playing along with Dokja’s YJH in such a hilariously over the top manner
49,"May 26, 2021",DOKJA IS REALLY HOT HOLY CRAP... I ALMOST DIED WHEN HE SAID “KNEEL” OMG-
49,"May 26, 2021","Dokja: “Ah yes you have a book of prophecies, weird how that works, wonder what it says??? Wouldn’t it be great if someone had actually read the whole thing????”"
49,"May 26, 2021",Hyungsung is so cute ❤️😂 (that is his name right? Sorry if it's not 🙏) 
49,"May 26, 2021",Meanwhile L calmly chatting in the internet to know about the Prophets so he can learn their real names and write it in a Death Note and is being casually ignored in the background when all this chaos is happening 
49,"May 26, 2021",Dokja: You got games on your phone?

49,"Jun 4, 2021",“Why do you keep playing with your phone??” Bruh i feel very attacked

49,"May 27, 2021","Nooo, all the 'one who got off' jokes I was going to make... On a separate note, 'renouncer' as a change in translation actually sounds really cool, and much less awkward than 'one who got off. This is actually a pretty good translation change. On another separate note, there are three ways to survive in a ruined world, not 10- translation error"
49,"May 27, 2021",You can't convince me that that kid isn't L 😂
49,"May 27, 2021",That Mr. Han looks like L from death note. 
49,"May 27, 2021","As a switch when he said ""kneel"", it appealed to both sides of me 😏"

49,"May 27, 2021","Goodbye fellow brown man, I’m sorry but I don’t think that you’ll see tomorrow "

49,"Jun 1, 2021","even if there are those ""prophets"" they still can't hold a candle to Dokja. He read the whole thing and is smart enough to use his knowledge to analyse and strengthen. I mean, look at the gap between him and this other guy. Even his name is an mc name type. And that panel when that guy was glued to his phone even when ""Junghyeok Yu"" was shouting at him lmao relatable"
49,"Jun 1, 2021",this story taught me to finish every book i read to be ready in any conflict that may happen

49,"May 30, 2021",Did she just mess things up?also I'm laughing so hard bc he stopped reading so quickly
49,"May 29, 2021","one of the things i like in omniscient reader is the skills. Usually in novels/manga/manhwa stories, the skills you see are magic, shield, or other typical fantasy-like things. While in ORV there are skills like ""lacking presence"", ""keyboard attack"", ""small eater"" etc. Also here is a tiny tiny spoiler.... in the future you'll see someone with a skill called ""self loathing"" lol. Hope the translator doesn't change that XD"
49,"May 29, 2021",Donghoon’s skills 😂😂😂 “small eater” lol “LACKING PRESENCE” LMAO
49,"May 29, 2021",Dokja telling him to kneel and I can bet 20 bucks half of us almost did along with the other guy-

49,"Dec 15, 2021","I can feel the dislike Dokja have towards 'the prophets'. Don't you just hate the people that have to leave comments hating on your favorite book/character before they drop it and never touch it again. It's futile to argue with them. Yet it's just unfair because they don't even understand the character or the book, and their comments will work to turn new readers away."

49,"May 21, 2022","I just love the little details, like the fact that teenagers seem to be the ones that are able to thrive the most. Any kids we meet will either be dead (dead inside included), or really fuckin strong, no in-betweens. This would be because the world is a game now. High-stakes, sure; but still a game. A world where those adapt to rpgs will know what to do. It’s just a neat little thing that teenagers seem to have such polarizing positions heheh"

49,"May 27, 2021","Renouncer... is good if you haven't read the novel, but a horrible translation if you've read the novel. It won't make sense later in context. No one renounced the novel, they just stopped reading. Stick with ""Got off"", and go read the novel, translator-nim. After the ""returnee"" and ""transmission"" fiasco, it's clear you haven't, and it's a huge disservice to fans of this series."
49,"May 27, 2021",my friend mirrors said this is pog!
49,"May 27, 2021",This renouncer is about to eat his words. And concrete
49,"May 27, 2021",i know I am two months late to the party a d those who read the nocel already know it but: Dokja could just reveal himself a d make them all his minions right. Theyd easily crawl before the one who read all.

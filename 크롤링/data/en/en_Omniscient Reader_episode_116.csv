116,"Aug 3, 2022","What a chapter man...we get Persephone looking like Sangah (and hot af might I add), we got her licking her lips, her having gold eyes, and we find out that there are still things even he doesn't know. That begs the question...does that mean even the author doesn't know EVERYTHING and just wrote about things they DO know in order to help the reader (Dokja)? "

116,"Aug 3, 2022","so I guess he's changed the story so much that the world of the book no longer exist and is now more like a compass and map. it points and shows his world, but no longer gives him infinite knowledge over everything covered in the map"

116,"Aug 4, 2022","i see many comments said it's because Dokja changed the story so much. keep in mind that TWSA is 3000+ chapters and it contains YJH's rounds of regression. that means YJH repeated the scenarios sooo many times, and there's so much variations of clearing the scenarios and a very broad knowledge to the world itself. So yes, Dokja obviously changed things in this 3rd round, but what he did is just another variation (let's say it's what YJH from the novel did in his 8th round,13rd, or else)."
116,"Aug 3, 2022",And that's when Dokja realized he just might've bitten off more than he can chew

116,"Aug 9, 2022",Finished the novel today. Started the novel on May 19 2021. I didn't really think I would take one year to finish the novel but it was really a great journey! I enjoyed every bit of the story like a constellation lol. But it was really great. Thank you author-nim for creating such a story. I loved it to the very end ‚ù§
116,"Aug 3, 2022","considering he'a changed the story to the point where he is in the 5th scenario, who knows how much a character he saved in the first episode will change the futur and events in the next days"
116,"Aug 3, 2022",oh buddy... you got a big storm coming..... so glad we're getting to the real meat of the story *crowd laughs*
116,"Aug 3, 2022",if you notice how dokja says that stories arent linear than that could imply dokja wrote a story to his past self in hopes of improving him in the future?

116,"Sep 7, 2022","orv certainly knows how to build suspense and fear. despite having read this in the novel already, chills went down my spine when Persephone said ""it's their story"". entire lives and experiences and memories reduced to meat for the enjoyment of the constellations. it makes you hate the constellations even more. and the censor, man. dokja realising that there's more to this world than he thought hits so hard. genuine kudos to the artists for the art this chapter (honestly, for all of them) "
116,"Sep 7, 2022",The Constellations are story fanatics who support their favorites by throwing coins at them. Why do I feel called out?
116,"Aug 3, 2022",my dumbass would've absolutely eaten that food 
116,"Sep 7, 2022","Kind of Arrogant of Dokja to assume that he knows everything within the universe of TWSA when he didn't even write the story to begin with. TWSA was GIVEN to him. The only natural question, then, should be ""By whom?"" Because he STILL has no clue who the author is by this point, and he definitely shouldn't assume that the author is the only power player above the constellations."

116,"Aug 3, 2022",Huh so there's parts of the TWSO lore he doesn't know. I guess that means that the author didn't get to cover some important things.

116,"Aug 3, 2022",Dokja realizing that this story goes.much further than the book. Especially with him derailing it.
116,"Aug 3, 2022","There is always a point in Fanfics that when a reader goes into a world they are familiar with there is what I call a tipping point, where all there efforts to change the plot take effect, but at the cost of them losing the information that would happen and be replaced by something else.

116,"Aug 3, 2022",I'm so glad that they finally use '‚ñ†' for the filtering üò≠
116,"Sep 7, 2022","So what Dokja‚Äôs probably experiencing is when an author sets up a plot device mid story, but moves on & forgets to address it or explain it entirely. Parts of TWSA were incomplete. That‚Äôs probably why so many people dropped it. Sometimes you notice it as a reader, or you forget the author was even trying to set up something to begin with cause it wasn‚Äôt explained. That‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt have all the info even though he read the story- cause it was never given to the readers in the first place üòÆ"
116,"Aug 4, 2022",I am actually glad that there is missing information. Keeps things spicy.

116,"Sep 8, 2022","Oh my gosh. I got chills reading this chapter from just how beautiful it was. The art is always extremely well-done and the backgrounds have been some of the best I've seen, but this chaoter especially is amazing, and the pacing and suspence and use of color even more. But the biggest chills I got was reading that Dokja doesn't even know everything."

116,"Sep 8, 2022","We have finally reached this point of the story where he meets Persephone. I absolutely loved this scene with how it was drawn and described :) Though what I was most happy abt is‚Ä¶ the FACT THEY USED THE TERM ‚ÄúSTORY‚Äù instead of ‚Äúfable‚Äù, which I hadn‚Äôt heard in a long time in the English translation.

116,"Sep 7, 2022","What is a man? Just a miserable pile of stories.
Not too surprised there‚Äôs something Dokja doesn‚Äôt know. Even with a story as drawn out as TWSA, there‚Äôs gotta be a few things that the author thought up but didn‚Äôt put into the published story."

116,"Aug 3, 2022","HAPPY BIRTHDAY YOO JOONGHYUK MY LOVEEEEEEE ‚ô°W‚ô° ‚ú®
Ok, I've always pondered what Dokja meant with that ""Time doesn't only move forward, thought you would know""... i couldn't find to which part of Persephone's myth it could refer to, anyone knows?

Also, there's a LOT of foreshadowing in ORV and I had forgotten Persephone said that here and Dokja didn't know the info yet, IDK what that is all about but I'm pretty sure the answer is in the future (and it might be one of those things that hurt my ‚ô°)"
116,"Aug 3, 2022",Can we all just take a moment to appreciate this Webtoon? Thanks Singnsong and Sleepy-c!!!!! Don‚Äôt forget to like the chapter!

116,"Sep 7, 2022",Persephone looking sangah is so hot I gasped the whole chapter

heck thers some incarnations who know he can do that
how are you a god and dont know? did you really just ignore everything up until now?"

116,"Aug 3, 2022",damn this is gonna shake him up a little bit and us lol the twsa author is probably adding more to the novel as its a reality or its known information that he's going to have to dig deep on.
116,"Sep 9, 2022",How does she know so much about Korean men? Well she's been watching too much kdrama before the scenarios started ofc. Stories are still stories. And kdramas got a huge variety 
116,"Sep 8, 2022","So TWSA is someone's (presumably the [Secretive Plotter]'s ""story""? And Dokja reading the webnovel was him consuming it?"
116,"Sep 8, 2022",What? Wow even Dokja isn‚Äôt aware of everything in the novel he has consistently read! This was a dope chapter üëçüî•
116,"Sep 8, 2022",I have a Theorie: The Autor of TWSA is someone who also was in the TWSA storie and after he got out of there he wrote evrything down what he knows

116,"Sep 7, 2022",Now that's interesting! I wasn't expecting anything would be censored to Dokja. Maybe there are short stories connected to TWSA that Dokja never discovered and thereby didn't read?
116,"Aug 4, 2022",Well I‚Äôm screwed. I watched all the free pass episodes and I‚Äôm out of money. See ya when I see ya.
116,"Aug 3, 2022","Well duh, by changing the outcome of the scenarios you created new ones that didn‚Äôt exist in the novel. You knew this when you destroyed the throne you Î∞±Ïπò"

116,"Sep 8, 2022","Off hand thought, but what if Dokja was the author? With all the, time is not linear stuff, what if this is a sort of loop where dokja becomes the author and this is all a ploy by him to change stuff for a brighter future? Probably not, but it‚Äôs an interesting thought."
116,"Sep 7, 2022",How does it feel when you know better than Kim Dokja this time Novel reader/reader that's already known information about this? ‚¨õ‚¨õ‚¨õüòäüòâ Tbh‚Äã I'm both sure and not sure but I'm excited to know more

There's def something more going on here and that ""‚ñ†"" thing is prob linked to this. My theory is the author didn't write about everything that is going on in the story. The constellations and all of that were real and since time doesn't necessarily move forward maybe the author just wrote what would happen to Earth and you read it and it changed the story."
116,"Sep 7, 2022",not dokja asking to look at the old lady he watched die a horrible death instead of sanghah just cause she's in a hotter outfit LOLL
116,"Sep 7, 2022","Theory: Remember the girl who supposedly plagiarized TWSA? Maybe she has the info on the scenario, because she technically wrote the entire thing as well. Just slightly differently. Probably means the two books are intertwining."

116,"Sep 7, 2022","My guess is that she just mentioned the author of TWSA... but if that info really was about a future scenario, then that means TWSA has a sequel Dokja doesn't know about "

116,"Sep 12, 2022",can someone spoil it to me i beg
116,"Sep 11, 2022","no because this makes sense, the book has the protagonist as Junghyeok, the whole book of Twsa only explains what the author writes as a setting and Junghyeok's AND other main characters experiences. He wouldn't have known all of the insight's between the constellations. Maybe this would be unlocked if a character of Twsa is in this situation with Dokja"
116,"Sep 11, 2022","Well, to be fair, the creators of TWSA would need to have access to the event to understand it.  "

Episode,Date,Review
32,"Dec 9, 2020",i love the fact that jonghyuk can only be this petty with dokja
32,"Dec 9, 2020",The interactions between Dokja and Gilyeong are too wholesome even if Dokja is a hypocrite. Father figures for the win!
32,"Dec 9, 2020",‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna die‚Äù *proceeds to die*
32,"Dec 9, 2020","you know, I thought of Dokja as a likeable raging sociopath a few episodes back, but he literally just effectively sacrificed his own safety to keep Gilyeong safe. maybe he's got a ploy, maybe he doesn't. But maybe I need to reconsider my opinion of the guy because no matter what way you spin it, that's a pretty heroic action. To put it another way, I really enjoy the depth of his character. I can't predict him, I hardly trust him, yet I'm constantly rooting for him. This series is really good."
32,"Dec 9, 2020",The Lion the witch and the audacity of this Bit*h 
32,"Dec 9, 2020",I find it interesting that Junghyeok Yu was even willing to take Gileong
32,"Dec 9, 2020",Adults in this story: BuT wHy WoNt YoU hElP mE???? iT's NoT fAir!!!!!Child in the story: you can leave us behind. You'd do a lot better.
32,"Dec 9, 2020","Yu Joonghyuk and Kim Dokja are like a divorced couple with Gilyoung as their child. And little Gilyoung can't belive that his beloved daddy forced him to stay with the insufferable father. I mean, look at Gilyoung's face when Dokja passed him to Joonghyuk"
32,"Dec 9, 2020",I love how dokja is the only guy that can get jongyhuk or however his name is spelled to do anything outside his comfort zone XD.... and this is just a theory but I'm starting to suspect that this might be a new round for him that isnt in the book.
32,"Dec 9, 2020",I love for Daddy Dokja and Baby Gilyeong moments. They give me life.
32,"Dec 9, 2020",I forgot how much of an ass jonghyuk can be üíÄ
32,"Dec 9, 2020",I love how Dokja replied back ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna die‚Äù after reading his mind lol
32,"Jan 27, 2021","""Take the kid"" ""Give me the child"" pls are they divorced parents or sum-"
32,"Jan 1, 2021","""... I once read a novel that went to shit because the protagonist did that"", btw he read all the novelü§°"
32,"Dec 9, 2020",atleast he accepted the kid
32,"Dec 9, 2020",The cliffhangers in this novel is deadlier then covid. I dont think my heart can take it.
32,"Dec 9, 2020","Junghyeok Yu will never trust Dokja, this is another test I'm sure of it. But I still can't get over the fact Dokja cares the most about Gilyeong, his new lil brother. "
32,"Jan 6, 2021","Dear translators, Please let the characters use honorifics for each other. And please let LGY call KDJ 'hyung'. I think most of the novel and webtoon readers would be grateful if you do so. I actually love this story. It is very close to me. So, please please let them use honorifics. Thank you."
32,"Dec 9, 2020","please let lgy call kdj ""hyung"" for star stream's sake"
32,"Jan 23, 2021","""I'm definitely not meant to be a protagonist. I'll never be a hero or a savior but... Gilyeong will not die. At least not today."" HOOLLLLLLY SHIT SORRY I CANT HEAR U OVER MY LOUD ASS SOBBING üò≠üíñ YALL PLZ DOKJA HAS ALWAYS BEEN PRETTY MORALLY GRAY BUT LOOK AT THIS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT I CAN NOTTTT ALSO HOLY SHIT PLZ THE PLOT TWIST OF JEONGHYUK BEING IN THE GREEN ZONE TOOK ME OUT I WAS NOT PREPAREDDDD THIS WAS SUCH A GOOD CHAPTER AND IT WAS SO WORTH MY LAST COINS üëèü§ßüíñüíã"
32,"Dec 9, 2020","That was the moment for me, when Dokja said that the kid not gonna die. You are my man!"
32,"Dec 10, 2020",can I fast pass the fast pass please...
32,"Jan 27, 2021","in the webnovel, Gilyeong uses ""hyung"" to call Dokja and I know this has something to do with the translation but everytime he calls him hyung it just hits different"
32,"Dec 9, 2020",I have been wrong for damn near every plan of action I've predicted and I love it
32,"Dec 9, 2020","Constellation ""Herald of the Black Dawn"" is choosing not to regret buying coins to spend here. *tossed in another 5 coins*"
32,"Dec 9, 2020",[THE CONSTELLATION WEBTOON READER THROWS A TANTRUM AT THE CLIFF-HANGER AND EAGERLY AWAITS THE NEXT CHAPTER.]
32,"Dec 9, 2020",we all know he isn't going to die with that said I still need to see proof he survived. #PleaseSurviveDokja
32,"Dec 9, 2020",another week of agony...
32,"Jan 27, 2021","""at least take this kid then"" ""give me the child"" = my parents agreeing on custody"
32,"Dec 9, 2020",Awkward moment when you see a new episode of omicient reader and you still have coins but you try hard to resist just to remember you bought those coins for this webtoon anyways
32,"Jan 27, 2021","lmao when Yoo Jonghyuk just chillin on his green zone, had got me"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Dokja and Jonghyuk acting like parents
32,"Jan 27, 2021",It‚Äôs official. Dokja is Gilyeong‚Äôs dad. And that‚Äôs final. 
32,"Jan 27, 2021",It's wierd how the main character isn't the main character
32,"Jan 27, 2021","As usual, Kim Dokja is suicidal üòÖ "
32,"Dec 9, 2020",I just realized that the kid and dokja are the main team because in the prologue there togheter 
32,"Jan 27, 2021","""I'm definitely not meant to be a protagonist"" he says, as the definite protagonist of this story"
32,"Jan 10, 2021",I read the comments and I agree that YJH indeed took the room and Gilyoung because it both helps him to find out more about KDJ(since he can't read him at all) and seperate Gilyoung from KDJ's party so he can talk to him alone later
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Feel sorry for that one dude that got his green zone pulled out from under him by the flying white furball. 
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Sometimes gilyeong says things that make me wonder about what he was like before all of that happened.
32,"Jan 27, 2021",So he said he wouldn‚Äôt die because the penalty on the screen didn‚Äôt say it was death? Smart. Time for him to scam anther dokkebai.
32,"Jan 27, 2021","They both just like protect the cinnamon roll at all costs. ""Take the kid."" ""Give me the child."" Ha haaaa! That was so funny."
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Dokja really only shows his true feelings when he's pissed at Junghyeok
32,"Jan 28, 2021","As much as I love how petty Dokja and Junghyuk are with each other, it was kinda nice to see them both agree to keep Gilyeong safe"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",I gonna riot if that kid dies that is practically his son at this point 
32,"Jan 27, 2021","sure both dokja and junghyeok can be petty narcissists, but at least they're good to best boy gilyeong"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Safe zones are green. Some of the monsters have green eyes. Conclusion: poke em in the eyes
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Ah yes. Dokja and his self sacrificing sht again- Is he ever going to stop I swear-
32,"Jan 27, 2021","Out of the webtoons here, personally this has the best anime potential.. i haven't been able to predict sht since this dropped"
32,"Jan 30, 2021","I love how honest he is about himself because that's how humans are. Like he's not a villain or hero and he doesn't claim nor act like one. He tries to preserve himself, but also realize he has bonded with his group so he doesn't want them to die either. Also Gilyeong is very perceptive it's scary because he knows that Dokja can get places faster without the group, but honestly yeah that may be true but he would never get far without them."
32,"Jan 27, 2021","""With great power comes the great urge to do petty shit"" -some dude in the webtoon comment section"
32,"Jan 30, 2021",I want the battery his phone has.
32,"Jan 29, 2021","Dokja's relationship with Gilyeong is so wholesome. No matter what you can say about Dokja, you can't ignore how amazing he is for taking Gilyeong in, not ditching him, and keeping the kid safe even if it means it might kill him in the process."
32,"Jan 28, 2021","I can‚Äôt tell if Gilyeong is naturally a logical and level-headed person or if the trauma of this whole apocalyptic world has made him cut off his emotions, but either way I absolutely love his character. There are many stories with a girl or kid who‚Äôs hella annoying and in general a huge burden but stays for the obvious reason that they‚Äôre cute or whatever. However Gilyeong is a rare treasure, he understands things that many of the others don‚Äôt, and he tries his hardest to be helpful to Dokja."
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Omg their father-son relationship is gonna make my heart burst ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
32,"Jan 22, 2021",when you get touched with how the will dokja protect gilyoung but then suddenly tear up to see how jerk jonghyuk make dokja have to suffer again after thrown up inside monster before üò´
32,"Dec 9, 2020",I straight up paused my anime binging (2nd season hoping there's a third this is freaking amazing) to come straight hereand there's already almost a 100 of you... stay vigilant you brave comic warriors. 
32,"Jan 27, 2021","Ok but like, low blow man. He‚Äôs with a kid in his arms, I realize he‚Äôs annoying but maybe pick another time?? "
32,"Jan 29, 2021","""I'm definitely not meant to be a protagonist"" said the protagonist"
32,"Jan 28, 2021",Dokja: Ima come back and spit on your shoes.
32,"Jan 28, 2021",dokja has the most strangest personality i‚Äôve ever seen from a webtoon
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Dokja and Gilyeong's interactions makes my heart soft ü•∫ Gilyeong looks up to Dokja so much. And Dokja stops at nothing to protect him ü•∫
32,"Jan 27, 2021","....I think his chapter douse a lot to show us Dokja mindset more. That yes, he can do this alone...but in a way, he doesn't want to.  HE wants to keep at least some people close to him. He is trying to learn from the mistakes Jonghyuk. He is trying to be better. He is trying to stay 'human' in his own way."
32,"Jan 28, 2021","Jonghyuk changed his fate out of pettiness, that‚Äôs what amazing writing is üëå"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",DOKJA IS JUST A SINGLE DAD TRYING TO RAISE HIS 10YO KID 
32,"Jan 27, 2021","So, Dokja read his mind and said, ""I'm not gonna die."" Won't that make this already perturbed person even more cautious?"
32,"Jan 21, 2021","I know many other people have said this before, and I‚Äôm going to join right in. I love Gilyeong and Dokja‚Äôs relationship üòå It reminds me of a little brother and big brother dynamic. And seeing Gilyeong hide behind Dokja and Dokja ruffling his hair üò≠"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",he'll be fineee plot armor am I right *sweats nervously*
32,"Jan 28, 2021","Dokja after this please adopt Gilyeong! Also I'm glad that Jonghyuk took Gilyeong, but Dokja if you die I'll haunt you for eternity and I'm not kidding so don't try it"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",yall ever just read really fast then get sad when its alr done so you reread the same ep again like 5 times to appreciate all the little details üßç
32,"Jan 27, 2021",dokja and gilyeong are my favourite father-son duo ever
32,"Jan 27, 2021",but you guys we're forgetting one thing: this scenario lasts for a whole damn week!
32,"Jan 28, 2021",*laughs in novel reader*

32,"Jan 23, 2021",I spent 5 coins just to see if they survive and end up on another cliff hanger. I don't think I'll survive the next 2 weeks.

32,"Dec 10, 2020","Looks like, ‚ÄúJonghyuk you bastard ‚Äú will be my new weekly affirmation mantra "
32,"Jun 18, 2021",Dokja is basically Gilyeongs father at this point
32,"Jan 28, 2021",It was so cool when they both agreed in protecting Gilyeong
32,"Jan 27, 2021","I am glad that they're showing that, however coldly pragmatic Dokja tries and believes himself to be, deep down he is enough of a good person that he wants to protect his group."
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Pleasantly surprised Junghyuk took in Gilyeong. Maybe he does have a heart? Or he just wanted to watch Dokja fight unencumbered ...
32,"Jan 27, 2021","""Gilyeong will not die."" Everyone, this marks the moment that Dokja became a father. *Edit: I just saw the next part where he said ""at least not today"" and I STG THIS BASTARD-"
32,"Jan 31, 2021","honestly, I don't deserve reading this masterpiece for free"
32,"Jan 28, 2021",dokja is gilyeong's father figure ü•∞
32,"Jan 28, 2021","I forgot how much I hate Junghyeok in the earlier chapter, hhhhe get better he get better he get better"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",Dokja is really the BEST PROTAGONIST. I wonder if the author of TWSA is proud of him.

32,"Jan 29, 2021",wait- people hate Dokja? I love his character! huh????
32,"Jan 29, 2021","I mean this comment isn't mine but I thought it would be interesting to mention that this is the first time Dokja has directly answered Jonghyuk's thoughts.  'I told you you would die' ""I'm not gonna die""                     But its really specific enough for Jonghyuk to notice I guess."
32,"Jan 28, 2021","Really tho, Jonghyuk and Dokja‚Äôs relationship is just ‚ÄúBruh your gonna frickin die‚Äù ‚ÄúBruh I‚Äôm not gonna frickin die‚Äù *Dokja lives* ‚ÄúBruh how did you not fricken die?‚Äù ‚ÄúBruh I told you, I‚Äôm not gonna fricken die.‚Äù ‚ÄúBruhhhhh‚Äù And repeat. I love it lol."

32,"Jan 27, 2021",this is only c rank difficulty. i wonder what s or ss difficulty would be
32,"Jan 27, 2021","Honestly even if Dokja ends up separating from the others at some point, I hope Gilyeong will still stay with him. They have such a good relationship and Gilyeong often seems more like an adult that those around him"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",I absolutely love dokja as a character. he is such an ass but he is so human too. 
32,"Jan 27, 2021",gilyeong and dokja's interactions are so fucking wholesome.
32,"Jan 22, 2021",Too be honest you have to give at least some amount of credit when they both want the kid to be safeüòÅit‚Äôs the small victory‚Äôs people

32,"Jan 28, 2021",I have a quick theory so I saw a comment that asked that if to Yu if the people around him were like NPC‚Äôs and that gave me an idea which basically is when Yu regresses the people are always different which means that each time he regresses he goes to a new planet similar to each so each time he dies/regresses he moves to a new place idk how to explain it

32,"Jan 27, 2021","wait y'all it looks like dokja disappeared! you can see that his hand is still there, and the position his hand is in wouldn't make sense if he got eaten"
32,"Jan 27, 2021",I think Junghyeok is testing Dokja to see if he is friend or foe its only times of desperation when we see peoples true colors especially for some one like Dokja who is very secretive. Also I don't blame Junghyeok a mysterious stranger suddenly appears in your third run of the game and wants to be your friend you would think the system is trying to trick and maniupulate you. So yeah

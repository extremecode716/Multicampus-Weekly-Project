Episode,Date,Review
98,"Mar 30, 2022","YESSSS THEY MEET AGAAAAAIN. God I'm so excited. I loved how he was like ""Yeah he'd be sad he didn't get to kill me himself"" like damn does the girl STILL think that him and Junghyeok are together?🤣🤣🤣"
98,"Mar 30, 2022","Lol. Is Dokja feeling bummed out about how all his friends are able to improve their stats and skills when they are away from him, implying somehow that he didn’t improve their growth? Oh Dokja, they might have become stronger without you but it was you who started that journey of theirs."
98,"Mar 30, 2022",OMG! Hyeonseong is back and that too with a bang!! Looks like our original set will be reunited soon. His look of blatant admiration on seeing Dokja is so wholesome. We missed you Hyeonseong just as much as you missed Dokja!
98,"Mar 30, 2022",Captain Korea. Best line
98,"Mar 30, 2022",It's the power of the book. Only when you're not looking can the other characters level up rapidly. Otherwise the Story would have to come up with a Reason for their power increase. 
98,"Mar 30, 2022",Junghyeok: *feeds the guide to the disaster*Dokja: “I see you’ve forgotten to bring your brain to the scenarios this evening”
98,"Mar 30, 2022","Hyeonseong is adorable, I didn't realize how much I missed him."
98,"Mar 30, 2022",omg he turned Army Lieutenant into Captain Korea asdgjkoll I'm dead 💀

98,"Mar 30, 2022",HAHAHA Hyeonseong princess carrying that trespasser 
98,"Mar 30, 2022","Why do I have the feeling that Dokja is gonna yell at Junghyeok ""you fucking donkey"" in the next chapter for what he's doing rn??? "
98,"Mar 30, 2022",Hyeonseong needs a hug
98,"Mar 30, 2022",funny how he is casually running around with a 40k+ bounty on his head. 
98,"Mar 30, 2022","[Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" would like to give 5 coins and a pat on the back of sympathy for Lee Hyunsong.]"
98,"Mar 30, 2022","That part where Dokja came out after Jihye called him...DOKJA'S SO HANDSOME IN THAT PART. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN HANDSOME, BUT IT'S ON A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL IN THAT PART"
98,"Mar 30, 2022",Poor Hyeonseong :(
98,"May 4, 2022","Hyeonseong: The world is an unjust place, with cruelty all around, and I'm tired. the reality is just an illusion, nothing seems-                                         Heyonseong, 2 minutes later- OMG DOKJA"
98,"Mar 30, 2022",Daddy? Sorry. Daddy? Sorry.

98,"Mar 30, 2022",AHH Dokja using Yusung’s skill is so cool! I wondered when he’d replace one of his slots
98,"Mar 30, 2022",I hope the first thing he brings up is the fact they have the same coat just different colors haha
98,"Mar 30, 2022",Hahaha Captain Korea!!!! Dokja the reason they grow stinger is because your not their getting all those boss kills!
98,"Mar 30, 2022",Captain Korea lol 😂 Also did the art get better? 💯

98,"Mar 31, 2022","They meet agsin! Poor Hyeonseong just wanted to catch up with his friend and Dokja just ran by to try and save the day again. Someday Dokja will hang out with his friends, someday."
98,"Mar 30, 2022","poor hyeonseong, he was so happy to see dokja"
98,"Mar 30, 2022",DOKJA'S SO FREAKING HANDSOME OH MY GOD. WHEN HYUNSUNG TURNED AROUND TO LOOK AT HIM...HE'S LITERALLY GLOWING

98,"Mar 30, 2022",back to waiting patiently until next Wednesday  ;_;
98,"May 4, 2022",Prisoner of the Golden Headband is just the comment section at this point 😂😂😂
98,"Apr 3, 2022","I'm so frustrated, I keep reaching the latest episode for these webtoons and I just want MOAR (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻"
98,"Mar 30, 2022",“He’s gone again” poor Hyeonseong 🥲
98,"May 4, 2022",to all novel readers and maybe fast passers: THAT SCENE IS ALMOST HERE!! i cant wait man ive always imagined what it’d look like all drawn and colorized😭👏💖
98,"May 4, 2022",Hyeonseong's personality change when talking to Dokja compared to the other people is pretty funny. He's like a puppy. And I'm so glad Dokja's been reuniting with the people he first met with ! Who knows they might all be together for this catastrophe...
98,"May 4, 2022",Kudos to the lieutenant for having to princess carry that man before yeeting him out!! 🤣🤣
98,"Mar 30, 2022",Lol. I kinda like Queen Mirabel’s treatment of Dokja 😂
98,"May 4, 2022",Ngl I missed Hyeonsong 
98,"May 4, 2022",My man Hyeonsoeng looking at KDJ thru God's filter 😂
98,"May 4, 2022",Prisoner of the Golden Headband is my favorite constellation Xb
98,"Mar 30, 2022",did he just do what we saw just happen? I'm a little scared for what's to come
98,"May 4, 2022","I have a newfound appreciation for Hyeonseong. He may have powered up, but he's still as sweet as ever ^_^"
98,"Apr 6, 2022",Junghyeok and his ego are going to get dokja killed fr one of these chapters

98,"Apr 28, 2022",Everyone’s advancing levels while Dokja is scamming the starstream. 🤣
98,"May 4, 2022",Captain Korea… that’s a good nickname 
98,"May 5, 2022","Lmao, Dokja is literally the embodiment of every tired wife at any social gathering going, ""I have to go find my husband so I can make sure he isn't doing something stupid-"""
98,"May 4, 2022","Han Sooyoung: I just ended a four-year relationship. //Lee Hyunsung: I’m so sorry. Are you okay? //
Han Sooyoung: Oh, I’m fine. It wasn’t my relationship. //
*Jonghyuk and Dokja fighting from across the room*"
98,"May 4, 2022",I would love to know if this webtoon or novel is popular in Korea
98,"Mar 30, 2022","Alright everyone, let's welcome Hyeonseong back to the ""characters who be crushing on dokja/fanfic material"" club! I expect first drafts in by Thursday... "
98,"May 4, 2022","YOO JUST ME OR IS DOKJA AND JUNGHYEOK EXTRA FINE THIS EP, i mean him and dokja are already fine af, but like mmmmm"
98,"May 4, 2022","silly dokja, the queen is like a cat 🐈, she doesn't come when you call she comes when she feels like it"
98,"May 4, 2022",gah damm kim dokja had a bunch of good shots here😩

98,"May 4, 2022","“Constellation, Prisoner of the Golden Headband; is cackling at you” …. Same bro, same 😂😂😂"
98,"May 4, 2022",The subtle change in art from the first episode is soo satisfying.
98,"May 4, 2022",lol I swear Hyeonseong is like the lovable guard dog in that little family Dokja is making. 
98,"May 4, 2022","Precious Himbo Hyeonseong!!!!!!! Captain Korea indeed, I wonder if he’s got koreas 🍑 then 😂😜"
98,"Mar 30, 2022",Hyeonseong is literally so adorable and fluffy 🥺 I can’t 🥺🥺🥺
98,"May 4, 2022",hyeonseong is so adorable i feel so bad for him he was looking forward to seeing dokja 😭
98,"May 5, 2022",I think they actually got stronger because they were motivated to show Dokja they can progress tbh like look at how far Sangah went to feel “useful” in this new world lol 
98,"May 4, 2022",Aw poor Hyeonseong he was so excited to see his homie and he just dipped. Poor guy. I really hope after this the gang is back together I miss them all being together. 
98,"May 4, 2022",Hyeonseong: let me escort you to a safe locationAlso Hyeonseong: *YEETS YOU TO OBLIVION*
98,"May 4, 2022",Heyonseong really just went YEEET
98,"May 4, 2022","If I do remember correctly, I believe that Lee Hyeonseong had a beard or like facial hair at this part."
98,"May 4, 2022",kdj x lhs underrated bromance :’))
98,"May 4, 2022",get you a man who looks at you the way hyunsung looks at dokja 😔 also dokja is so fine tf
98,"May 4, 2022","""He's gone again"" oh dear, sorry 💔"
98,"May 4, 2022",Anyone else think the two mcs look the same but with different hair?
98,"Apr 1, 2022",I hate that I've finally caught up 😭😭😭
98,"May 6, 2022",Damn. Hyeonseong literally just Yeeted a man. Never get on his bad side
98,"May 6, 2022",we won't talk about the fact non main character people can learn to fly.I'm guessing there's a trade-off for that skill sense Dokja hasn't tried to learn it even tho it could make traveling places easier
98,"May 6, 2022",I always read bounty as booty. booty scenario. 
98,"May 5, 2022","""Are you going to kill me too?"" ""I want to but I can't since that might make Master sad."""
98,"May 5, 2022","""Come"" Don't have to tell me twice. LMAO"
98,"May 5, 2022","""And you are..?""
Junghyeok appears from the shade: ""My boyfriend."""
98,"May 5, 2022","Awww, Hyeonseong just missing his boy Dokja"
98,"May 4, 2022","Jihye is precious, I wanna keep her in my pocket. I know she has the skills to kill me but I still want to protect her. She may be older but she's still child #2 (we met her after Gilyeong, I think)"
98,"May 4, 2022","Dokja almost drowning because of his inexperience was satisfactory, I kinda want to see him suffer but not too much"
98,"May 4, 2022","But so much happened to him in ""Bounty Scenario Divine Punishment"" isn't 20 mins. supposed to be already passed? Why does he still have that target mark? 🙄"
98,"May 4, 2022",when captain Korea throws his mighty shield...
98,"May 4, 2022",Yalls were deprived of a Hyeonsung with a beard 
98,"May 4, 2022","Perhaps they don't level up quickly enough when Kim Dokja is around for two reasons: 1- He works his way on the scenarios in an unique way, depending on items or certain skills, so he barely trains them. 2- He is not a Protagonist or MC, so he won't have that Level Up Gang thing (or Friendship power) seen in any other webtoon or anime."
98,"May 4, 2022",I love how dokja is smart in theory but bad in practice 🤣🤣🤣🤣
98,"May 4, 2022",Hyeonseong before Dokja: 👹💥🤬⚠️Hyeonseong after Dokja: 😭💖👶🥺
98,"May 4, 2022","""you have a lot you don't for for someone who has future vision""...😭no boy Junghyeok,you are being naive here "
98,"May 4, 2022",Good job in raising my hopes and dashing them.  Bravo. 
98,"May 4, 2022",The art of the characters was so pretty!!
98,"May 4, 2022",The heaetbreaking part is near😭
98,"May 4, 2022",hyeonsong is just a big baby HSLKJHSYEUOIJIU
98,"Apr 29, 2022",I missed HyeonSeongGlad to see him again
98,"Mar 30, 2022",captain Korea 🤣
98,"Mar 30, 2022","When Dokja was hiding behind the tree, I immediately thought of SAO abridged, that time Rosalia hid behind a tree but her name tag thing above her head revealed her location lmao"
98,"May 6, 2022","the reason they're all stronger is because yjh is basically a spartan , meanwhile kdj was pampering them 🤣"
98,"May 6, 2022",How can Hyeonseong be so menacing and adorable at the same time im crying
98,"May 6, 2022",oh my ! just look at junghyeok's eyeliner 💅💅💅💅
98,"May 6, 2022",i love lee jihye
98,"May 6, 2022","Please don't tell me Junghyeok will throw another ""I know better I'm regressor so shut up Dokja"" BS..."
98,"May 6, 2022",Can we all appreciate how beautiful the art is here?
98,"May 5, 2022",I kin Hyeonseong. I too see Dokja in that light.
98,"May 5, 2022",Dokja is so handsome in THAT one panel. Let me donate to the artist for blessing such art piece.
98,"May 5, 2022",why does it feels like Dokja saw Yjh cheating on him 😭
98,"May 5, 2022","Jihye looking like a snack. Dang she looks different after her departure, more confident. Hyeonseong also looks more buff. He's certainly has become more assertive but he still has a soft spot for Dokja and that's cute. Honestly Dokja, gave them the tools to succeed. The motivation and drive to keep growing. And once everyone became separated from him, they had to grow fast to survive. It's the mama bird approach where they just get thrown out of the nest and either fly or die. "
98,"May 5, 2022",not HyeonSeong YEETING PEOPLE 😂😂😂😂
98,"May 4, 2022",We never really consider how much time 20 minutes are.
98,"May 4, 2022",every panel is just scream worthy
98,"May 4, 2022",clearly they became stronger because you weren't there to hog all the experience points lol but is it wise to show up in front of him now when you're the target of a kill mission?? p.s I mean junghyeok ppl not captain Korea lol I feel like that was obvious that's why I didn't bother stating names in the first place but It seems I was wrong lol
98,"May 4, 2022",Captain Korea 🤣❤️ same butt too?
98,"May 4, 2022",Poor Hyeonseong. He just wants time with his friend. He's like a little puppy.
98,"May 4, 2022",omg there is too much hot ppl for one chapter. (and idk how i will read the rest too.)
98,"May 4, 2022",Wtf is going through that brain to make him give up?  Feeding the scenario guide to the end of the world sounds like giving up to me
98,"May 4, 2022","this chapter was just great, the dragon dragging Dokja underwater was so funny and HYEONSEONG and is Dokja and Miss Poison wearing the same jacket? the outfit of all the main characters romantic prospects, Dokja really making sure he's part of the story (jk jk)"
98,"May 4, 2022",Kinda looks like a butt hole ngl
98,"May 4, 2022","stop it, Hyeonseong just made me simp 50x more AND HEYYY JIHYE IS BACKKK :DGuess were just waiting for Huiwon and the reunion is complete?"
98,"May 4, 2022","Captain Korea, lol"
98,"May 4, 2022",Aww how can Hyeonseong be absolutely terrifying one second and an adorable little child the very next? We all missed him AND Jihye and I'm glad we got to see them both together in one episode again!
98,"May 4, 2022","Dokja looking a little bit hotter this episode 🙈😳 Johye totally looks like Dokja-ssi and Junghyuk's daughter in that one panel AAANDD lmaowhy are the feelings in this episode all mixed up, like, forst there was Dokja getting chased, then him reuniting with two characters we haven't seen for long and then him fucking realizing something changed and unraveling Junghyuk's new plan. I'm sorry, but kind of too fast..."
98,"May 4, 2022",Note: Never anger Captain Korea
98,"May 4, 2022",The water is very prettyActually I never took the time to say it but the art is so beautiful!
98,"May 4, 2022","The old gangs coming back together! Also, feeding what to what?"
98,"May 4, 2022",Hyungsung is great but I can't wait to see more of Jung Heewon
98,"May 4, 2022",this chapter was extra good!!
98,"May 4, 2022","Well, union makes force, but hardships will make one stronger. Though, you need to survive for that. Uniting to get everyone started and build the team, then separating to let everyone grow once they could hold their own, was the right course of action, though it wasn't done on purpose. After all, Dokja was hogging all the coins and achievements when they were together. "
98,"May 4, 2022","Queen Mirabad gives zero Fs, lol"
98,"May 4, 2022","Oh crap, what did you do?"
98,"Mar 30, 2022","""Come,"" he says~~~  (￣y▽￣)╭"
98,"Mar 30, 2022","""keep your distance"" That's lame. But I'm curious about what Jonghyuk is doing with that meteorite? I wonder why he said to the others that the upcoming catastrophe is not dangerous... after all his a regressor hmm"
98,"Mar 30, 2022",god this chapter had me laughing 🤣
98,"May 18, 2022",Captain Korea lmao 
98,"May 9, 2022","If I get to tag along with Dokja, my progress would be slow af too since he'd do all the job smh 🙄"
98,"May 8, 2022",dokja slaps junghyeok’s cheeks 3 times for sure
98,"May 8, 2022","""He turned the army lieutenant into captain korea""😂🤚"
98,"May 7, 2022",hyeonseongs world literally lit up when he saw dokja im crying 😭
98,"May 6, 2022","So happy to see Jihye and Hyeonseong, but damn they're really making me wait for Huiwon reuniting with everyone XD. And Dokja, god love you, but everyone powers up when they aren't with you cuz they actually have to do things themselves, and can't be carried by a future seeing demi-god the whole time lol. (Exaggerating)"
98,"May 6, 2022",“I didn’t realise so many people learned how to fly.” Ummmmm people can FLY? Since when? How? What kind of magic do you need for that? 
98,"May 5, 2022","I'm very ready for the next episode 🤩 For the LN readers, you know what I mean 👀😁"
98,"May 5, 2022",I know there are fellow book readers here to read the webtoon as well. Anyone remember why junhyeok fed the guide to the catastrophe? I only remembered the theory that killing baby beast master would kill catastrophe beast master. 
98,"May 4, 2022",Oh look guys its Dokjas bf 😦
98,"May 4, 2022","""He'd be sad if he didn't get to kill me himself""... Hmmm... That sounds gAY"
98,"May 4, 2022","""Are you going to kill me too?"" PLEASE DO. I'M SO FUCKING DONE WITH THAT BASTARD, YOU OWE ME AN APOLOGY FOR WHAT YOU DID TO EVERYONE DOKJA"
98,"May 4, 2022",🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉HAPPY INTERNATIONAL STAR WARS DAY. MAY THE FOURTH BE WITH YOU
98,"May 4, 2022",JIHYEEEE HYEONSEEOOONNGG HIIII I MISSED YOUUUUU 
98,"May 4, 2022",lhs and kdj both puppy simps... running to their bfs immediately
98,"May 4, 2022",Hope dude got a plan cause if not Dokja can kiss his life goodbye 
98,"May 4, 2022",Hyeonseong totally looks like Daichi from HAIKYUU who just spiked the ball out of anger and scolding the PPL like how he scolds his team for being so loud and not being obedient.
98,"May 4, 2022","the confidence is making me cackle 😭😭 the way Hyeonseong looked when Dokja left him poor boy, indeed 😭😭"
98,"May 4, 2022", WHY'S SHE WITH HIMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM 🕳️🤸
98,"May 4, 2022",The visible happiness in Hyeonseong's face that turned into sadness within seconds 😭 
98,"May 4, 2022","THIS IS MY FIRST COMMENT YA'LL BE WAITING FOR THE NEXT CHAPTER. I MUST SAY THIS SERIES IS VERY LIT, I WON'T BE GOING TO SLEEP FOR A WHILE⚡⚡"

98,"May 4, 2022","Hyeongseong Lee, Kaptain Korea!"
98,"May 4, 2022","Joonghyuk ramblings in the replies because the Disaster of Floods arc gets my brain working overtime (spoilers for his second regression, assumptions about his first regression, and maybe some parts that were mentioned before the part talking about his second regression. oh and vague spoiler about Gilyoung's sponsor. idk i have thoughts and i need to write them down)"
98,"May 4, 2022","oh shit I forgot this is only his 3rd regression if I remember correctly, meaning he doesn't know all the details about the disaster "

98,"Apr 2, 2022","I just remembered that Dokja has that “Undying King” (or “King of Not Killing Other People”) title, so it’s possible that Junghyeuk could actually deliver that “brutal and merciless death” and Dokja would be completely fine (aside from the loss of Karma points or whatever they were called) afterwards."

98,"Jul 23, 2022",dokja thinks that people improve cuz he's not around but idk I think that is just that when they are with him he takes care of everything and protects everyone that they don't have a change to grow.. like an overprotective parent.. lol
98,"Jul 21, 2022","It looks like even Seolhwa Lee (I think that's her, the 'Poison Beauty') owns one of those SSS grade infinity trenchcoats? I like how the attire the main characters choose to wear is both functional and fashionable."

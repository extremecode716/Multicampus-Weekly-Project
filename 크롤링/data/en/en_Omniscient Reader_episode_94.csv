Episode,Date,Review
94,"Mar 2, 2022",Kinda felt sad that Suyeong and Dokja parted ways.
94,"Mar 2, 2022","“Ya, make it look like we’re in a dangerous situation” **LITERALLY MULTIPLE WATER DRAGONS AROUND YOU.**"
94,"Mar 2, 2022",Encourage Incarnation is a power?? Headpats OP
94,"Mar 2, 2022","this man Dokja Kim just casually becoming a father figure for another lost child, what a legend"
94,"Mar 2, 2022","Suyeong leaving them makes sense, but at the same time you can tell that she and Dokja did end up thinking of each other as companions at least a little while they were traveling together. These two need to be a little more honest with each other lol."
94,"Mar 2, 2022",how are the dragons swimming in knee deep waters?
94,"Mar 2, 2022",I didn't realize how much I liked Suyeong until she was gone. 😔
94,"Mar 2, 2022",Yuseung’s little smile after Dokja’s pats her head 😭
94,"Mar 2, 2022",You have become the supporting consolation of Yuseung sin😭❤️…… such a heartwarming panel…Dokja becoming a legend 🥺 and the dad of another child 
94,"Mar 2, 2022",When your girlfriend broke up with you but you didn’t realise it 🤔
94,"Mar 2, 2022",DOKJA SMILING AT YUSEUNG IS SO SWEET
94,"Mar 2, 2022","so basically, dokja is banking on yuseungs ability to communicate with the monsters? this man has way too much confidence lmfao"
94,"Mar 2, 2022",wait is it possible that she never plagiarized anything and is the actual author??
94,"Mar 23, 2022","""prisoner of the golden headband"" and ""secretive plotter"" are true Dokja Kim FANS🥰"
94,"Mar 2, 2022",KDJ said he's not a constellation...yet. Foreshadowing?
94,"Mar 2, 2022","I wonder if Dokja can become a constellation? 🤔 It seemed to imply that he got an incarnation before he became a constellation. Can incarnations become constellations? Like, with Fable’s and stuff?"
94,"Mar 2, 2022","So if her interspecies communication is what makes her a catastrophe, isn't it possible that the other kid might become the catastrophe instead? "
94,"Mar 2, 2022",What’s going on with our other little beast master? Will be a fun to watch Dokjas two kids take out the field with their pet monsters. 
94,"Apr 6, 2022","The authors make Han Sooyoung looks like a bitch at the beginning and make most of the readers hate/dislike her and then show her charms. Just when she started to grow on people, they took her away, now people will miss her and anticipate for her return. This is how most readers fell for her lol"
94,"Mar 13, 2022","DON'T FORGET TO ""LIKE"" ALL THE CHAPTERS! let's get them all to 99999"
94,"Mar 3, 2022",Does anyone else think Secretive plotter might be Future Dokja?
94,"Mar 7, 2022",“Make it look like we’re in a dangerous situation” sorry dokja idk if she can make it look any more dangerous than being surrounded by water dragons 
94,"Mar 2, 2022",Father of the Rich Night & Queen of the Darkest Spring. I await your arrival
94,"Mar 24, 2022",“Even though I’m not a constellation yet” YET! His plan is to become a constellation if nobody has caught on at this point
94,"Mar 2, 2022","Nvm they say he's ugly, he still looks dapper in that coat."
94,"Apr 3, 2022","I miss LAZY BROKE  WEEB, I hope s/he gets his/her paycheck soon "
94,"Mar 31, 2022","I was hoping Suyeong didn't die, and though it had seemed like she had drugged Dokja last chapter, I still didn't expect this. I like how it seems like she's writing a new story now, and it'll follow her journey and be separate from her TWSA/SSSS-Grade dreams. I hope to see her as an ally again. And I'm enjoying seeing Yuseung growing stronger!"
94,"Mar 31, 2022","And so, the adoption papers are complete!🥰"
94,"Mar 2, 2022","he said ""I'm not a constellation YET"" boy if that ain't foreshadowing.... lol"
94,"Mar 2, 2022",OOPS I accidentally dropped my wallet in fastpassimg. I don't need to pretend to be in danger if I got nothing to eat and pass the month.
94,"Apr 6, 2022","HSY writing memos... thats her habit as an author herself. Plagiarizer or not, she really enjoyed writing"
94,"Apr 6, 2022","Isn’t it kinda obvious that suyeong stayed for the same reason he liked her around? It feels nice to be around someone who is in the same situation as you. Thier case being real ppl who know more or less how to get around, she didn’t stick around for any real benifits besides mental comfort "
94,"Apr 6, 2022",SWIM THEY SAY. IT'LL BE FUN THEY SAY.
94,"Apr 6, 2022","what if, now this is crazy, but bare with me. what if the secretive plotter is Dokja of the future? the secretive plotter has more coins than other constellations... just like Dokja seems to have more than everyone else.. and.. they plot like Dokja does xD"
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Bihyeong is really cute sometimes
94,"Apr 6, 2022",I'M SO RELIEVED Suyeong isn't actually dead. I feel a little sad that they've separated tho :( also that last panel looks so badass 
94,"Mar 3, 2022",Daughter: acquired
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Ok but he needs a story to become a constellation right...?.. and if Suyong is writing a book about him or their adventures (or maybe I was reading it wrong idk) he could become a minor constellation using that right? 🤷🏼‍♀️
94,"Mar 3, 2022",I know he mentioned it last chapter too but are we not gonna talk about how the secret plotter be BALLIN with coins like a leprechaun. 
94,"Mar 31, 2022","""This is one of Suyeong's avatars"" that little-! She's my favorite, I was so scared!! "
94,"Mar 3, 2022",I love it every time Dokja gives hugs or headpats to his kids 🥺 Yoosung's reaction after the headpat was so cute 😫
94,"Apr 7, 2022","novel readers who are here to drop spoilers, I'm kindly telling yall to GTFO"
94,"Apr 6, 2022","i feel like the secretive plotter could actually be the author of TWSA because he seems to encourage what Dokja is doing and well,his name is rather suspicious,what do y'all think?🤔🤔🤷‍♂️"
94,"Apr 6, 2022",When your incarnations have incarnations…
94,"Mar 4, 2022",Could Sueyeong be the Writer of the novel or influencing the history of the novel right now? The way it is hinted that she is still writing on the ongoing events makes me think.
94,"Mar 2, 2022",Let’s goooooo!!! Another week of Dokja and his Wittiness
94,"Apr 9, 2022","nooo im gonna miss the Suyeong x  Dokja duo it won't be the same without their bickerings:(( also that note she was writing was a bit sus :00 who is she really,, "
94,"Apr 6, 2022",[The constellation of poorness looks pitifully at their small pile of coins]
94,"Apr 6, 2022","Today I found out that my dog is being put down, and remembering that this WEBTOON updated was one of the only things to put a smile on my face. I know the creators will probably never read this, but from the bottom of my heart, thank you."
94,"Apr 6, 2022","Theory time.... what if this whole time, Secretive Plotter was him all along? from the future, in some sense, seeing as constellations are timeless and all that"
94,"Apr 6, 2022",yuseung looks like dokja and sangah's child
94,"Apr 6, 2022",I replied to every single comment on Chapter 98. Being a donut seller sure is tiring lmao
94,"Apr 6, 2022",It is interesting that no one spoke on the fact that Suyeong is journalling the whole story of himself and Dokja😧He's going to make the bestselling book after it's all done😱🤯😂😂
94,"Mar 30, 2022",Can’t Gilyeong also control animals… I’m a bit concerned that Dokja nurturing this kid is leaving a hole for our first baby to become the catastrophe 
94,"Mar 2, 2022","suyeong and dokja are both tsundere 😂 yall will never admit that yall already grew fond of each other as companions. also, dokja's leadership though. i knew how this manhwa ended, but lord i'll keep going 😌 im already too deep for this shit."
94,"Apr 7, 2022",Adoption: complete
94,"Apr 6, 2022","Dokja is getting a bit bold with those ""yet""s after saying he's not a constellation"
94,"Apr 6, 2022",parenting 101 🤯😅
94,"Apr 6, 2022",I feel like this si the equivalent oOf throwing your kid in the pool when theh don’t know how to swim. There’s a risk
94,"Apr 9, 2022","Update: WEBTOON translated Kim Dokja's Ruler title as 'Immortal King' in Episode 98. But if you check Episode 53, it's translated as 'King of no Killing'."
94,"Apr 9, 2022",Love the part about how he's not a constellation... YET
94,"Apr 6, 2022","Hear me out: Suyeong is becoming the new author of the story. She had to step back to write from that perspective. Each time this happens, a new author writes the story. That’s why the regenerations are always different. They are written by different authors with different people. Suyeong will be the new author and her story will be read by someone in and world and will be used as a guide. "
94,"Apr 6, 2022","so,the Plagiarizer is writing her own novel now... turning into a real author in the apocalypse..."
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Notice how he says he isn't a constellation 'yet'. Real suspicious 
94,"Apr 6, 2022",How the heck are they walking in waist deep water but thoses monsters are able to dive and swim around when they are that big 😂
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Suyeong is not a plagiarizer - Dokja has read the entire story. She is not plagiarizing because she is writing about what she is going through and foreshadowing events through her writing
94,"Mar 31, 2022",Fast passing because I refuse to believe she's dead
94,"Mar 30, 2022",He literally is throwing her in the deep end to see if she can swim🤣
94,"Mar 3, 2022",I can’t get over how adorable Yuseung is
94,"Mar 2, 2022",wouldn't it be weird if he was the secretive plotter? 
94,"Mar 30, 2022",OKAY BUT IS NO ONE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SUYEONG TYPING MORE TO A STORY?? IS *SHE* ACTUALLY THE AUTHOR?
94,"Apr 11, 2022",I just went through every comment and there’s no lazy broke weeb!!!!
94,"Apr 8, 2022","Suyeong and Dokja like each other dude, they’re friends but like those friends who don’t even know that they’re friends bdbfsshjgvdfb"
94,"Apr 8, 2022","what's Suyeong typing on her phone??? is it the plot that converts to the plot of TWSA (in the past, parallel universe kind of thingy?)... pretty sure it's part of her power?! otherwise she's just writing it for after they managed to survive, which is pointless? lul"
94,"Apr 8, 2022",[The Scavenger of Worms takes interest in the given scenario.] [5 coins have been gifted.]
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Anybody else wondering how that water is only knee deep for dokja yet those massive monster are swimming around? 
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Interesting how he says he's not a constellation YET lol
94,"Apr 6, 2022",aaah 2/3 children have been webtoon-ed <3<3 the only one left is his biological child. with Bihyung. the dokkaebi.
94,"Apr 6, 2022",I wonder... could dokja be [secretive plotter] watching his own tale be written?
94,"Apr 6, 2022","ahh yes, traumatized your incarnation to make their power blossoms"
94,"Apr 6, 2022",dokja: pretend your in danger. dokja: surrounded by a bunch of blood thirsty gyarados'.
94,"Mar 31, 2022","🎶""You are my daaad, Youre my dad! boogie woogie woogie""🎶 -Yuseung to Dokja, probably"
94,"Apr 6, 2022",[The constellation Mass Production Maker is enjoying the story and hopes there will be a kick starter to make this an anime!!! Mass production maker also waves hello to the other constellation and encourages them to support the author.] [Mass Production Maker sponsors 5 coins]
94,"Jun 6, 2022",dokja lowkey becoming a sugar daddy. he got no powers but he has the money 😏 
94,"Apr 12, 2022","I WASNT CAUGHT UP AND YO I AM NOW AND IM KINDA UPSET. i’m angry that i got so far behind but i have been on all of the7,000 webtoons i read. but like i can’t keep reading😭"
94,"Apr 12, 2022",hi all! suyeong and Dokja shipper here😘
94,"Apr 10, 2022",by the way what happened with Yoo Joonghyuk's little sister?
94,"Apr 10, 2022","So, Suyeong went away just to see Dokja's reaction 👀"
94,"Apr 9, 2022","nooo im gonna miss suyeong and dokjas banters :,("
94,"Apr 9, 2022",KDJ TRAUMATISING CHILDREN LEFT AND RIGHT
94,"Apr 8, 2022",Suyeong it won't be same without your snickers
94,"Apr 8, 2022",at least suyeong isn’t dead (: i hope we see her soon
94,"Apr 8, 2022",im so relieved suyeong isnt dead 😭
94,"Apr 7, 2022","Listen, I love Dokja, but he's starting to act like an asshole. Is it that hard to send a message to Suyeong? And I feel like he's making Yuseong sign the contract with him just to have control over her when her future self comes. Yuseong has already benefited from Dokja's (monetary) help without a contract, so if she were smarter and less kind then she would be able to take advantage of him easily. I guess Dokja's only bringing up the contract now because he knew she was too kind-hearted to...."
94,"Apr 7, 2022","until now I still cannot get over how gorgeous the art is, especially the last panel 😍❤"
94,"Apr 7, 2022",Maybe Suyeong is the real writer of TWSA. It looked like she was continuing to write a novel or something.
94,"Apr 7, 2022",Still thinking Dokja and Suyeong are soulmates
94,"Apr 7, 2022",Having read the novel I’m 70% here for the art and 30% here for the comments and speculations HEHEHE it’s so fun
94,"Apr 6, 2022","This may be a weird theory but I think suyeong might be the writer of twsa, she wasn't lying when she said her story wasn't plagiarized but her story is way too similar to twsa even if they have similar concepts, this chapter definitely helped that theory cause I think she's still writing her story in the panel on her phone"
94,"Apr 6, 2022",the last panel was stunning
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Was Suyeong writting a novel using the current events?
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Did everyone think the same thing on that.. One panel..
94,"Apr 6, 2022",I cant wait bc dokja said “because im not a constellation yet…”
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Beautiful strip on the last part
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Honestly don't come to the comments while reading this the plot twists and reveals are absolutely amazing and if you can't wait go read the light novel it's as amazing as this 
94,"Apr 6, 2022",I don’t understand the upvotes for the top comment.  I mean Dokja literally said he’s gonna get more incarnations to support 
94,"Apr 6, 2022",yoosung's smile after dokja pats her head... i adore them. found family <33333
94,"Apr 6, 2022","Did you noticed she was writting on her phone? When she said she didnt copy the manga, what if all this already happened and the reason why her manga is so alike is because this has happen before but her story is about dojka "
94,"Apr 6, 2022",I’m just wondering where lazy broke weeb is at
94,"Apr 6, 2022",uhm am i misattributing the text or is suyeong actively writing down things before they happen... is she like the author of this new world??? does she have some kind of foresight as one of her powers that makes her able to write down the future as a narrative?
94,"Apr 6, 2022",This Manhwa is REALLY living up to my expectations of adapting the light novel into a graphic novel. This is just beautiful. (For some reason when I read the light novel I imagined Yuesung to look like Eve from “The Advanced Player of the Tutorial Tower”).
94,"Apr 6, 2022",secretive plotter is more intriguing each episode
94,"Apr 6, 2022",one minute i’m “laughs in knowing who sp really is” and the next i’m “cries cuz we near the sad arcs”
94,"Apr 6, 2022","The identity of the secretive plotter might be Morgiana or Sinbad, I know I might be wrong again like the last time I thought Perseus is the constellation of Sangah but this is just a guess from the informations available us."
94,"Apr 6, 2022","Or, you know, Suyeong didn't think of that plan before... Sometimes the easier answer is the correct one. But yeah, she probably has a reason to do all that. Also, she's still writing? Really must be a passion."
94,"Apr 6, 2022","I just want to say, Yuseng is adorable and I want to give her a hug. Maybe I'll add her to the list of anime kids who everyone in the series should be ready to die to protect."
94,"Apr 6, 2022","Didn't think I'd feel sad for the Plagiarist. She's writing her own life's experiences as a story. Why did she leave all of a sudden if she could have always done this? Has she actually developed feelings for him and the leaving has something to do with that?
Or does it have something to do with the conversation about the novel's story and their reality? Perhaps she wants to find out the truth?"
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Head pats from Kim Dokja are enough motivation for me.
94,"Apr 6, 2022",He keeps saying he’s not a constellation “yet” so does that mean if he gains a certain amount of power or money he can become one? 
94,"Apr 6, 2022",suyeongs writing a story about them in the story while they are the webtoons story
94,"Apr 6, 2022",There’s nothing like falsehoods to get the comic going.  
94,"Apr 6, 2022",is avatar like a clone? 
94,"Apr 6, 2022","Dokja may be eager to reap the benefits of supporting an incarnation, but that doesn't mean the smile on his face after Yuseung accepted the contract wasn't genuine. Seriously, it looked so sweet. Also, I'm glad Suyeong's still alive. She's an interesting character."
94,"Mar 2, 2022",that's how you do flooding for PTSD.. lol..
94,"Mar 2, 2022","Goodbye Suyeong, you will be missed until you pop up again."
94,"Mar 2, 2022","Suyeong…, I’m honestly gonna miss her sarcastic self 🥲"
94,"Apr 8, 2022","Okaaaaay so I think Suyeong is either 1. The original writer of TWSA 2. The supported incarnation of the constellation who wrote TWSA OR 3. She has a special attribute that allows her to write the future, due to her reading the original story and plagiarizing it. 
Anyone else got theories?! In any case, I think she's a lot more important to this story than I had previously thought."
94,"Mar 30, 2022","Why would he look for you when you left a note saying ""for your troubles""?"
94,"Sep 19, 2022","The moment they split apart, I desperately wanted to cry."
94,"Aug 11, 2022",It was confirmed that  Suyeong didn't plagiarize Twsa...and then we see her writing down things on her phone. Could she be the actual author? 
94,"Jun 14, 2022","Suyeong and Dojka could make a very good friendship, relationship. I'm sad, please, meet again T^T"
94,"Apr 24, 2022",Isn't it funny that Biyeong looks so cute when he used to look so creepy in the beginning?
94,"Apr 12, 2022",OVER 2000! Happy National Grilled Cheese Sandwich Day!! 🥪🥪🧀🧀🎉🎉
94,"Apr 12, 2022","Suyeong is creating her own story during all of this. it's an interesting thing to see for sure, I wonder where that plotline goes."
94,"Apr 12, 2022",i can wait a day for the next episode to be free totally 
94,"Apr 11, 2022",bro what if sueyong is the writer of twsa
94,"Apr 11, 2022",I finally caught up with this series! dokkaebi are so much cuter than in the beginning. thanks artist and author. 
94,"Apr 11, 2022",this is such a farfetched theory but what if suyeong is the writer of twsa
94,"Apr 10, 2022",ummm??? suyeong was writing?? IS SUYEONG ACTUALLY THE REAL AUTHOR OR TWSA? IS SHE STILL WRITING THE NOVEL?
94,"Apr 8, 2022","Hol up, we saw suyeong writing down a story on her phond.... what if she TURNS BACK IN TIME AND BECOMES THE AUTHOR"
94,"Apr 7, 2022",notice how Dokja said he isn't a supporting constellation YET??
94,"Apr 7, 2022",The Chinese Celestial Narwhal of Forgotten Times has taken an interest to you.
94,"Apr 7, 2022",Did he or did he say he isn’t a constellation yet. I feel like this needs attention
94,"Apr 7, 2022",cool
94,"Apr 7, 2022","What a wholesome moment between a child and the guy who's about to drag her into dragon infested waters. Dang, I love this series!"
94,"Apr 7, 2022",longest 10 days ever 
94,"Apr 7, 2022",how can can a 50m water dragon swim right beside where dokja is walking?
94,"Apr 7, 2022","Hold on, is Suyeong the author? Cause she’s literally like writing and it’s possible she just wrote 2 books? Like maybe?"
94,"Apr 7, 2022",I wonder if beast girl and bug boy will get along
94,"Apr 7, 2022",anyone else ship dokja and suyeong?
94,"Apr 7, 2022","As someone who read the novel, novel readers should butt out of the comments of webtoon-only readers theorizing stuff cuz... why would you spoil the story for them?? "
94,"Apr 7, 2022",Okay at least she isnt dead- But sad they parted ways
94,"Apr 7, 2022",dilf dokja arc ??
94,"Apr 6, 2022",what happened to the lazy week constellation 
94,"Apr 6, 2022",...SpGirl18's comment got deleted..they might have deleted it..but who knows
94,"Apr 6, 2022",uuuuuuuuuuuuuuup😽😽
94,"Apr 6, 2022",can't Dokja just bookmark her interspecies ability and use it himself 
94,"Apr 6, 2022","aaaa that was so cute, a prelude to what's going to happen later. This wholesomeness is a nice snack"
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Bruh she stealing content again 
94,"Apr 6, 2022",the art is amazing i love this
94,"Apr 6, 2022",that last panel is so good wow
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Suyeong left... at least she isnt dead - but still sad to see my fav gone :(
94,"Apr 6, 2022","I knew Suyeong wasn't dead, but god damnit I don't want her to leave the group either, wth man. You better not meet again as enemies woman, damn you for leaving us. I get why she did it, doesn't make it any better :("
94,"Apr 6, 2022","Wait a minute, ""I'm not a constellatipn yet"" what does that even means?! "
94,"Apr 6, 2022","Phew 😮‍💨, glad she’s not dead 💀 "
94,"Apr 6, 2022",suyeong can trick dokja well lol
94,"Apr 6, 2022",i didn't get it why suyeong left 
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Suyeong was fun ;(
94,"Apr 6, 2022","If only dokja can sponsor us as well, then our support will be doubled when he finally have his own supporting constellation. And finally we can fast pass nonstop"
94,"Apr 6, 2022",cant wait for this series to finish all 551 chapters AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
94,"Apr 6, 2022","So glad Suyeong is still alive, I hope their paths cross again, as she's my favorite character"
94,"Apr 6, 2022",The art is so perfect 👏👏
94,"Apr 6, 2022",is she is the writer? who made this world
94,"Apr 6, 2022",*you died*
94,"Apr 6, 2022","He's not a constellation... yet.can't wait, love this series "
94,"Apr 6, 2022",suyeong 😞
94,"Apr 6, 2022","I love how dokja is such a manipulative protagonist, but he manipulates his allies for their own betterment. so far, he's manipulated LHS into having faith that what he's doing is just (or at least, the best he can do in the apocalypse (and it's true, LHS is helping as many people as he can, and that's good)), and he's now manipulating SYS into reaching her full potential. there's the time he manipulated YJH by pretending to kidnap YMA, but she wasn't in any real danger, so I'll let it slide lol"
94,"Apr 6, 2022","I get the lingering feeling that the secretive plotter could be the author. It would explain why they have so many coins but dokja knows nothing about them. Also the name makes sense a little, since authors are always plotting turns in the story right out of the reader’s view."
94,"Apr 6, 2022","I'm kinda worries that, if Dokja does his job with Yuseung too well, the scenario might try to replace her with Gilyeong as the catastrophe."
94,"Apr 6, 2022",So he officially has his own kid now. Sweet.
94,"Apr 6, 2022",lol. Bihyeong? you deserve it
94,"Apr 6, 2022",wait she is writing a book on him now or am I just confused
94,"Apr 6, 2022","excuse me for having a bad memory but when and why did sangah, the kid, the other person seperate in the first place? :P"
94,"Apr 6, 2022","Wow, Suyeong has been writing the whole time? Feels nice actually "
94,"Apr 6, 2022",And the plot thickens. Can't wait to see if this gamble pays off!
94,"Apr 6, 2022",You are special. You are loved.
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Well . . .We now have 3 overpowered characters
94,"Apr 6, 2022","Wow so Sooyoung didn't die after all, but i am sad that we won't be able to read their small banters, it was fun while it lasted"
94,"Apr 5, 2022",I wish I had a constellation so I could read more episodes :(
94,"Mar 30, 2022","I feel kinda sad , uhh mm void somehow..I definitely liked her character...and i like how she basically is confident that she can survive by herself and decided to go her own way.. she is smart , cunning and practical and she probably can grow better acting individually lol"
94,"Mar 30, 2022",I skipped ahead and now I want to skip ahead again omfg it sooooo good 
94,"Mar 3, 2022",Correct me if I'm wrong but was Suyeong writing narrative to the current story as it happens? Like she was updating the script as changes occur?  
94,"Mar 2, 2022","bruh, she really said, "" fk dis shit I'm out."""
94,"Mar 2, 2022",Finally another chapter! 😍
94,"Jul 29, 2022",No one gonna talk about the fact that Suyeong is writing what’s happing in her life in the format of a “Webnovel”
94,"Jul 7, 2022",Gonna miss Dokja and Suyeong's bickering
94,"Jun 29, 2022",nah it was way too cute when she looked up at where dokja gave head pats with her hand
94,"Jun 10, 2022","Suyeong sure is an author, she even continue her series despite being in the middle of appocalypse"
94,"Jun 9, 2022","The head pat was so cute. Great chapter, was a bit sad to see Suyeong leave. "
94,"Jun 8, 2022",CAN👏WE👏TAKE👏A FEW MOMENTS 👏TO APPRECIATE THE AWESOMENESS OF THE AUTHORS ART?????? ✨ THE BEAUTY ✨ of the last panel sent me dimensions away! 😭💖😤
94,"May 29, 2022","Dokja babe you're not fooling anyone, we know that the ""support contract"" is just a disguise for adoption papers and we'll love you just as much even if you don't say support contract lmao."
94,"May 27, 2022",Anyone going to talk about how Suyeong was writing about their adventures the whole time? 
94,"Apr 30, 2022",Be prepared guys there’s no telling if he might get eaten (again)
94,"Apr 23, 2022","Brah, thought she was dead "
94,"Apr 19, 2022",At least she isnt dead…almost gave me a heart attack-
94,"Apr 14, 2022","Is prisoner of the golden headband sun wukong? (Pls no spoilers, I’m just theorizing)"
94,"Apr 13, 2022",I didn't like Suyeong but now I feel empty that she's gone. What have you done author why am I so sad
94,"Apr 13, 2022",haha I'd have no problem acting like we are in a dangerous situation cause id freak with being around those water dragons 
94,"Apr 12, 2022",HWA HWA G WA WHAVWGAVWA EPISODE 98 IS NOW FREE ON NAVER WEBTOON
94,"Apr 12, 2022",he is not a constellation YET 👀
94,"Apr 12, 2022",What am I going to comment on Episode 99 💀
94,"Apr 12, 2022",Have I dreamt? I thought that he actually got an unknown stigma a few chapters ago.
94,"Apr 11, 2022",Day 93 of voicing all the characters
94,"Apr 11, 2022",I need Dokja as my sugar daddy
94,"Apr 10, 2022",I SAW SOMEONE FROM EPISODE 98 NAMED KDJ SHOE LICKER LMAO
94,"Apr 10, 2022",... Tsundere
94,"Apr 10, 2022",nooooo!!! why do I read so ... fast
94,"Apr 9, 2022",That last panel tho 
94,"Apr 8, 2022",Can someone tell me where this leaves off in the web novel?
94,"Apr 8, 2022",*Most people*: Not a supporting constellation YET? *Me*: oh trust me it gets wierder
94,"Apr 8, 2022",haven't become a constellation YET
94,"Apr 7, 2022","Hold on....man said ""even though I'm not a constellation YET."" Uhm...is the author dropping hints right now?! At this point, I won't even be surprised if Secret Plotter ends up being him (though thats a far-fetched idea)."
94,"Apr 7, 2022",The way Dokja was pulling Yuseong with the rope made me think of those little harnesses parents put on their kids to keep them from wandering off. Dokja’s such a good mom
94,"Apr 7, 2022","My dude Dokja, you gotta stop saying such profound things as if they were simple facts. The other characters can't keep up with the amount of whiplash and the amount of head-turning that they have to do."
94,"Apr 7, 2022",from hating suyeong to feeling sad over her leaving dokja😭😭😭😭
94,"Apr 7, 2022",oh yeah he gettin his sword ready 🗡️
94,"Apr 7, 2022",That final panel goes hard
94,"Apr 7, 2022","Who else had their heart kinda sink when he said Suyeong was a corpse, I genuinely like her character "
94,"Apr 7, 2022",Whew!!!! I thought Suhyeong was dead😅😅😅
94,"Apr 7, 2022",The powers of head pats
94,"Apr 6, 2022",kinda sad that suyeong left the group but at least she's not dead
94,"Apr 6, 2022",I wonder what happens when Yuseung and that insect boy meet up 🤔
94,"Apr 6, 2022","phew, atleast shes not deAD"
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Wow. 7 comments left.
94,"Apr 6, 2022",naurr Suyeong my girll 😭😭
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Thats scary
94,"Apr 6, 2022",I find out yuseung have two person from past and future you know. 😎
94,"Apr 6, 2022","I have the suspicion that secretive plotter is actually Dokja, either from the future or from a previous loop"
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Yeah. I knew she couldn't possibly be dead. / Looks like the plan to get Catastrophe Jr. to level up is progressing smoothly as well.
94,"Apr 6, 2022",I love this. It's so cool. Kim Dokja will be going to be a dad figure and I just can't wait for next Wednesday. Thanks author for making our day with this awesome story. Friction becoming reality is dream of every reader and weeb. 
94,"Apr 6, 2022","ah yes, Kim dokja and his kids"
94,"Apr 6, 2022",I have reread this from the beginning for two days and never thought that this is the latest chapter 😭
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Sea snek: hai :>
94,"Apr 6, 2022",ahhh Suyeong and Dokja. i dont wnat them to be separate 
94,"Apr 6, 2022",b-b-but black hair lady! I didn't hate her 😢
94,"Apr 6, 2022","dokja: we'll swim across ,, Shangah: 👁️👄👁️"
94,"Apr 6, 2022",glad that suyeong is alive but sad she left 🥺🥺
94,"Apr 6, 2022",What a way to test her power 😳
94,"Apr 6, 2022",How make it look like its dangerous even tho its already dangerous
94,"Apr 6, 2022",This will go well... 😅
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Mannnn.... why he let best girl Suyeong go so easily. 😢
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Dokja's really killing two stones at once with Yuseung... helping her for her and getting more potential constellations for him... And I wonder if Suyeong's been writing the whole time...
94,"Apr 6, 2022","Every single time I see that river full of giant aquatic snakes I'm like ""Nah ah Bro, that's my limit"" 🙅 ""no way, I'm ever going to cross that death trap"" ❌❌❌ That would be my worst nightmare 😂 meanwhile he walks with confidence. Not even the fourth wall skill would nullify that on me 😓 "
94,"Apr 6, 2022",so cute😖
94,"Apr 6, 2022",yuseung is so cute i cant wait to see how this goes
94,"Apr 6, 2022",'Encourage Incarnation' reminds me so much of 'My Brat is the best' from that other series 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
94,"Apr 6, 2022","Something that occurred to me between chapters that probably should have occurred to me a long time ago: We don't know when Suyeong started writing Infinite Regressor in relation to when she read TWSA. But TWSA ran for decades after she would have stopped reading at chapter 100. Unless Sueyong only started writing IR fairly recently, her ""Plagiarism"" would have presumably reached events of TWSA passed the point she had read, and if we are really to believe her claim that it's not plagiarized,"
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Dokja’s gonna be adopting more children real soon huh
94,"Apr 6, 2022",So she just left?? What a loss. 
94,"Apr 6, 2022","Oh my God, wow! Okay. Theory time. Suyeong was reading something on her phone. A book, possibly... her plagiarized book? One that mentions Dokja? Does that mean that her book is the reason Dokja exists? Is it possible that Dokja is just a character in her book? Wow, I can't believe I don't see anyone else discussing this. It's really interesting!"
94,"Apr 6, 2022",I keep wondering if the secretive plotter is Dokja in the future or something but not sure if this will play with time like that. 
94,"Apr 6, 2022","love how he said ""im not a constellation YET"" YET....hes gunna go for it. "
94,"Apr 6, 2022",I don't even know why I'm crying tf
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Secretive Plotter has to be Dokja.
94,"Apr 6, 2022",i thought han sueyong died i was going to fuxking get pissed and not count it as lore
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Part of me is wondering if Secretive Plotter is our boy Dokja but in the future somehow. That would be wild
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Theory!! Dokja said that he wasn’t a constellation yet which means there’s a possibility he could become a constellation. I think that if they beat the game they’re able to become constellations. Maybe not though idk
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Tjis chapter was free in 2 hours but i accidently spent my coins on it. 😭✋🏽
94,"Apr 4, 2022",He's such a dad 😭 also he looks so disappointed that Han Sooyung left him and broke the contract ow :<
94,"Apr 2, 2022",why am I so poor!! I want to keep reading!!! I need a constellation to support me 😢
94,"Mar 31, 2022","I know it's a stretch, but I kinda get the feeling Secretive Plotter is him from the future or the author of the novel."
94,"Mar 31, 2022","""Even though I'm not a constellation yet"" yet?! Damn"
94,"Mar 31, 2022","Ughh, i just want to see the gang reunite alreadyy😭😭 Dont get me wrong, i love the story's development but i miss the group together. Like, what are they up to?? Also, Dokja again with his other child💜"
94,"Mar 31, 2022",Dokja is like Batman. -Whats your superpower??  -...Im rich😎
94,"Mar 31, 2022",oh so it’s just her avatar... and is it just me or this ep seemed short (?)
94,"Mar 30, 2022",I wonder how many subscribers he has XDD
94,"Mar 24, 2022",i feel like if dokja ever ends up picking a supporting constellation it would be secretive plotter 
94,"Mar 18, 2022",waaahhh!!! 😭😭😭😭 I'm just glad she is alive 😭😭
94,"Mar 16, 2022",I’m starting to think that Secretive Plotter is Dokja in the future as a constellation :? 
94,"Mar 12, 2022",You call that swimmin'?
94,"Mar 7, 2022","Oh, thank god. She’s not really dead. "
94,"Mar 3, 2022",I wonder if bug boy will become a disaster when he found the parasite in the wolf's body that felt so sinister
94,"Mar 3, 2022",This chapter was very satisfying 
94,"Mar 2, 2022",hooo... somethings is interresting. Secret Ploter. you know way to much ma boy. stop foreshadowing the fact that there will be more incarnation
94,"Mar 2, 2022",I wonder if Dokja will become a constellation in the future 
94,"Mar 2, 2022",:)))
94,"Mar 2, 2022",I like how the author keeps foreshadowing with the amount of days left.
94,"Mar 2, 2022","when kindness doesn't work, we advance into fear apparently. but is it just me that panicked about a dead body? I'm not ready for that death "
94,"Mar 2, 2022",That's not swimming. Pretty sure they're walking in 3 feet deep water with leviathans apparently afraid to drown in the deep.
94,"Mar 2, 2022",Suyeong just said ✌️
94,"Mar 2, 2022",Is anyone else really glad that the fake author isn't dead? i was so sad last week because of how much i loved their chemistry with each other. Hopefully they reunite soon.
94,"Mar 2, 2022",That little demon baby goat looks so precious when he’s happy😈🥺
94,"Mar 2, 2022",She looked so cute after the head pat 🥺
94,"Apr 6, 2022",Yussung is literally the cutest character I've seen how could she be a catastrophe
94,"Apr 6, 2022","“Make it seem like we’re in a dangerous situation.” IF THIS ISN’T ALREADY A DANGEROUS SITUATION, I DON’T KNOW WHAT IS MY GUY."
94,"Mar 2, 2022","Suyeong probably can’t handle any more of dokja in a romantic way 😌 that’s love, men usually can’t figure it out like dokja doesn’t know why she left"
94,"Mar 2, 2022",AHHH DOKJA'S SMILE. SO WHOLESOME
94,"Sep 19, 2022",That last panel is so cool
94,"Sep 19, 2022",I just found this toon last week and have been binging reading this made me feel like dokja when he read twsa it really immerses u
94,"Sep 16, 2022",Okay she’s fine TY Authors !! 👏😁👌

94,"May 26, 2022",i wonder what the deleted comment with 229 replies was
94,"May 24, 2022",I honestly was kind of hoping they would fall in love with each other since they both love to read and seem more common.
94,"May 7, 2022","Welp there goes my favorite ship. Eh im not gonna worry about that. You will meet again, I'll make it that you do gehehehe"

94,"Apr 28, 2022",It makes me so sad to see the amount of likes going down the further through this webtoon I read... this is the best webtoon I've read so I'm going to keep reading till the end
94,"Apr 23, 2022","Why was Suyeong upset he didn’t look for her when she clearly left? By that I mean, there were no signs of foul play or that she went missing, she wanted to go and made sure they couldn’t stop her, what could he have done?"
94,"Apr 22, 2022","Well… at least Suyeong is finally writing an original story  🤷🏽‍♀️. We’ll see her again, hopefully they can reconcile"
94,"Apr 20, 2022",he said “im not eve a constellation YET” idk man but foreshadowing orr???
94,"Apr 20, 2022",„He could at least pretend to look for me“ Suyeong I hope you find your way back to us soon! 
94,"Apr 19, 2022",dokja I get you're heartbroken because both your gf (suyeong) and bf (jungheok) have left you but now is not the time bestie you'll meet them again so just focus on surviving 
94,"Apr 17, 2022",And just like that my favorite duo in this series was destroyed due to SOME BS (jk jk but sad to see Suyeong and Dokja separate)

94,"Apr 14, 2022","Awww I think she’s felt that they were friends but now she’s kinda doubting them or wanting him to prove it, its so sad"
94,"Apr 14, 2022",Am just gonna say this once but why does every panel of this webtoon looked like its perfect to be my wallpaper hahaha 
94,"Apr 14, 2022",DOES THAT MEAN SUYEONG IS THE AUTHOR??!!

94,"Mar 31, 2022",I used coins and am happy she’s not dead but what’s she up to 
94,"Mar 24, 2022",Yuseung being in that box-ship is wayy too cute and funny ahah
94,"Mar 18, 2022","if i were dokja, and filthy rich, id make the girls my own incarnation lol... author received 5 coins from me again lol"
94,"Mar 17, 2022","Ohhh damn, the awakening episode is already up? This is the beginning of this little girls story :D"
94,"Mar 8, 2022","I feel like Secretive Plotter is actually the author, might be a stretch but that seems plausible right now."
94,"Mar 7, 2022","Is Dokja already one of the constellations? With his ability to copy stigmas, he can make avatars like the plagiarist. Then his real body can ascend and he can be a pseudo regressor. "
94,"Mar 4, 2022",Imagine Secretive Plotter is Dokja in the future heheheh
94,"Mar 3, 2022","Daughter: acquired, mysterious author: lost. Party change-up! Dokja really is bad at understanding people.
Also, maybe Secretive Plotter is an alternate of one of the incarnations we know if they gifted Dokja coins for signing his FIRST support contract?"
94,"Mar 3, 2022",just a thought but what if secret plotter is really some future form of Dokja or something similar
94,"Mar 3, 2022","It took a week but holy hell, I burned through these chapters. Now on that paywall weekly grind…"
94,"Mar 2, 2022",I would pretty much open my mouth THAT big for Dokja. Thank you
94,2 days ago,"ahh... so... Suyeong likes Dokja? I mean, i was kinda doubtful about it but maybe she does"
94,2 days ago,man... it's really sad to see Dokja like that. He definitely feels betrayed & sad that Suyeong left like that... At first i was scared & worried that she died all of a sudden then pissed at her for leaving like that but...
94,2 days ago,they should get gilyoung to train yuseong
94,2 days ago,Couldn't Dokja lend her the stigma self Judjement. This would solve the problem. 
94,2 days ago,"""The constellation of binge reading"" has been reading it while expressing many emotions."
94,2 days ago,"They are swimming with Gyarados around them, that is brave."

94,"Oct 1, 2022",I almost cried when they showed her puppy I thought she killed it to pass the first scenario 
94,"Oct 1, 2022",i kind of hope we see dokja becomes a constellation like can you imagine the other constellations reaction to him appearing in the sky? 😂
94,"Sep 30, 2022","what a relief, i thought she really died"

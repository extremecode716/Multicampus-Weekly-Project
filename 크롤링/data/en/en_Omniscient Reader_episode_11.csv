So many moments full of twists and turns in all directions that will make your jaw drop, it’s crazy... Not to mention the massive amounts of crazy foreshadowing the author places in each and every chapter, this one included! Webtoon readers have no idea how legendary this story truly is and by the time you do, it will give the best ending you can possibly imagine!!!"

11,"Oct 7, 2020","""The constellation secret plotter is impressed by your foolishness"" OH my gwad🤣🤣🤣"
11,"Sep 2, 2020",All I know is that the protagonist has to be even more dangerous. Since he killed everyone in his car. Then the fact that Dokja had them run away from him. So I'm thinking the protagonist might not be a good guy. 
11,"Apr 26, 2021",Secretive plotter literally went “oh my god he’s so stupid I love him” and gave him coins why is this so funny
11,"Oct 7, 2020",Come on Kim Dokja get your man ahahat 😉

11,"Sep 30, 2020",I spent all of my coins just to be on a cliffhanger
11,"Sep 2, 2020",Is it just me or do the MC (Dokja) and the protagonist look a lot alike?
11,"Sep 5, 2021","""secretive plotter is impressed by your foolishness"" lmaooo"
11,"Apr 27, 2021","""Secretive plotter is impressed by ur foolishness""... . Really now 🤣🤣"
11,"Apr 26, 2021","Okay so, for a moment I was like ""What if someone who made it across came back?"" but that wouldn't work because it's still an odd number, despite if they made th check point. Also I was kinda WOAH bc I thought the Bookmark skill was essentially a ""last save."" So for a moment I thought he'd have to go back in time to the first mission and keep the Edgelord alive to bring him over (and only have one minute to change the choice he made). I'm kinda sad the kid is still saying ""I don't want to die."""
11,"Mar 25, 2021",Namwoon Kim wore socks with sandals. What a criminal.
11,"Mar 12, 2021",impressed by his foolishness LMAOOO

11,"Sep 1, 2021","""Deus ex machina"" moment was really funny. Like, they literally called it that way and they don't care. I'm liking this story so I don't care either"
11,"Jan 8, 2021",Simps carrying their crush be like Myeongoh carrying Sangah to the other side of the bridge. XD
11,"Oct 9, 2020","I'm like, totally fangirling over this Webtoon! The idea for this comic is something that I think all us readers and fantasy-lovers imagine may happen to us one day, and the way the plot is being carried out is just fantastic! It is such an amazing concept, and I can't wait to read more!! 😍😍😍"
11,"Oct 8, 2020",Man I'd be pretty pissed if I was killed by the same person twice
11,"Oct 7, 2020","Why does everyone hate the person who saved Sanga? I mean, it was a d*ck move but it made sense. Dokja appears to be getting destroyed. If he is gonna die, let’s not waste energy saving him only to potentially have to kill him later. Only an even number can cross, so with Dokja practically dying, that leaves an even number. I’m not saying he did the right thing, I can just see why he did that. If you don’t agree, let me know why. (I’m just curious)"
11,"Oct 7, 2020",started reading the webnovel because of this and its so good ahkdjsjs can't wait to see the webtoon progress but I'm just scared cause the webnovel is 500+ chapters and I have no idea how long that's gonna take me

11,"Apr 26, 2021",started for coins but man this shit is lit!
11,"Oct 8, 2020",When will we finally see the face of the protagonist. 
11,"Oct 8, 2020","I love the irony in this episode, like he used Namwoon's skill to kill his body!"
11,"Oct 8, 2020",Me knowing what’s going to happen: 👁👄👁
11,"Oct 8, 2020",the only reason I wake up on Wednesdays

11,"Oct 7, 2020",I laughed so hard at the image of him running and carrying Sanga while his leg was dragging behind him XD
11,"Oct 7, 2020",Who’s with me Dokja is actually the main character because he’s the only one who read the book 
11,"Oct 7, 2020","Ah, I too, have a bookmark power. *Bookmarks this webtoon*"
11,"Oct 7, 2020",Is it the guy from the other car?
11,"Oct 7, 2020","What!?  A constellation impressed by his foolishness 😂😂

........ I'm dying to see the protagonist."
11,"Dec 22, 2021",the secretive plotter is impressed with your foolishness 😂
11,"Dec 20, 2021",Ohh so because he is the reader his skills are basically tools related to reading
11,"May 3, 2021",The protagonist must've been one of those overpowered main characters.
11,"Apr 30, 2021","The constellation, The Secretive Plotter, is impressed by your foolishness. THIS ONE REALLY GOT ME HAHAHABAABBHAHA"

11,"Dec 23, 2020",I thought that rich boy was about to throw the girl off the bridge. But carrying her across makes way more sense.
11,"Nov 18, 2020",His Bookmark power is very similar to Chrollo's book of nen abilities in HunterxHunter
11,"Oct 21, 2020",Oh! Kim Dokja: Here comes my Idol!
11,"Oct 20, 2020",When you summon your dead enemy as a Stand to kill his reanimated corpse
11,"Oct 16, 2020",“impressed by your foolishness” lol 
11,"Oct 14, 2020",Did anyone else notice that Namwoon was wearing freaking slides and socks?
11,"Oct 9, 2020",Reminder that TWSA stands for three ways to survive the apocalypse
11,"Oct 8, 2020",Is it a bird? is it a plane? IT'S A DUDE I DON'T KNOW!
11,"Oct 8, 2020",That guy that ran away is a jerk
11,"Oct 8, 2020","I'm curious to find out more about the bookmark feature! If he can use the same bookmarks again and again, that seems super OP!"
11,"Oct 8, 2020",everyone viewing this comment should go read a breathtaking webtoon called flow
11,"Oct 8, 2020",There’s the real protagonist but Dokja is still the protagonist for me 
11,"Oct 8, 2020","There’s a scroll button there too, so if his understanding is high enough he can literally become anyone in the book. That’s actually really op 
Edit: never mind I saw the other part saying there’s 3 slots. Still op if he can play it right."
11,"Oct 8, 2020","The MC is f*cking op if you haven't read the webnovel. For those who haven't read it, you probably think that Kim Dokja is op because of Bookmark, but the ""real"" MC has a much more op power"
11,"Oct 8, 2020",Most OP character making his way to MC. Dokja: Your late
11,"Oct 7, 2020","H a-- you really want me to wait for the next episode after that-?  Cliffhangers are tearing my heart to pieces. How am i sopposed to live til' the next episode :,)"
11,"Oct 7, 2020",So the more he changes things the less advantage he has since he can't read the profiles of new people he influenced to save.
11,"Oct 7, 2020",Theory: What if the the MC in in TWSA is a different version of our MC?
11,"Oct 7, 2020",I wonder what happened to that girl in the classroom
11,"Oct 7, 2020","even bridge loophole: have 2 people get on the bridge, as they get to the end, one person remains. As one of the 2 steps off the bridge, the remaining person gets on and then crosses and gets off with the one who remained "
11,"Oct 7, 2020",Now that I know the whole story it's kind of amusing to to see the comic. I got tired of waiting for next chapter and re read the whole story again.

11,"Aug 24, 2021",I'm surprised it took Dokja that long to figure out his ability didn't work on Sangah and Myeongoh cuz they were originally destined to die. If he changes the world too much he won't know what will happen. Myeongoh was badly injured til it was time to dip then he's superman carrying Sangah.

While I'm rooting for him,I'm still trying to figure out if his total lack of empathy is a tactic to stave off attachment and keep a level head,or if he's an incredibly morally grey protagonist who is becoming more and more self-serving...

11,"Apr 28, 2021",absolutely love this webtoon but I can't help but feel it's been a bit of a cop out so far with how the MC has escaped death. it's too convenient but I'm excited to see what happens next
11,"Apr 28, 2021",Is this the same artist that did HIVE??? love the art an sorry amazing!! great coin spree!
11,"Apr 27, 2021",he's starting to get op

11,"Apr 26, 2021","i thought he was going to ask for their help to bring a rope or something. i mean, if the real main character isn't going to come, then he could just pass it using a rope. though I know it might take some time and might not enough time 🤔🤔🤔"

11,"Apr 16, 2021",His bookmark ability is like exactly like John's from unordinary.
11,"Apr 14, 2021",Ok but the MC looks like Dokja
11,"Apr 8, 2021",That doesn't look like an ichthyosaur even though its a marine rwplite its suppose to looke more like a dolphin than a serpent
11,"Mar 31, 2021","my dad is too strong manhwa is the shortest manhwa of all times. plus, it takes 50 chapters for the mc to show his power to someone. (I know this comment is completely unrelated to thus novel but for some reason I couldn't leave a comment on the website I was reading it and I had to let this out somewhere else:)) )"
11,"Mar 24, 2021","aiyaa, Sung Jinwoo, is that you? 😂😂"
11,"Mar 16, 2021",And what if he uses last of his empty slot from the bookmark ability for the survivor of 3707 cabin? That would be freakingly amazing if he could copy him

11,"Nov 25, 2020",ok... not sure if the secret plotter thinks it was hilarious that he was left behind or if they felt sorry for him...
11,"Nov 25, 2020",lol
11,"Nov 25, 2020",I wonder if he can use he's coin to bring back the edge lord and successful get across?
11,"Nov 16, 2020",The ability to bookmark skills reminds me HCLW's ability to steal skills for an amout of time ! That's a really nice trick which force the character to think of what he can do with what he has already seen.

11,"Oct 25, 2020",Edgelord kid comes back only to get killed by his own power. Also that Bookmark skill is pretty impressive will definitely come in handy when get even crazier I imagine
11,"Oct 24, 2020",secretive plotter is impressed by your foolishness 🤣 demonic judge of fire is touched by your (((selflessness)))
11,"Oct 24, 2020",hxh chrollo as the MC. I like that
11,"Oct 24, 2020","Wow. So Seonga has like priest type powers or something? Oh, no, never mind. Oof, lol, now he needs to re-kill Namwoon! Ah, so non-original characters are his weakness then? Bookmark? Sounds powerful. And it looks like things are going crazy! "
11,"Oct 19, 2020",I hate Myeongoh Han and that could be mean of me since he would've died if he stayed but he can't seem to grasp the world they now live in and even dares to talk about work. I mean don't grasp it so well like the edge lord but don't barely grasp it that you can even think about work😑
11,"Oct 18, 2020",That bookmark skill is giving me Phantom vibes from Maplestory
11,"Oct 17, 2020",This is so underrated..😢 Its gives you goosebumps😍🔥

11,"Oct 17, 2020",well I was wrong....
11,"Oct 17, 2020",I wonder if he can remove bookmarks and replace them. I hope so because his first one probably isn’t gonna cut it.
11,"Oct 17, 2020",A JOJO REFERENCE LOL NOW I AM REALLY HOOKED 
11,"Oct 16, 2020",i'm exited fir this character!!! 
11,"Oct 16, 2020",Im here for the coins but later ill comeback to read it
11,"Oct 16, 2020",I wish he’d speak up more and help the other players more! Like he read the book and that’s a huge advantage
11,"Oct 16, 2020",I'm confused.  the bookmark lets him copy abilities?
11,"Oct 16, 2020",Sanga probably made a pact with that secretive constellation 
11,"Oct 16, 2020",groan? groan? look at that zombies being confused... lol
11,"Oct 16, 2020","Sorry, but that's so dumb. Kim's head exploded, be suddenly he had it back? And the zombies are mindless, so why make him speak? I like this Webtoon, but why stray from the novel?"

11,"Oct 8, 2020",This Comic amazing 
11,"Oct 8, 2020",Yes!
11,"Oct 8, 2020","Ok, I'm ""DEFINITELY"" Hooked. "
11,"Oct 8, 2020","I’m confused, what does the bookmark do?"
11,"Oct 8, 2020",Thanks
11,"Oct 8, 2020",Does his bookmark skill remind anyone of chrollo lucifer from hunterxhunter? Which is lit!!!
11,"Oct 8, 2020",I didn't know being a reader would definitely become a very liable asset.
11,"Oct 8, 2020",And now he's a blue mage.
11,"Oct 8, 2020",didn't dokja already choose a constellation a few episodes ago? well I don't really know how it works though lol
11,"Oct 8, 2020",Wait this just got released today?! 
11,"Oct 8, 2020","is the protagonist the black cloak guy that was shown in a silhouette in the first chapter? if so, epicccccc"
11,"Oct 8, 2020",For a moment I though that Gilyeong and Hyeonseong were dead :(
11,"Oct 8, 2020",I bet the protagonist is gonna look exactly like him and then he becomes the protagonist😦
11,"Oct 8, 2020",plot twist: The main character is his boss
11,"Oct 7, 2020",who came
11,"Oct 7, 2020","well, the main character appears? xD"
11,"Oct 7, 2020","Had any of you guys watched Hunter x Hunter? The head of the Spider kept a book where he writo the abilities of others after seeing them once. He can then use those powers whenever he wants. I thinks it's similar to that. Which is cool. I'm not saying the author plagiarized it, I'm saying the similarity is cool and keeps me hooked. "
11,"Oct 7, 2020",O HEEEELL YEAAA
11,"Oct 7, 2020",I the autoweb reader will sponsor you...sending 1k coins..
11,"Oct 7, 2020",I'm sorry I laughed 😂 by that scenario too
11,"Oct 7, 2020",I thought the bookmark was a save point!
11,"Oct 7, 2020",I am excited to see who is 'he'?!
11,"Oct 7, 2020",Is- is that his stand ?!?!?!
11,"Oct 7, 2020","Plz take my coins,even though i font have them"
11,"Oct 7, 2020","Now he can pass the bridge!.... Welp, if the MC of the story doesn't kill him.... 😅"
11,"Oct 7, 2020",he has the coolest abilities omfg-
11,"Oct 7, 2020",i don't understand what bookmark means.. ????
11,"Oct 7, 2020",thats badass...
11,"Oct 7, 2020",hmm so does 2 characters have plot armor? probably

11,"Oct 7, 2020",I WANT TI FAST PASS SO BADD B IT I HA E NO MONEYYY
11,"Oct 7, 2020","guessing ""the protagonist"" is dokja. he will prob show up in another body, just like we saw in the cover on the webtoon page and in the prologue."
11,"Oct 7, 2020",Who else wants their name to be a constellation in this webtoon? Cuz I do✋
11,"Oct 7, 2020",that boss of his.. i don’t remember his name but i feel like he would actually be a big help in the future
11,"Oct 7, 2020",In this scenario we will be using the buddy system. Does everyone have their buddy?
11,"Oct 7, 2020",So I couldn't wait for this to update and went to go read the actual story (before they made it into a webtoon) AND IT IS AMAZING! 💕

11,"Oct 7, 2020",initiate first showdown...
11,"Oct 7, 2020",I think I know what the constellations roles are- I think that there like us readers only the owner who can change them and change them into famous or entities with the not knowing. I maybe a constellation called the hyun

11,"Oct 7, 2020",This would be a good anime
11,"Oct 7, 2020","I am shocked seeing Myeongoh's stigma. It shows a lot of continuity in later chapters. (Manhwa only, you will realize this in 5 years, so you guys are probably going to forget this comment.)"

11,"Sep 3, 2020",That bookmark ability is badass. Hunter x Hunter vibes right there as others stated. 
11,"Sep 3, 2020",Reminds me of chrollo ability from hunter x hunter
11,"Sep 3, 2020",How come he is the only one who read this novel!!!!!!!!

11,"Sep 2, 2020",using the coins are worth it
11,"Sep 2, 2020","I don't really care about all the ""Oh man, I used my coins again. I'm in the hole now."" stuff. If you're reading this early you used coins. We get it XD"

11,"Sep 2, 2020",That's a great skill. He is somewhat like Kuroro Lucifuru in Hunter X Hunter 📖
11,"Sep 2, 2020",when you think you're ready for the test but all of a suddenly math has letters
11,"Sep 2, 2020",dang this is a great story holy cow. 
11,"Sep 2, 2020",I wonder if he can use the bookmarked skill of anyone he meets.  If he can only have 3 at a time do you have to “delete” one to be able to use or save another?
11,"Sep 2, 2020","If I had the power to be master of time and space, I think I might freeze time, and look into the future to read all the books, webnovels, webcomics, and manga I’d want. No need to eat or sleep since time would be frozen. "
11,"Sep 2, 2020",time to see another version of himself
11,"Sep 2, 2020",All hail the protagonist!!!

11,"Oct 7, 2020","Dear authors, I know this may not reach you, but if possible, could you please tweak the way the ending goes a little?

It isn't that the ending isn't satisfactory, it's that it is a open ending, and as someone with zero imagination, it was hard to deal with. Thank you for your hard work thus far!"

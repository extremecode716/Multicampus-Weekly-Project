Episode,Date,Review
6,"Aug 19, 2020","Oh shit, instead of chuunibyou he’s an edgelord 😂"
6,"Aug 19, 2020",they really went and called knw an edgelord 😭😭
6,"Aug 19, 2020",I see I am not the only one who spent coins here
6,"Aug 26, 2020","Imagine having ""edgelord"" as an attribute"
6,"Aug 27, 2020",If someone had hand sanitizer and used it to kill germs would that fill the requirement of killing a living organism?
6,"Aug 26, 2020","Why did webtoon have to get me into this comic where there were so few episodes? I need to binge this.
 *Edit* For those saying I should read the novel, I started it a while ago and am already at like chapter 240. It is very worth it because the character development is incredible. Highly worth reading and I honestly don't even know if the comic will show it off as well, but I'm still looking forward to a lot of the scenes getting illustrated "
6,"Aug 26, 2020",Did I just use the coins I got from the event in which I have to read this on this? Yes. Yes I did. I regret nothing.
6,"Aug 26, 2020",Bet he kept a bug for her...
6,"Aug 28, 2020","I can imagine one of the survivors asking the delusional demon his attribute and him responding ""I'm edgy"""
6,"Sep 2, 2020",imagine a game insulting you by calling you an edgelord.
6,"Aug 26, 2020",I killed a spider. When do I get my 300 coin reward? I need to fast pass more chapters! 
6,"Aug 19, 2020",Raise your hand if you used your free coins here <(￣︶￣)↗
6,"Aug 19, 2020",never thought people's lives would be on insects 🤔
6,"Aug 26, 2020",I feel like I just screwed myself by coming here now I have to wait twice as long 💀💀
6,"Aug 31, 2020","""edgelord""? lmao how am I suppose to take him seriously with a title like that"
6,"Sep 2, 2020",attribute: edgelord (generic) lmao
6,"Sep 2, 2020","Wow, they called him out, huh. “Edgelord (Generic).” Fucking rip, my dude."
6,"Sep 2, 2020","I don't understand why does this webtoon have this low number of views. This is way better than unordinary also. The art is magnificent, chapters are long and something actually happens in this. "
6,"Sep 3, 2020",I'm so glad he gave the kid an insect. imagine having the key to surviving and someone steals it before you find out
6,"Aug 26, 2020",I see that he has a brain
6,"Aug 26, 2020",who here is spending coins from an event because they are too broke to afford them irl? lol
6,"Aug 26, 2020","I finished the coin event only to spend them on this chapter, sneaky. (It was worth it anyways)."
6,"Aug 26, 2020",bye 5 coins I just won o(-(
6,"Feb 5, 2021",Shun Kaido... finally snapped after Dark Reunion tormented him one too many times. Now his chuunibyou fantasies are a reality. I salute you Jet Black Wings. 
6,"Sep 2, 2020",I don't hate true beauty but I don't know why it's more popular then webtoons like this this one I literally don't understand .True beauty is just a normal  story and awesome webtoons like this are highly underrated.
6,"Sep 2, 2020",Wish I could squash bugs just to get 100 coins for this series
6,"Sep 2, 2020",Wait what did he give the kid?
6,"Aug 27, 2020",who else used the 5 free coins that they just got?
6,"Aug 19, 2020",Namwoon Kim is kinda hot 💕 
6,"Aug 26, 2020","Free coins for reading this? Already spent, on reading more of this."
6,"Sep 4, 2020",I think what he’s smiling about is knowing he has power in his hands and that he can control people and change and do things with that power. It makes sense since he always felt like he was a forgettable powerless person all his life because of the bullying and not being anything special to the world 
6,"Aug 26, 2020",Thanks to the free coins I'm a week early
6,"Sep 2, 2020",Hes like a Kaidou that has been posessed by the dark reunion 
6,"Sep 2, 2020","everyone talking abt the kid, if you paid attention you can see he gave the kid a bug "
6,"Aug 27, 2020",My free 5 coins from the event have been well spent 😌
6,"Sep 3, 2020",Guys Do Like The Series It Will Help Author To Keep Going At It And Popularity Will Increase On Webtoon Too !!!!!!
6,"Sep 2, 2020",i wish this could update at least two times a week. at this rate we're here for the next five years 
6,"Sep 2, 2020",all this is fine but i don't want to end up in an apocalypse after i finish the end of this webtoon 😔👉👈
6,"Sep 2, 2020",Guys let me just tell you that this story is going to be godly!!! I have been reading the novel for the past week now and so far I have just reached like chapter 160 of the light novel.The story is one of the most incredible things ever written and the bests survival story ever told!! From here onwards it only gets more insane from the story to the chracters to the events... I am telling you this will be big when it gets 100 chapters of the webtoon!! I can’t wait for you to experience the rest!!
6,"Aug 29, 2020","I just remembered, he said she wasn't the main heroine and ran...did he just leave her for dead hahahaha🤭🤣😅"
6,"Aug 28, 2020",I may have spent 5 coins but I have 15 more

6,"Sep 2, 2020",the way half the audience called that they would be fine if they just killed a bug lol

6,"Sep 4, 2020",If you didn't notice he let a living insect in the child's hands 😢😊
6,"Sep 4, 2020",What I like about him is that he’s not your typical protagonist but as time goes on I can definitely see his protagonist qualities come out naturally later
6,"Sep 2, 2020",plot twist- the author is actually warning us for a similar apocalypse.. you know like how the TWSA author warned dokjaa 😳😳
6,"Sep 2, 2020",No bugs for his HR lady friend??
6,"Aug 28, 2020",I think he gave the kid a bug too. Glad he did that!
6,"Aug 19, 2020","the novel is awesome, but I feel bad for the webtoon-only readers because there's already been a few things left out, as well as inconsistencies. (did anyone notice they changed ""old man"" to ""lady"") yea. GL to other novel readers, the tls are getting worse"
6,"Sep 2, 2020",Hopefully he kept one of the insects for the girl. Kinda want her to live too.
6,"Sep 2, 2020",As someone who's read the entire light novel.... this is barely the beginning of how awesome Dokja is 
6,"Aug 26, 2020",Welp my only coins are gone
6,"Aug 19, 2020",squashing a bug with his bare hands... that itself takes true guts and ability....
6,"Aug 26, 2020",Is it just me or this chapter was too short?
6,"Jul 21, 2021",LMAOAO WHATS HE GONNA DO NEXT? JOIN THE DARK REUNION?

6,"Aug 31, 2021",That poor old lady. She couldn't defend herself so they thought she didn't deserve to live :( i'm glad the stopped hurting her but she's probably going to die :(((
6,"Jun 12, 2021",must be the work of dark reunion 
6,"May 13, 2021",The novel's better in this scene. Edge Lord won't cover it. He's definitely a punk wth chuunibyou.

6,"Mar 22, 2021","Or they could just kill an organism by smudging sanitizer on the floor of the subway. I mean, bacteria are an organism. Plus, they’d get THOUSANDS or MILLIONS of coins since they killed so many bacteria. So, someone’s bound to have sanitizer in that cabin."
6,"Mar 18, 2021","you know it's gonna be good when the first description of a character starts with ""a teenage edgelord"""
6,"Mar 14, 2021",They just dropped the e word like that 😂

6,"Oct 17, 2020",Namjoon is crazy 😬😱

6,"Oct 14, 2020",how bout the girl he was with?
6,"Sep 25, 2020","Chuuninyou and edgelord are totally different tho, i think the word chosen is inaccurate. Edgelord is someone who speaks to shock others in order to look cool, while chuunibou acts lie a know it all and believe they have powers/meant for something greater that others don’t."
6,"Sep 17, 2020",why does namoon remind me of bakugou?
6,"Sep 13, 2020","I would be like Namwoon a bit. I would still think rationally(by killing bugs and insects), but I don't have strong morals. So I'd be a rational, but adapt very quickly. I've been preparing for these types of things for a long time as well. thanks a lot Walking Dead game💀 remember people, the zombies will be able to run. They would only walk once their body became to decay from humidity or heat. "

6,"Sep 4, 2020",And what happened with the girl?
6,"Sep 4, 2020",this why I think outside of the box always. kill the bugs not people. if u really think about they could have killed a plant too
6,"Sep 4, 2020",I should have kept my free coins to fastpass this...
6,"Sep 3, 2020","that ""attribute: edgelord (generic)"" killed me lmao"
6,"Sep 3, 2020","You see, I am no ordinary edgelord."
6,"Sep 3, 2020","I'm just wondering why the webtoon is behind in terms of posting new chapters. Even with the fast pass (paying coins) you can read upto chapter 13 but on other sites you can read upto chapter 20. Since this is the official platform, shouldn't it be released here first? How are the other websites getting access to the new chapters?"
6,"Sep 3, 2020","bruh, after reading this ep (i got no coins to spare), i went to fb and this popped in my page posted 5h ago, ""How to survive the apocalypse, 14 likely scenarios."" yeah, dude I'm good. (┛ಠ_ಠ)┛彡┻━┻"
6,"Sep 3, 2020",SO THIS WAS THE ONLY THING ME AND ALMOST ALL READERS WERE THINKING AND SAYING............just smash inscetsLol(͡°͜ʖ͡°)

6,"Sep 2, 2020",No one’s gonna talk about those poor bugs🥺
6,"Sep 2, 2020","That shot of everyone with their eyes red was superb.
I know he said he has an idea of what attributes he must have but I was really hoping to see them listed out right now.
Also.... Different CONSTELLATIONS are involved? Are they like a sponsor???? Damn "
6,"Sep 2, 2020",lol he didn't give a bug to the girl he was with😭😭
6,"Sep 2, 2020","I saw constellations, that definitely means a higher power is at worl here, maybe they're like gods of the game"
6,"Sep 2, 2020","Just so you know...if this turns into a 3,000 page book, and someone find reads it.. I will hunt you and kill your first during the apocalypse "

6,"Sep 3, 2020","👁️👄👁️OMG I can't believe I'm so smart!!! They said to just kill a living ""organism"", right??? So they could just rub their hands on the floor or somehow get them dirty, and then use a hand sanitizer or a handwash!!!!! In that way, no one will have to die!!!! ✧\(>o<)ﾉ✧"
6,"Sep 2, 2020","If someone had hand sanitizer to kill germs, would that count as a living organism?"
6,"Sep 2, 2020",so I literally could have whipped out hand sanitiser and killed se bacteria and I could be saved?
6,"Sep 2, 2020",You know they could have just sprayed some hand sanitizer and killed a few million bacteries in one shot
6,"Aug 21, 2020","This series is too good 😫 I went from young and dumb to young, dumb, and broke 🤣"

6,"Mar 10, 2021",It seems dark reunion has come at last 😧
6,"Mar 9, 2021","technically everyone has already killed an organism, because bacteria in your body are organisms. and our cells kill them. thus the mandate is filled?"

6,"Feb 20, 2021","""Edgelord (Generic)"" lmfao they didn't have to do the man dirty like that"

6,"Oct 21, 2020",so... did he save an insect for Sanga or did he just basically dumped her?
6,"Oct 18, 2020","THAT'S RIGHT THE BOY HAD CRICKETS and did Dokja hand one of them to the boy? THAT'S SO SWEET💗 I WOULD'VE DONE THE SAME, they were his crickets anyways and I would've wanted the boy to live since he's young🥺.... I swear folks I am way too sweet to be trying to survive in a Apocalypse 😅😂"
6,"Oct 16, 2020",If sanga dies its going down.
6,"Oct 16, 2020",ok ok am i the only one who accidentally read wrong for like a few seconds and thought his name was kim namjoon?
6,"Oct 15, 2020",I really think Dokja is the HIM or HE in the story and will survive and be the hero!
6,"Oct 14, 2020","if anyone has some hand sanitizer, you could always just kill some bacteria. public transportation can be pretty filthy"
6,"Oct 9, 2020",Namwoon just strikes me as a dark side Bakugou

6,"Aug 19, 2020",anyone else bothered by the fact that it says they have to take “more than one life” when it should be “one or more”? there’s a big difference there

6,"Jul 8, 2021","You know what they say, the only ones who survive are the main characters and the ones closet to them. "
6,"Jul 2, 2021",Imagine all the passengers including Dokja pushing and climbing over one another just so they could wash their hands so as to kill numerous bacteria as the scenario says to kill an organism. 🙂
6,"Jun 20, 2021",Ok but what happened to the girl? 👀

6,"Apr 30, 2021",Dojka was thoughtful enough to let the kid keep one of his bugs before letting everyone else fight for the rest. 😣 But I wanted him to give a bug to Sangah too. 😒 It's better if he can keep people he could trust.
6,"Apr 30, 2021",KAIDOU?????!!

6,"Apr 27, 2021","Lol if they had sanitizer, they all could have passed since they would each have been killing thousands or hundreds of thousands of living organisms each, giving them way too many extra points to get a head start. tbh, it's not wise to share this info as people like namwoon kim would survive and get hella strong and hard to deal with but, it's still a big brain strategy "
6,"Apr 27, 2021",delusional demon?teenage edgelord? white hair? is this kaidou from saiki k.?
6,"Apr 27, 2021",*throws bugs* edgelord : join meeeee

6,"Oct 29, 2020",hi
6,"Oct 24, 2020","Oh hey. He made the connection. Good for him. And I get the sense that the main cast is going to find themselves very fascinated by him. Hmm. So Namwoon is a sociopath, right? "
6,"Oct 19, 2020",BUT WHAT BOUT SANGA? COULD HAVE SAVED A CRICKET FOR HER
6,"Oct 17, 2020",the art is great 🥰

6,"Oct 14, 2020","why does that ""edgelord"" looks like Kaidou from ""The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.""? is this the work of dark reunion!?"
6,"Oct 14, 2020","Should have used antiseptic, killing thousands of living organisms would be easy"
6,"Oct 14, 2020",Yoo why does he look like shun from Saiki 
6,"Oct 14, 2020",That kid is traumatized.
6,"Oct 9, 2020",is it just me? or does the edgelord remind me of Kaidou from Disasterous life of Saiki?

6,"Sep 4, 2020",I love this book already. 
6,"Sep 3, 2020",I love the little bit of irony that you have to pay for this

6,"Sep 2, 2020","I died at ""he's no oridinary edge lord"" 😂 love it. "
6,"Sep 2, 2020",Solo leveling vibes
6,"Sep 2, 2020","That was a good intervention. But I'm curious about the butterfly effect now. Because once events diverge too much from the novel, his advantage will be gone. That being said, he will still have knowledge about the world and how it functions. "
6,"Sep 2, 2020",you guys are lucky you can get fastpass
6,"Sep 2, 2020",But.... Namwoon Kim hasn't killed anything yet + the tswa guy abandoned the girl...... In any case this webtoon is AMAZING
6,"Sep 2, 2020",did he forget about his freind
6,"Sep 2, 2020","I saw the notification and I was like ""YESSS a new episode!"" but then I remembered I already paid for this one..."
6,"Sep 2, 2020",So like.. a chuuni?

6,"Sep 2, 2020",LOL I DONT THINK I'D BE PROUD TO HAVE A TITLE LIKE 'EDGELORD'!!! I am the deceased one. 😭
6,"Sep 2, 2020",I started reading this for an event but can't leave because of its art and story plot! 
6,"Sep 2, 2020",Am I the only one wondering what happened to the kid who had the insects🤔
6,"Sep 2, 2020",What about the girl? Did he save a bug for her?
6,"Sep 2, 2020",B-but did he keep a bug for the girl or...?
6,"Sep 2, 2020",Attribute: Edgelord (Generic). Fuckn HAA--.
6,"Sep 2, 2020",Hol up. We have this dude with his omniscience power. He can see the novel. But. He never took himself into account. What if he makes a change like saving a character's life or killing a character? That would cause the butterfly effect and the future would change. Would his power account for that? If not he might just want to lay low so his power will still be a thing.
6,"Sep 2, 2020",guys I'm sorry but what is edgelord 😂
6,"Sep 2, 2020",edgelord huh!?
6,"Sep 2, 2020",this namwoon guy is a lot like bakugo
6,"Sep 2, 2020",I knew it... There was a loophole but obviously people are sick and they thought it should be humans... Anyways I like where this is going...👀
6,"Sep 2, 2020",almost like the gamer but different in a interesting way
6,"Sep 2, 2020","ah, sh*t that was so intense "

6,"Sep 2, 2020",i wonder how many people (other than me) couldnt stand the wait and went and read the novel
6,"Sep 2, 2020",so our protagonist is unhinged and kills bugs by squishing them with his bare hands. noted. 
6,"Sep 2, 2020",Edgelord (generic)

6,"Aug 20, 2020","HMMM, This webtoon is gonna be a COIN EATER.💸💸💸"
6,"Aug 19, 2020",Why do I read his name as Kim Namjoon? 
6,"Aug 19, 2020","Hi, new reader here 👋 So let’s say that the MC in the novel really does exist at the same time as our current MC. If that’s the case, I have a theory that with our main guy changing up the story, it’s possible that he’s either playing as the real hero while the original guy turned antagonist OR the main guy will become the real villain of this story and that’s when the original protagonist comes in. "
6,"Aug 19, 2020",I had to spent coins 😤😤
6,"Aug 19, 2020",this artwork reminds me of solo leveling

6,"Aug 19, 2020",poor bugs  :(
6,"Sep 7, 2020",Am I the only one making billions of coins by using hand sanitizer and killing millions of bacteria cause bacteria are living organisms
6,"Apr 29, 2021","Namwoon looks like Kaidou from saiki k.😭 also, I hope him and dokja are able to make a partnership and work to together. If dokja can understand situations faster and think of a plan, namwoon can carry that out. Edit: never fucking mind. damnit!! now I'm sad😭😭"

6,"Sep 2, 2020","Just fyi, anyone like me who’s obsessed with this particular manhwa since episode 1 - english webtoon is very retarded as usual. So if you’ve fastpassed til ep 12 and still want more, other websites have uploaded up to ep 20"
6,"Sep 2, 2020","I'm so obsessed with this!! It's so underrated, ever since the first three chapters came out I've been thinking about and excitedly waiting for a new chapter every week- it's already one of my faves along with Spirit Fingers and Lost in Translation"
6,"Sep 2, 2020",I hate the namwoon guy
6,"Sep 2, 2020",Hold on... if they only have to kill one living organism why not like I don’t know bight a part of their skin off and kill some cells since those are considered living organisms or am I thinking about this waaay to hard

6,"Sep 2, 2020",Namwoons name really be reminding me of Namjoons 's
6,"Sep 2, 2020",using fast pass on this just rips you off 
6,"Sep 2, 2020",so that's what Lee Gilyoung looks like o:
6,"Sep 2, 2020",Ree.
6,"Sep 3, 2020",Can't someone cough onto an object or spit on it and then use sanitizer for that object? Since bacteria/germs are living things and hand sanitizer kills them (or at least a part/majority of them). 
6,"Apr 27, 2021",don't you all just love it when the penalty for your failure is death. it is just so great right
6,"Oct 16, 2020",i wish if it was reality😭

6,"Sep 2, 2020","""omni-"" I HAVE ARRIVED"
6,"Nov 18, 2021",these episodes got really short.  like started with a good long one . now we just get snacks
6,"Sep 4, 2020",The GAMER???
6,"Sep 3, 2020",Damn yall gonna charge us coins for something you can read for free online? 
6,"Sep 2, 2020",should i spoil some shit
6,"Sep 2, 2020",I feel like this story would have been so much better without the game mechanisms.
6,"Sep 2, 2020",He probably was listing to his edge Lorca playlist before the train havoc began lol
6,"Sep 2, 2020",I can’t believe I have to wait another god damned week. F*ck the corporate overlords at webtoon 
6,"Sep 8, 2020","Haha, Dokja killed the mother bug, so he got a lot more points. Since there were babies as well. This kind of spoiler is fine, right? "
6,"Sep 3, 2020",if there's 7 chapter's ready to go why not just release them instead of them being stuck behind a paywall. I understand when it's like 3 chapters ahead but 7 seems way to much. I love this series that's why it sadness me to see it take so long to come out. 
6,"Sep 6, 2020",lol up to episode 19 is free to read online bruh😆😆
6,"Sep 3, 2020","pssssst yall there are scans/translations up to chapter 19 if you look online, plus the novel is even better "
6,"Sep 2, 2020",Why do they have so many in fast pass! Are they unable to post a WEBTOON twice a week like other great toons. They would have many more views if they updated twice a week.
6,"Sep 2, 2020",there are 19 episode of this in other websites
6,"Sep 2, 2020",that was way to short I'm kinda sad the author made the episodes longer 🙃still a pretty good Webtoon so far 😁
6,"Sep 7, 2020",agh.. really? calling them edgelords is cringe.and really makes the story lose seriousness . disappointing 
6,"Sep 3, 2020",don't get me wrong I like the webtoon but it has a lot of similarities to Solo Levelling so far. I mean the similar artstyle isn't a bad thing but it shares a lot of themes and I hope this doesn't become unoriginal
6,"Sep 6, 2020","Btw you can read up too ch 20 online, don't waste your coins "

6,"Sep 3, 2020",if there's 7 chapter's ready to go why not just release them instead of them being stuck behind a paywall. I understand when it's like 3 chapters ahead but 7 seems way to much. I love this series that's why it sadness me to see it take so long to come out.

6,"Sep 2, 2020",Why do they have so many in fast pass! Are they unable to post a WEBTOON twice a week like other great toons. They would have many more views if they updated twice a week.

6,"Sep 2, 2020",that was way to short I'm kinda sad the author made the episodes longer 🙃still a pretty good Webtoon so far 😁
6,"Sep 7, 2020",agh.. really? calling them edgelords is cringe.and really makes the story lose seriousness . disappointing 
6,"Sep 3, 2020",don't get me wrong I like the webtoon but it has a lot of similarities to Solo Levelling so far. I mean the similar artstyle isn't a bad thing but it shares a lot of themes and I hope this doesn't become unoriginal

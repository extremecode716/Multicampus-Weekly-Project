Episode,Date,Review
76,"Oct 27, 2021","Bruh, dokja is getting straight up bullied in this chapter."
76,"Oct 27, 2021","Haha well it's fitting that Dokja eat a piece of humble pie from time to time. Dude knocked the ""main"" character into the shadow realm, pummeled a lycan, and just had this freakish guide bow down to him dogeza style. EDIT: ""Ima break the 4th wall and down vote this hater."" --Dokja ""lame name"" Kim and other bored constellations"
76,"Oct 27, 2021","suyeong ü§ù me, laughing our asses off"
76,"Oct 27, 2021",‚ÄúYou‚Äôre hopeless and talentless‚Äù it‚Äôs okay Dokja we can all relate
76,"Oct 27, 2021","Wait, but he can bookmark and copy the skills of people he forms a connection with right? So what if he just needs to befriend Lycaon and then bookmark the way of the wind?"
76,"Oct 27, 2021",Not KDJ helping Lycaon reach higher enlightenment when he himself can't use the skill üíÄ
76,"Oct 27, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb "" relates to the incarnation ""KDJ"" for being a fellow slow learner. ] [5 coins have been sponsored. ]"
76,"Oct 27, 2021",when you give tutor to your classmate and they ended up getting better scores than you
76,"Oct 27, 2021",this chapter showing off how fiction supernatural power description are useless to us üò≠
76,"Oct 27, 2021",Sooyoung is really just eating popcorn and laughing at Dokja‚Äôs failures huh. I love her
76,"Oct 27, 2021","I think that he can't actually do the magic because of the 4th wall, since he see the world like a show, would be similar to us trying to do the magic, we know what to do, but we are not part of his world"
76,"Oct 27, 2021","[Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" will spread the the tale of ' Dokja: the useless airbender']"
76,"Oct 27, 2021",Dokja: do this impossible thing. Doesn't make sense right?Lycaon: ü§Ø Thanks for teaching me this absolutely broken skill!
76,"Oct 27, 2021",an entire episode almost dedicated to messing with KDJ
76,"Oct 27, 2021","I'm with Suyeong on this one. Sorry KDJ, but this is hilarious"
76,"Oct 27, 2021",dokja has a thing for people kneeling before him huh
76,"Oct 27, 2021",Finally Bihyeong is back üíï the fluffy little devil
76,"Oct 27, 2021",hsy laughing her ass off at kdj's expense is a whole mood 
76,"Oct 27, 2021","You know, for a reader, Dokja be lacking imagination"
76,"Oct 27, 2021",kdj trying to learn [Way of The Wind] is me trying to solve math problems 
76,"Oct 27, 2021","I was so ready to say how badass Dokja is, but he just got bullied. ü§£"
76,"Oct 28, 2021",The constellation the prisoner of the golden headband is amazed at how pathetic you are üòÇüòÇ this was one of my favourite chap even in novel poor dokja hahahaha 
76,"Oct 27, 2021",Well if it isn't our old friend
76,"Oct 27, 2021",We all have a friend like Suyeong
76,"Oct 27, 2021","""Useless Disciple"" üòÇ"
76,"Oct 27, 2021",i can't with hsy laughing her ass off at kdj they're so chaotic
76,"Oct 27, 2021","The way of the wind said, No‚ù§ "
76,"Oct 27, 2021",Wait I thought he can copy skills. Won‚Äôt he just have to form a connection with the big wolf dude
76,"Oct 27, 2021",I love this. since about 45 I've been reading the web novel and I'm so excited. we're almost to the point where the story gets so interesting to me personally and I can not wait for the rest. I've read the web novel 3 times since then and currently in a 4th read through because I can't find anything else more interesting for me to read (I read on my work breaks on my phone) highly recommend reading the web novel if you're not afraid to move away from the visuals! this is going to be awesome.
76,"Oct 27, 2021",Our favorite vanilla cake lookin short stack is back <33
76,"Oct 28, 2021","Poor dokja. He has all the ingredients to the cake, but he just cannot bake it. Also, I love Han Sooyung's reactions lmao, she's really starting to grow on me. "
76,"Nov 3, 2021",It's refreshing to see Dokja can't straightforwardly master a new skill. That way he looks more human üòÖ
76,"Oct 27, 2021","It‚Äôs nice how Dokja is an OP protagonist but like. It‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs not because it‚Äôs HIM that he‚Äôs OP. He‚Äôs clever and knows the world but like, he‚Äôs not Joonghyuk."
76,"Oct 27, 2021",Pls the artists were flexing their hand drawing and lighting skills so hard here. Im not complaining tho coz this looks SUPERB
76,"Oct 28, 2021","in trying to make impossible examples, he's leading ppl to epiphanies üòÇ"
76,"Dec 1, 2021",‚ÄúI almost died last time‚Äù bro you DID die fighting the dragon you came back to life sure but you DID die lol üòÇ
76,"Oct 27, 2021",I'm guessing it's a bi-product of [Fourth Wall]. Dokja is effectively trying to learn the Kamehameha from reading a book.
76,"Oct 28, 2021","how can you be so smart and dumb too? haha it's funny cause it seems like he's not thinking in terms of magic or whatever, he's like that's impossible I'm like nah that makes sense in a world where shit is hatched from a meteorite"
76,"Oct 27, 2021",Only the Avatar master of all four elements could stop the five catastrophes üòÇ 
76,"Oct 27, 2021",Dokja when he manages to level up a new companion within the next 10 min of saying metaphors: üëÅüëÑüëÅ
76,"Oct 27, 2021","I‚Äôd like to think of this as some modern human memorizing all the great works of philosophers through world history, but doesn‚Äôt know Jack s**t about philosophy and just memorized stuff, then going back in time to other philosophers just to wisdom dump then with profound knowledge you don‚Äôt even understand"
76,"Oct 27, 2021",not gonna lie was missing bihyeong.
76,"Dec 1, 2021","Dokja forgets that he's a reader of the novel, not an actual character let alone the main one üòÖ in other words, he can recite the words used to describe the skill but he hasn't built the actual skill to understand its power. All his skills are acquired from his reader knowledge, maybe this will need a reader approach, not a character approach? "
76,"Oct 28, 2021",I am glad that Dokja can't do everything he knows about in the book. Makes me like him more as a character
76,"Oct 27, 2021","Bihyeong is here AHHH!! üòÜ Dokja, your name is not lame, look it's part of of the title of this amazing story! ü§çü§çü§ç Also, use your head a little more and you'll realize your 'potential' and 'strength' GOGOGO üòÜüñ§"
76,"Oct 27, 2021",AND WHERE THE H*** HAS BIHYEONG BEEN!
76,"Oct 27, 2021","Poor baby can't learn rnüò¨ü§£He's speaking ""gibberish"" but it's giving the guy enlightenment. Also ""You're not even the main character"" girl...that's where you're ‚ú®wrong‚ú® Dokja is the best main character because he's so relatable to us readers who read to escape our lives and who read to feel some sense of peace in a way"
76,"Dec 1, 2021","Dokja‚Äôs faces are hilarious. I think when he says the instructions are metaphors, he‚Äôs holding himself back since he doesn‚Äôt believe in it, so the magic doesn‚Äôt work"
76,"Oct 27, 2021","Refreshing to see the know-it-all, OP Dokja come back to reality. Great twist "
76,"Dec 1, 2021",hate to admit but i missed bihyeong
76,"Dec 1, 2021",He said he almost died back then‚Ä¶ HE DID DIE??¬ø¬ø??
76,"Dec 1, 2021","Learning actual magic is difficult man! Even parlor magic takes hours! All this time, you've been using equips and system bonuses to survive, but magic is very different!"
76,"Oct 27, 2021",dokja sounds badasswhy does he put himself down so much?
76,"Dec 1, 2021",Wolf: it‚Äôs not a metaphor KDJ: so why are they all metaphors???
76,"Dec 1, 2021",Man Dokja really be having a Korra moment here lol
76,"Dec 1, 2021",Dokja really went from telling the wolf dude to kneel to helping him achieve enlightenment HAHAHA
76,"Dec 1, 2021","To better understand some terms used in this episode, look up a picture of the flag of Korea. The Korean flag uses a Taeguk with red and blue swirls and four of the eight trigrams. A Taeguk represents a state of two contrasting elements united. Each trigram represents heaven, gloss (of metal), fire, thunder, wind, water, rock, and earth. The Korean flag uses four of these (heaven, fire, water, earth). Explanation taken from ORV fan group which I cannot mention here."
76,"Dec 1, 2021",Poor Dokja but he did need a little humbling. üòÇ
76,"Nov 2, 2021","only now i am realizing it, but which ones are these ""three"" ways to survive the apocalypse. earn money, fight whatever comes your way and be hot? /hj  like are we ever gonna find out? do we have to figure it out ourselves or? maybe i missed something "
76,"Oct 27, 2021",AHAHAHA LEMME LOL LIKE SOOYOUNG DID~!!! Poor Dokja's just getting compared so much to Jonghyuk and even  to the prince who got ENLIGHTENED instead of him ;)
76,"Dec 2, 2021",Did you all see the new novel arts of KIM DOKJA? asdfghjkl
76,"Oct 28, 2021","I enjoy Dokja struggling to learn something, it makes him more relatable as a character and is just hilarious ü§£ "
76,"Oct 27, 2021",I‚Äôm gonna laugh so hard if he can‚Äôt do it because of his gloves 
76,"Dec 7, 2021",okay but why is dojka so damn fine 
76,"Dec 7, 2021",I've been reading this nonstop for the last few days and i am literally smitten! the storyline and the characters are so strong and amusing and I'm looking forward to see how everything will go from now on! 
76,"Dec 3, 2021",Dokja here trying to learn air bending and become the next avatar
76,"Dec 3, 2021",my name is so lame? BOII YOUR NAME IS FAMOUS IRL!! and BIHYEONGGG LONG TIME NO SEE YOU LITTLE SHIT
76,"Dec 3, 2021","Understanding the concept is very different than being able to apply it. If you could use a move just because you understood it, I'd be a martial arts master. "
76,"Dec 2, 2021","[The Powerless Viewer is sad to see that he has caught up with the entire story already, despite only starting today. He anxiously awaits the next chapter]"
76,"Oct 27, 2021","I want to see the plagiarizer try it. If she can't do it, then she doesn't deserve to make fun of dokja for not being able to do it lol"
76,"Oct 27, 2021",It‚Äôs only right that Dokja be handicapped in some he‚Äôs been too OP ü§£ü§£
76,"Oct 27, 2021","to master the wind, you must first break the wind."
76,"Dec 1, 2021",bihyeong is back my dudes
76,"Dec 1, 2021","Understanding the concept of a thing and having the talent to do a thing are entirely different, my dear reader. Just as one can critic a work of art even if they themselves couldn't draw a hand to save their life."
76,"Dec 1, 2021",oi but look bihyeong looks so happy to see dokja
76,"Dec 1, 2021","bahaha this is expectations vs reality moment .. well he is  actually a READER , so it's not actually surprising that he won't excel in mastering action skills..he is a reader so he will fight the way reader fights."
76,"Dec 1, 2021",Dokja this is all gibberish it‚Äôs like me saying wind meets wind and makes ying Yang! It doesn‚Äôt make any sense! Lycaon: OMG! You are so profound *Lycaon has leveled up*
76,"Oct 28, 2021",Dokja getting a piece of that sweet humble pie.
76,"Oct 28, 2021",I hope Dokja finds a way to over this  obstacle like using bookmark to mimic Lycaon skill if this can happen all he needs to do is befriend and understand the big wolf sensei
76,"Oct 27, 2021",BIHYEONG IS FINALLY BACK
76,"Oct 27, 2021",HES BACK! Now let‚Äôs see him piss off bihyeong
76,"Dec 7, 2021",i missed bihyeong ü§∫
76,"Dec 6, 2021",Rooting for Joongdok
76,"Dec 5, 2021",Am I the only one a little happy to see Bihyeong again?
76,"Dec 3, 2021","ah yes, loving kim dokja while also want to bully and strangle him at the same time is really one of the few authentic ORV reading experiences"
76,"Dec 2, 2021",Lycaon: a hottie‚Ä¶.. thank you for coming to my Ted Talk
76,"Dec 2, 2021","man, I get Dokja tho, those instructions feel so vague when you're a person who sees things in a way where everything is clear on how things work that its hard to relax and let go of that thought process"
76,"Dec 2, 2021","Bihyeong is finally back! I really like that Dokja didn't magically learnt the skill as the protagonist would, nice detail, he has been doing great because he has been really smart and knows things about the plot but not because he was gifted in the first place, I like that very much. ‚ú®"
76,"Dec 1, 2021",suyeong is having time of her life haha..lol me too
76,"Dec 1, 2021",It's so fun to see Dokja caught off guard instead of playing conman.....And Bihyeong's back! I weirdly missed his face
76,"Dec 1, 2021","""It's not a metaphor"" that's just more confusing"
76,"Dec 1, 2021","""wow, you enlighten me with such a profound comprehension of the skill "" "" BUT I DIDN'T EVEN UNDERSTOOD THE BASICS OF IT!!! """
76,"Dec 1, 2021",Suyeong is such a mood üòÇüòÇüòÇ
76,"Nov 24, 2021","tag yourself in this chapter, i'm sooyoung"
76,"Nov 1, 2021",PFTT not dokja trying to be junghyeok ahahahhhhshshhhaa
76,"Oct 27, 2021",Oh look! The original little shit is back xD
76,"Oct 27, 2021",Now that he mentioned his name is lame I realized it kinda sounds like Dovahkin
76,"Oct 27, 2021",Dokja doesn't understand the assignment
76,"Oct 27, 2021",Dokja is how I feel when someone explains a should-be easy task to me
76,"Dec 18, 2021",this ddeokebi is giving off bestie vibes lmfao
76,"Dec 16, 2021",I love Bihyeong is technically one of the bad guys but none of us take him seriously anymore. 
76,"Dec 8, 2021",OMG FINALLY BIHYEONG IS BACK HATE TO ADMIT BUT I MISS THAT FURRY DEMON 
76,"Dec 7, 2021",I really like reading the manhwa version but kinda wonder how they gonna cover all 500+ chapters. It would take 10 years at least‚Ä¶
76,"Dec 7, 2021","i dont know, but i missed that cute dokkaebi, Bihyeong"
76,"Dec 6, 2021","For a moment I thought he was gonna say ""My name is Yu Junghyeok"" "
76,"Dec 6, 2021",what's dokja so damn pretty for huh? y'all have the audacity to call him ugly?? like have you SEEN his eyelashes like everything about this man is pretty gorgeous
76,"Dec 3, 2021",if only coins could buy you skills
76,"Dec 2, 2021","Lycaon: ""Pay your respects before superior species.""Dokja: *Uno Reverse Symbol... I mean Card*"
76,"Dec 2, 2021","Bro, these are some long ass days"
76,"Dec 2, 2021",Yes a little Bit struggle for a Reader in Skills should be a thing. Since He is only the Main character of Omniscient Reader Not TWSA
76,"Dec 2, 2021",Is it only me or folks is getting hotter and hotter every chapter ???!
76,"Dec 2, 2021","So‚Ä¶ aside from Stigmas and skills obtained as rewards from missions, has our omniscient reader actually learned *any* skills of his own?He might not actually be able to learn skills the traditional way at all"
76,"Dec 2, 2021",Yaaaaaas Bihyeong is BACKKKK!!!!
76,"Dec 2, 2021","I feel like he should probably consider the words literally rather than as metaphors, maybe that might help?"
76,"Dec 2, 2021","This chapter shows the gap between knowledge, skill, and talent. Talent in its truest form is a miracle, skill can mimic true talent after putting true effort and work in, and knowledge is the understanding of how skills should work. Dokja has the knowledge, but he expects to have talent as well. This mirrors how many people see professionals in any field. Sports, medical, writing webnovels. They see something impressive and think talent, when it is practice developing knowledge into skill."
76,"Dec 2, 2021",Then again I don‚Äôt think he fully knows his ability tho. He‚Äôs following just as it was written in the novel but how about his ability. He said it himself he‚Äôs a reader 
76,"Dec 1, 2021",MY BOY BIHYEONG IS BACK
76,"Dec 1, 2021",OK I CANT ANYMORE. I might even die laughing at this rate.
76,"Dec 1, 2021",When a noob reads a cheat guide and teaches the pros while being unable to play the game still. 
76,"Dec 1, 2021",Okay but I ain‚Äôt see them eat anything 
76,"Dec 1, 2021",Lycaon holding the baby destroyed me
76,"Dec 1, 2021",Dokja is gonna need to pull a page from Naruto and create a clone to figure this out lol
76,"Dec 1, 2021","I feel for the lycan, he lost his world and he was carrying a child. That's way too sad man"
76,"Dec 1, 2021",Honestly Dokja Kim is an epic name if you say it powerfully
76,"Dec 1, 2021","You know, I used to hate Bihyeong, but now he's kinda like a homie"
76,"Dec 1, 2021",this was the best episode ever. this boi over here struggling and giving enlightenment to alien tour guides in the same breath ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
76,"Dec 1, 2021",This dude just enlightened a teacher.  Hope neither of them die though
76,"Dec 1, 2021","ah one thing i love about this series, even mc struggle and have limitation"
76,"Dec 1, 2021",All us novel readers are happy for any moment our precious little fur ball shows up‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs so cute but obviously not as cute as biyoo 
76,"Dec 1, 2021",i want to read TWSA now
76,"Dec 1, 2021","The sad thing is Lycaon is still the best guide that we saw üòÖ not to mention Ignir would probably still be a struggle at the 40th scenario, much less the 5th. LOL way of the wind, one of the most useful skills that‚Äôs absolutely impossible for Dokja to learn on his own. Oh, yes, the Disaster of _____ would definitely be hard to face without mastery over that skill! Way of the Wind is simple‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre a prodigy. Or you have a good philosophical head. Eyyy my fave Dokkaebi is back! "
76,"Dec 1, 2021","yall i know dokja, but who the hell is KDJ?"
76,"Nov 27, 2021",The reality of Dokja being talentless but good at living in a fantasy world really hits a soft spot with his character. I guess the 4th wall dosen't work for things he dosen't understand 
76,"Nov 25, 2021",ah our lil' dokkeabi is bac ^^
76,"Nov 25, 2021","Imagine knowing everything there is to know, but also not at the same time, and ending up helping someone else instead of yourself. Oh, right you already know how‚Äôs that feel Dokja."
76,"Nov 24, 2021",not him leading the wolf to enlightenment üò≠üò≠üò≠
76,"Nov 1, 2021","I'm glad to see Dokja struggling like this. Even though he had to overcome great challenges before, it always felt like he was 3 steps ahead of everyone (exceptions being the catastrophe and almost anything related to the renouncers and disciples). "
76,"Oct 27, 2021",poor Dokja. It's okay. You are still the main character in the webtoon we are reading
76,"Jun 17, 2022",Bro is just spouting nonsense and it causes Lycaon to achieve nirvana
76,"Jun 10, 2022",YASSSS dokja's buddy IS BACKKK
76,"Jun 1, 2022",someone please explain me why this is so funny? T_T i dont get it
76,"Mar 7, 2022",i never get tired of orv humor lmao
76,"Feb 27, 2022",bro justice for dokja hes getting bullied real bad in this chapter üíÄüíÄüíÄ

76,"Jan 8, 2022",lol i missed bihyeong
76,"Dec 27, 2021","wow Even monke king and secretive plotter think he's pathetic, these constellations  really taking revenge on homeboy this ain't right"
76,"Dec 22, 2021",That girl having so much fun in this chapter üòÇüòÇ
76,"Dec 17, 2021",hey author your art is looking really good lately üò≥üò≥
76,"Dec 17, 2021","You know what, forget Dokja, Constellation, The Prisoner of Golden Headband... what you doing this weekend?"
76,"Dec 9, 2021",YOOOOOO MY BOY DOKJA BOUTA BECOME AN AIRBENDER üò≥üò≥
76,"Dec 8, 2021",who else missed bihyeong i‚Äôm glad to see his gremlin face again 
76,"Dec 8, 2021",I‚Äôm starting to really like the rip off author. Fun character
76,"Dec 8, 2021","YOOOOOOO HE'S BACKalso, does anyone know a good website or app I could read the novel on?"
76,"Dec 8, 2021",I love this NovelüòÑ been a great time reading. awesome work author üòéü§ì
76,"Dec 5, 2021","Oh, there is a cheat blocking him from being able to perform it."
76,"Dec 5, 2021",Dojka‚Äôs L has turned Suyeong into a hyena 
76,"Dec 5, 2021",dokja in this chapter be like: *receives a so fine art in the beginning and being bullied at the end
76,"Dec 4, 2021",Task Successfully Failed
76,"Dec 3, 2021",Ayeee our boy bihyeong is back!
76,"Dec 3, 2021",This poor man Dokja went from destroying the throne and insulting a Dokkaebi right to its face to being bullied by a plagiariser and a wolf lol.
76,"Dec 3, 2021",Wait so is Lycan gonna save the earth or is he gonna disappear to another world/dimension??
76,"Dec 2, 2021",It's not surprising that he can't do it when he's only been leveling strength and agility stats and neglecting his others. I bet Suyeong has the right stats. I can't get enough of her laughing in the background ü§£
76,"Dec 2, 2021","Sooyoung told Dokja that anger can be separated into 3 categories and she can prove it. She called Jonghyuk‚Äôs number in a high-pitched voice, ‚ÄúHello, is this Kim Dokja I‚Äôm speaking to?‚Äù // Jonghyuk replied over the phone, ‚ÄúSorry, you called the wrong number.‚Äù He ended the call. //Sooyoung said, ‚ÄúThis is the first level of anger; surprise and curiosity.‚Äù
(continue in replies)"
76,"Dec 2, 2021",GAAHH! Bihyeong is back!! Finally! I missed him! Am I the only one?? „Ö†„Ö† 
76,"Dec 2, 2021",Even I don't eat 3 meals a day and sleep for 6 hours how tf is someone in an apocalypse do it

76,"Dec 2, 2021",training arc goes into the ground r.i.p dokja
76,"Dec 2, 2021",Imagine all of this turns out to be a dream of dokja in the end & he wakes up in bed as if nothing happened ü§≠
76,"Dec 2, 2021","Damn poor Dokja, trying for hours to understand the basics and this guy just transcends to grandmaster instantly "
76,"Dec 2, 2021",Im gonna guess that he can't learn it because he's 4th wall meaning that he is thinking this like mechanics in a game and less as a tangible thing that it exists.
76,"Dec 2, 2021",Time to drop my coins!
76,"Dec 2, 2021",dokjas waist....
76,"Dec 2, 2021",I love the series though 
76,"Dec 2, 2021","I dont think Dokja is bad at learning skills, I think it might just be that it is blocked from him as being a reader. Just a theory‚Ä¶"
76,"Dec 2, 2021",ay he's back 
76,"Dec 2, 2021",Luv it
76,"Dec 2, 2021",mf looks so fine in his suit

76,"Dec 2, 2021",so he's trying to become an airbender now nice
76,"Dec 2, 2021",That moment when you‚Äôre the main character but not the main character 
76,"Dec 2, 2021",BIHYEONG IS BACK LES GO! 
76,"Dec 2, 2021",I bet it will be the plagiarist who will have to do the airbending for him.
76,"Dec 1, 2021","Welcome back, Bihyeong! You‚Äôre a scary fluffy stuff toy but you‚Äôre better than the glasses one üòÇüòÇ"
76,"Dec 1, 2021",Han sooyoung is all of us right now ü§£ü§£ü§£ sorry dokja
76,"Dec 1, 2021",This chapter was just pure comedy ü§£ 
76,"Dec 1, 2021",I apologize for laughing Dokja :')
76,"Dec 1, 2021","[Constellation ""Of a Small World"" relates to Dokja]"
76,"Dec 1, 2021",Great now dokja's found family has a dog

Btw, Bibi happens to be my nickname for the fluffiest fluffy fluffer to ever grace Webtoons, Bihyeong. I just love how in the beginning he was a fluffy floating gnome who was ruthless bloodthirsty and menacing, but then he agrees to a contract with Dokja and now hes more like Dokja's coin grubbing pet. Plus I also like how he tries to act natural when Dokjas around."

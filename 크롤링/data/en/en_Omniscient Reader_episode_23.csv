23,"Oct 18, 2020",So happy with all the work the artist puts into these. On top of all the quick releases. Thank you so much! (Thanks for my first top comment guys. This community is golden) 
23,"Oct 18, 2020","Hold on now Gilyeong. We asked you to summon an insect, not Mothra's great granddaddy. "
23,"Oct 18, 2020",Let me guess Gilhyong must be summoning a much higher level insect. lol something tells me this kid is going to be a OP character
23,"Oct 18, 2020",I hope that kiddo is ok next episode. I also hope that curse ends up entertaining for the rest of this webtoon.
23,"Oct 18, 2020","How is no one talking about the constellation ""Eyes waiting for Tuesday Night"" that pops up LOL "
23,"Oct 18, 2020","[The Constellation,  Eager Sunday Reader, nods in approval and gifts you 5 coins]"

23,"Oct 18, 2020",man those constellations are gonna be pissed when they find out they missed out on two huge moments. dokabi's have it rough in dokja's stream
23,"Oct 18, 2020","how is this so damn rewarding? im almost broke damnit. this constellation over here will do everything to keep watching you dokja, ma man"
23,"Oct 18, 2020","I hope Gilyeong won't die so easily. He looks like a character with a lot of potential. Plus, we haven't seen his whole personality yet. "
23,"Oct 18, 2020",Constellation artifact...what a wordy way to say star relic ü§î
23,"Oct 18, 2020",Wait a minute what the kind of name is eyes waiting for Tuesday night that is funny AF
23,"Oct 18, 2020",Ok I can‚Äôt be the only one who think this should be a anime right? 
23,"Oct 18, 2020",Not the cinnamon roll!!
23,"Oct 18, 2020",that's either going to be one seriously big ass bug boss or Gilyhong's about to get a dope ass pet lol
23,"Oct 22, 2020",gilyeong and sanga are mood! their reaction to dokja is so pure ü§£
23,"Oct 18, 2020","No wonder why that demon choose Myeongoh what an evil heart.... Dokja should have just let him go and let him become that demon surrogate..... but that‚Äôs what you get for being selfish, a curse that will follow you till you die"
23,"Oct 18, 2020","Dokja just gets more OP. At this point, he better be the legitimate protagonist."
23,"Oct 20, 2020",IF GILYEONG DIES I WILL PUNCH SOMEONE BECAUSE THAT LITTLE CINNAMON ROLL DOES NOT DESERVE TO DIE
23,"Nov 18, 2020","[THE CONSTELLATION, BROKE AF, USED 5 COINS TO CONTINUE WATCHING AND IS NOW PENNYLESS] "
23,"Oct 18, 2020","constellation ""üëÄ Waiting for Tuesday Night"" we DEFINITELY the constellations"
23,"Oct 19, 2020",I keep wondering if Secretive Plotter is the author of the web novel
23,"Oct 19, 2020",I can smell god tier anime in the air 
23,"Nov 17, 2020","Interesting. So in the Webtoon, Dokja has a general idea what would happen when you receive the demon kings curse. I don‚Äôt remember that happening in the novel and it confused me abit in the novel, good storytelling to explain this now. I assume the novel writer reveled it later on because of their unique storytelling, I love them both- a work by someone who I assume is also a fan of the novel.I love this."
23,"Oct 18, 2020","STAY AWAY FROM MY SON, BUG"
23,"Oct 18, 2020",The thought in each scenario put by the author couldn't be more interesting. I feel that constellations are represented by us who can only hope what will happen next. 
23,"Oct 19, 2020",I wish they would keep updating this daily! Such a amazing piece of art we have here gentlemen!
23,"Oct 18, 2020",Now do I wait a month and some or lose all my money...(the answer is clear)
23,"Nov 25, 2020","dokja: ""okay gilyoung use your cute bug powers and get us out"" gilyoung: *summons god*"
23,"Nov 25, 2020",This is why you study foreign languages ü§∑
23,"Nov 26, 2020","""prisoner of golden headband pull his hair out in excitement"".... Me laugh so much from that.üòÇüòÇüòÇü§£"
23,"Nov 25, 2020","[The constellation ""Shook Emoticon"" wants to watch more but doesn't have coins and just gives moral support.]"
23,"Nov 26, 2020","Let's appreciate how careful Dokja was in defeating the warden. He had only 1 OP slash before the sword broke, and he had to make sure the cut wasn't too shallow nor too deep."
23,"Nov 25, 2020","Oh. I have a policy against killing? XD such an obvious lie. Gilyoung's starry eyes are great. ""Wait guys let me make sure this meat is edible"" *eats the delicious food first* *keeps eating* Well I think it's edible *says between mouthfuls*"
23,"Nov 25, 2020",I absolutely love extremy cunning/intelligent/informed protagonists
23,"Nov 25, 2020",Oooh remember that giant grasshoppe from earlier?I think he contacted that one...Edit:Ah so i was right about it :D
23,"Nov 25, 2020","Wait are we all constellations since we are technically ""watching the channel"" ü§îü§îü§î"

SNAP OUT OF IT KID!!! I RATHER NOT HAVE ANY BUGS THAN YOU TRYING YOUR HARDEST TO THE POINT OF BLEEDING TO CONTROL THAT BIG BUG!!!!"
23,"Nov 25, 2020","I love how the constellations go from being dark, mysterious, and scary figures to each having their own quirky personality and being more down to earth[so to speak] and relatable. I cannot wait to see what they look like!! "
23,"Nov 27, 2020","in the novel instead of Dokja saying ""you you've got to eat to store up energy to fight that curse of yours"" he says something similar to ""You should eat, it'll be your last meal anyway"" which isn't that different but I just found it funnier. no hate tho, I don't really mind. just pointing it out"
23,"Nov 25, 2020",y'know....Dokja kinda scares me.......but in a good way

23,"Nov 26, 2020",I just finish the completed version novel of this series (the one that was translated to english because I don't understand Korean). It is really interesting.

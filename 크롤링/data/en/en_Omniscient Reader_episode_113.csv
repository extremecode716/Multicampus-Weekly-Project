113,"Jul 13, 2022",HE'S HEEEEEERREEEE. GUNDAM BOY IS BEST BOY AAAAHHHHH
113,"Jul 13, 2022",Nice outfit Kim Dokja 👀👀🤭🤭🤭 Edit: The replies 🤣🤣🤣👌👌👌
113,"Jul 13, 2022","Get yourself a man who: ✅ Comes back after dying

Feel free to add more 😩"
113,"Jul 13, 2022",Wow he's helping Dokja? That's pretty unexpected...I thought he was about to throw hands🤣🤣
113,"Jul 13, 2022",Honestly surprised me how cool he is with the man who got him killed haha
113,"Jul 13, 2022",Look on the bright side Dokja: at least you woke up with clothes this time.
113,"Jul 13, 2022","Man he is taking, “I’ve been through hell and back” to another level."
113,"Jul 13, 2022",That panel with Shin Yuseung was just *chefs kiss* 
113,"Jul 13, 2022","HELL WAS SO HOT THAT HE HAD A MAJOR GLOW UP, JUST LOOK AT MY BOY."

113,"Jul 13, 2022","Dokja's doing that eye twitch again, he's so cute TT "
113,"Jul 13, 2022",He seems oddly.. nice.. now….
113,"Jul 13, 2022","Aww, reunions... Nostalgia, jumping to mistaken conclusions, and all that. Namwoon sure looks better in this setting, though. Trying hard to resist using the expression ""death becomes him"", and... oops, fail. 😏"
113,"Jul 13, 2022",i forgot they teased gigantomachia this early omg... ANYWAYS GOOD TO SEE KNW AGAIN!!! WHAT A GLOW UP 💕💕😭
113,"Jul 13, 2022",It's nice seeing Kim Namwoon calm like this.
113,"Jul 13, 2022",it's nice seeing more of Namwoon Kim it's definitely a good thing he died early or else he would've been a lunatic from using his constellation. I do wonder if he'll actually be revived or just there for a small plot point.
113,"Jul 13, 2022",new companion? if he brings him back will he be making the story unfold as it was written? I need more episodes!!!
113,"Jul 13, 2022",Unexpecteded collab and I’m so here for it
113,"Jul 13, 2022","[Constellation ""Dragon of the Peach Tree"" is stunned to see the Delusional Demon once again, and hopes the Dokja can go and show us other after life places.]"
113,"Jul 13, 2022",Why is the No name villain from the first chapter acting buddy buddy all of a sudden 😂
113,"Jul 13, 2022",That Yuseung spread is so gorgeous 😍
113,"Jul 13, 2022","Thanks for prepping me for this, English class and Percy Jackson and Hades 🙏"
113,"Jul 13, 2022",Dokja looks amazing in every single outfit he wears! 😭🥰 I love the sleeveless. HIS SHOULDERS AND ARMS ARE ARHTHTHFJTJR

113,"Jul 14, 2022","I guess he is so lunatic, that he really likes the man who killed him lol"
113,"Jul 13, 2022","I'll be honest, I completely forgot about him till I saw his hair. Kim Namwoon, wtf!"
113,"Jul 13, 2022","Just look at that panel where Gundam Boy licks his lips, he's so cute TT "
113,"Jul 13, 2022",BARK WOOF WOOF ARF MEOW ARF ARF GRRR BARK BARK 
113,"Aug 17, 2022",this man got a character development in hell lmao
113,"Aug 17, 2022","I love how Kim Namwoon is so nonchalant about being dead. He’s making fun of Dokja, helping him, and terrorizing people "
113,"Jul 13, 2022","If this ever gets an anime adaptation, Kim needs to be voiced by the VA who voices Bakugo from mha"
113,"Aug 17, 2022",he change bro is like: you know what im already ded no point on being a bitch💀
113,"Jul 18, 2022","I find it interesting that he's puting his ego and pride aside and said "" where both dead so what ever """
113,"Jul 13, 2022",Dokja's 7th outfit! Idol Dokja canon. 😍
113,"Jul 13, 2022","""HEY GRASSHOPPER MAN!!"" Ah, Kim Namwoon, I'm so curious to see what you were like in the original scenarios. Definitely crazy, but I doubt that it was one-dimensional. "
113,"Aug 17, 2022","""Sorry you didn't get to save your girlfriend"" THAT'S HIS DAUTHER FROM ALTERNATIVE TIMELINE YOU INSENSITIVE WALNUT.
Other than that, I actually like him this time around for now. As they say, war crimes are fictional but being annoying is real."
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Kim Dokja's so pretty it hurts 🤕
113,"Aug 17, 2022",sleeveless kim dokja makes me dizzy 😵
113,"Jul 29, 2022",Kim Namwoon casually having a chat with the person that got him killed is such a mood
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Namwoon seems to be acting really friendly considering  Dokja killed him… I guess hell mellowed him out a little
113,"Aug 17, 2022",namwoon:so killed ya huh?dokja: I am very uncomfortable with the energy we have created in the studio today
113,"Aug 20, 2022",plot twister: he is just being nice to him because he thinks he's actually dead.
113,"Aug 17, 2022",I'm not a novel reader but the moment they mentioned a lunatic I was sure it was going to be Namwoon Kim. I'm just surprised he's so friendly.
113,"Jul 13, 2022",Wow death seemed to really chill you out Kim Namwoon. Good for ya.
113,"Jul 13, 2022",HIS EMO HAIR IS CUTE AAAAAAHHHHHH
113,"Aug 19, 2022",As soon as they said Lunatic I immediately thought of Namwoon. It's a bit surprising to see him all chill and relaxed. I mean he has a point. They are dead now. Well something tells me he might react a bit more hostile if he finds out Dokja is only on a field trip to rescue his Eurydice. Died trying to rescue a girl? That's the problem with your generation. You think love is worth dying for 😂
113,"Aug 18, 2022",I love how he was supposed to be the story's first villain character but in the underworld he seems pretty chill
113,"Aug 18, 2022","The Constellation [The Sadistic Chicken Lord] is happy with the incarnation [Kim Namwoon] having a change of heart, 200 Coins have been sponsored"
113,"Aug 18, 2022","I was going to hate him if he returned, but it seems like he's ""okay""? I guess it is hell, so..."
113,"Aug 18, 2022",dokja is prime bullying material in every realm or dimension 😭😂😂
113,"Aug 18, 2022","The irony is strong in this chapter, back in full circle Dokja reunited with Namwoon and even after he killed him in the beginning of it, Namwoon is friendly enough to help him to avoid getting in trouble ...for now."
113,"Aug 17, 2022",i guess death really humbled Namwoon 😂
113,"Aug 17, 2022","i was so sad that kim namwoon died because he seemed like such an interesting character, so i'm really glad to see him again. like dokja, idk why i didn't analyze that the people he killed would be there. it's surprising how nice he's being towards dokja, but i assume that his time there is to blame for it. perhaps he's just glad that he's seeing someone he knows, or maybe he's smart enough to know that he should keep someone like dokja by his side. anyway i really hope he comes back w dokja "
113,"Aug 19, 2022",bros finally looking like a normal high schooler
113,"Aug 19, 2022",i was actually very excited to see namwoon kim again 
113,"Aug 18, 2022",he's actually pretty easy to get along with when they aren't playing death games on interdimensional reality TV
113,"Aug 18, 2022",Death seems to have mellowed the edgelord down a bit. Good for him
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Ngl namwoon’s got me kicking my feet and twirling my hair oml 
113,"Aug 17, 2022","i will consume kim namwoon, he's so friendly with dokja, who literally killed him; i just wish this turn's namwoon showed up more throughout on in the story"
113,"Jul 15, 2022","[The constellation ""The Red King"" is  anticipating the arrival of cerberus. 1500 coins have been sponsored.]"
113,"Aug 20, 2022",AYO WHERE IS MY MAN [CONSTELLATION LAZY BROKE WEEB] AT??? No but seriously i miss you [CONSTELLATION LAZY BROKE WEEB] come back to us please we need you ;-;
113,"Aug 19, 2022",>:0 new frenemies relationship……?
113,"Aug 18, 2022","Ok I’m a certified simp for Dokja, arrest me. (And now that I’ve reached the latest chapters it’s time to go back and reread from the start ❤️)"
113,"Aug 18, 2022",Doggy! :D
113,"Aug 18, 2022",Never thought I’d see him again
113,"Aug 18, 2022","Well, he made a new friend today that was an enemy.  Frenemy. "
113,"Aug 18, 2022","namwon Kim is better in this world, he's more bright, unlike before like he's ready to kill everyone 😂😂"
113,"Aug 18, 2022","huh, I'd have though a giant warmech would be more up Hephaestus' alley. Also, I find it hilarious Dokja bypasses Acheron and Hades and just gets dropped straight into Tartarus! like, who'd you piss off to just bypass the bureaucracy of the Greek underworld like that!"
113,"Aug 17, 2022",isn't the panel with shin yuseung changed? i remember sth entirely different 
113,"Aug 17, 2022",i want those sandals so bad
113,"Aug 17, 2022",NOVEL READERS HOW ARE WE DOING RN HOW ARE WE DOINGGG!! Namwoon I have missed you my son 
113,"Aug 17, 2022",NAMWOON IS SO FINE HELLO??????
113,"Aug 17, 2022","Sorry but I loved Namwoon from when he was first introduced, he just seemed interesting to me— but now I feel like we missed a couple character arcs of him in hell 🤣🤣"
113,"Aug 17, 2022","When a great character dies but the readers want him back.😘😘Author be like: *sigh* fine, fine you lunatics!🤣🤣"
113,"Aug 17, 2022",the fact that he did die saving someone during that scenario but it wasn't a girl 🫢😂
113,"Aug 17, 2022",still kinda hard to believe he actually likes hell
113,"Aug 17, 2022",IT'S THAT A NEW PANEL I SEE  👀 SHIN YOSUNG 💓💓💓💓
113,"Jul 14, 2022",[impatient binge reader catches up in 12 hours and is biting their nails in waiting] ---- [25 coins have been gifted]
113,"Jul 13, 2022",ALL DOGGOS ARE PUPPY REGARDLESS OF SIZE OF AGE. I WISH TO PET THE FORBIDDEN PUPPY. 
113,"Aug 18, 2022","""Go there and pretend your hammering something"" new kid school vibes"
113,"Aug 21, 2022",Day 112 of voicing all the characters
113,"Aug 20, 2022","Namwoon Kim seems a bit different.. Then again, Dokja should be major levels above him now. And Namwoon actually seems to be respecting the rules and going along with things, wow, that's a first. But we'll see. We'll see if he's really changed or if this is just another of his tricks."
113,"Aug 18, 2022",damn hope this means Kim namwoon is coming back.
113,"Aug 18, 2022",ngl i wish kim namwoon to be revived and be back at the story lol
113,"Aug 18, 2022",Dokja: nothing like a casual stroll through hell to wake me up in mornings 🌄 
113,"Aug 18, 2022","this makes sense, his character was interessing and don t use him will be just a waste"
113,"Aug 18, 2022","I became a fan of Kim Dokja from the first chapter, but been slowly becoming the fan of the commenter 'Marry me. Kim Dokja' nowadays"
113,"Aug 18, 2022",is it just me or is Kim dokja's eyelashes got longer?
113,"Aug 18, 2022",“Did you really forget?” Me: I’M TRYING TO SEE YOUR GOSH DANG FACE BECAUSE I FORGOT WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE BUT THE SCHOOL WI-FI WON’T LET PAST SHIT!
113,"Aug 17, 2022",OUTFIT CHANGE!!!! Dokja is slaying in those robes. It’s kind of funny that Dokja goes to hell. Literally… Maybe it’s just me- But we get to see Kim Namwoon again!!! I’m excited to see how he’ll somehow become one of Dokja’s troupe (I know he will. I feel it in my s o u l). 
113,"Aug 17, 2022",tbh i wouldve enjoy staying there too lol. i only need to work hard and not worrying abt killing people or fighting for my life (all those hellish scenarios). also... there's him 😗👉🏼👈🏼
113,"Aug 17, 2022",ily this webtoon! 😆🤌
113,"Aug 17, 2022",damn he cute and nicer now
113,"Aug 17, 2022","it is interesting that he is talking about Acheron while in my country when we talk about greek mythology we talk about Styx, they are both right as Hades has 5 rivers, just an interesting thing to me"
113,"Aug 17, 2022",he seems pretty chill after literally getting his head blown off over a cricket.
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Are they building an eva?? 
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Feels weird to say Kim Namwoon looks cute but it's the truth
113,"Aug 17, 2022",nice outfit dokja 
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Maybe you could convince Persephone that your family didn’t give you the prober funeral rites and you need three days to haunt them! With your book abilities maybe you can influence them to your narrative!
113,"Aug 16, 2022",The hell's voldemort doing there
113,"Jul 15, 2022","oh no I've reached this point so soon !! 😱😫😵 enjoyed everything so far so much !! thanks so much author !! and thankyou so much everyone !! #AwesomeCommunity (I hope our favorite constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" is doing okay !!?)"

113,"Jul 14, 2022",Namwoom makes his return. And Dokja realizes this won't be easy.
113,"Jul 13, 2022","[Constellation, Horn of the Ram, is curious how this newfound companionship will pan out.]"
113,"Sep 2, 2022",as soon as the underworld appeared I was hoping this dude would come back!!! aaaaaa!!! this story is so satisfying at every turn! (and the ways it's presented & the art are so good too 😭 wouldn't be the same without these visuals)
113,"Aug 24, 2022",How can the characters not think Dokja's handsome?! 😭
113,"Aug 24, 2022",dokja: you’re laughing. i’m stuck in hell and you’re laughing
113,"Aug 23, 2022",LMAO I LOVE THIS NAMWOON
113,"Aug 22, 2022",i like kim namwoon now actually

113,"Aug 22, 2022",Robot looks like an Eva 
113,"Aug 22, 2022",the expressions this chapter were hilarious 
113,"Aug 22, 2022",Oh baby we are on the Underworld 😭😭😭 haha I find kinda funny the fact that dokja dislikes so much Namwoon but I won't talk about it bc spoiler but 😭
113,"Aug 22, 2022","lol it's funny how Dokja hates him with such passion, his face screams why did I meet him here it could've been someone else"
113,"Aug 22, 2022","I love how Namwoon is now just like ""Hey pal, fancy seeing you here😃"""
113,"Aug 20, 2022","love how chill he is. ""welcome to the underworld dokja, who killed me. oh look, at that, that's the robot i'm building. come help."" lmaooo"
113,"Aug 20, 2022",I love how dokja killed namwoon and namwoon being buddy-buddy with him like they're friends and there's nothing going on between them 😃😃
113,"Aug 20, 2022",NOT YALL TRUSTING HIM IMMEDIATELY or maybe I just have trust issues lol dokja gets betrayed too much
113,"Aug 19, 2022",Hoho kim namwoo glad to see KDJ 🫣🤭🤣 he acts like a teenage boy in his age.
113,"Aug 19, 2022",Happy 2 years anniversary!!! 
113,"Aug 19, 2022",Namwoon Kim looks like evil Gojo Satoru
113,"Aug 18, 2022",He got sent to afterlife boot camp XD
113,"Aug 18, 2022",i forgot how kim namwoon died.... 
113,"Aug 18, 2022","The irony that Namwoon is guiding Dokja in the underworld like Virgil guided Dante in hell is going to be quite a 12 hour Odyssey. Hmm, than that also makes Beast Lord girl the Beatrice in this story."
113,"Aug 18, 2022","I just wanna see Hades and Persephone, as much as I know they probably won't appear uwu"
113,"Aug 18, 2022",Namwoon w the longer hair kinda🥵🥵
113,"Aug 18, 2022",I SIMPathize with dokja for real 
113,"Aug 18, 2022",Namwoon is too twisted to ever be trusted but it's nice to see him being helpful
113,"Aug 18, 2022",comments on this webtoon never fail to make me laugh I swear 😂😂
113,"Aug 17, 2022",The way Kim Namwoon wasn't even mad lmaoo
113,"Aug 17, 2022",One of the things I love about this WEBTOON is that the ideas and adventures always feel fresh. Such a great idea to use multiple legends instead of just one that turns stale. The title is freaking amazing as well. 
113,"Aug 17, 2022",kdj's eyelashes are so pretty wtf and his hairrr is so floofyyy
113,"Aug 17, 2022","Kim Namwoon joined the chat! I've read so many fanfics with him alive that I forgot he's dead lmao. Well, at least he's happy here, that's all that matters <3"
113,"Aug 17, 2022",ngl death did him right
113,"Aug 17, 2022",If Dokja killed Namwoon he wouldn’t be able to access the abilities of the king of undying right? Cause doesn’t he have to not kill anyone in order to achieve that?
113,"Aug 17, 2022",I like him now.. why did you had to kill him Ugly Squid? (ಥ﹏ಥ)
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Wowoah I thought he would hit Kdj :'))
113,"Aug 17, 2022","I love him. One, he's a villain. I adore villains. Two, he's cheery yet threatening. And three, he did that fun thing where you lean down to look up at someone while smirking. Hope he's around a lot this arc! "
113,"Aug 17, 2022","He’s actually nicer now that he’s dead, damn"
113,"Aug 17, 2022","I have been trying to draw something like those overseers for a while now. So glad I have a refrence picture(for a guide, not to steal the art/concept)."
113,"Aug 17, 2022","Wait... there's always a price whenever someone comes back from the dead. What if Namwoon Kim is the price here? If you want to bring back an angel, you must also restore a demon?"
113,"Aug 17, 2022",AW SHI-
113,"Aug 17, 2022",I forgot about this guy and I thought he was cute… anything wrong with me? 😂🫣
113,"Aug 17, 2022",IDK WHY BUT NAMWOON IS LITERALLY SO CUTE - like not from appearance (well also that) but the way he is acting
113,"Aug 17, 2022",I still wanna know what the author of WEBTOON in-story gave him cause as I recall when Dokja was still on the train the author sent him a starter package kinda to his house which he hasn’t been to so that’s one thing that interest me the other one is I HAVE A THEORY SO y’all now how at the beginning of the series dokja finished reading the story but here’s where it gets crazy RIGHT after he gets done reading the story it’s becomes true and all this stuff starts happening so that made me think
113,"Aug 17, 2022","namwoon seems to just be chill now, thought he'd be an antagonist"
113,"Aug 17, 2022","This story is next level, every chapter blows my mind"
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Ngl I dig this namwoon Kim 
113,"Aug 17, 2022",DAMMM NAMWOON’S BACK??? Mm and ngl i envy his looks like bro’s hair look *chef’s kiss*
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Namwoon?? HE LOOKS SOO HOT OH MY GOD
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Kim Namwoon is...calmer than before

113,"Jul 14, 2022","Dokja:Hades.....Underworld.....Me: HUH I wonder if Kim from the subway would be here.
Kim:Oh hello there friend.
Me: SPEAK  OF THE FUCKING DEVIL!"
113,"Jul 14, 2022","Wuuttt? We missed this cool Namwoon? 😭 
but anw can’t forget how he act at the first scenario 👁👄👁 "
113,"Jul 13, 2022",the realm of constellations is also a very interesting phrase.
113,"Jul 13, 2022",hm wait it's only been a couple of days in the underworld which implies time moves much slower there. which means some time could pass in the real world I could also be wrong due to how Namwoon Kim's hair grew a bit since the last he saw dokja.
113,"Jul 13, 2022","I tell you, the face I made when I saw that white hair... 😮"
113,"Aug 18, 2022",why does Dokja as a man have a small waist? For me to grab it?? The duality of men

113,"Aug 18, 2022","You know... I would expect Kim Namwoon to be mad at the person who killed him, but... I guess making him a friend isn't so bad XD"
113,"Aug 18, 2022","He doesn't even care about what happened with them in the past anymore, he's just happy he finally has a friend in hell! XD GUNDAM BOY BEST BOY "

113,"Aug 17, 2022",This chapter was cute and adorable for so many reasons. I can't 😂
113,"Aug 17, 2022",as soon as I saw the White hairs I knew it was THE Lunatic xD
113,"Aug 17, 2022",HE DIDN'T CALL HIM GRASSHOPPER AHJUSSI IM SO SAD
113,"Aug 17, 2022",My greek myth nerd self is THRIVING rn you have no idea how happy i am with this new arc hehehee
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Get in the robot Dokja
113,"Aug 17, 2022","Kim Namwoon seem like a normal person here, but there are still little elements of his crazy in the way he acts. I mean i wouldn't have expected him to help Dokja like at all 😂. But it's apparent that he's happy dokja didn't end up a hero after all and he's in the same shit as him."
113,"Aug 17, 2022","This is kind of unexpected out of all the people, the one helping Dokja is Kim Namwoon.I mean they literally tried to kill each other in the first scenario"
113,"Aug 17, 2022",kim namwoon is so pretty wtf
113,"Aug 17, 2022","Always expected Namwoon Kim to return, for a dead character he gets name-checked WAY too often to remind us who he was. Loving to see where this goes."
113,"Aug 17, 2022",this is such an interesting twist! I was thinking the story was getting a little stagnant but I'm very interested now!
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Bro I always had a feeling he’d somehow come back into the story
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Whatever happened to this psycho who’s acting all nice. Is it a vengeance trap? There must be a reason the other guys fear him…
113,"Aug 17, 2022",is there a way we can see dokja's arse
113,"Aug 17, 2022","I don't know if I should be happy to see Namwoon again because maybe this time I can legally like him, but I have trust issue so really I'm scared 😅"
113,"Aug 17, 2022",dokja was like “you laughing girl? you think this is funny”
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Hell really changed him 
113,"Aug 17, 2022",KIM NAMWOON IS BACKK I'VE WAITED FOR SO LONG
113,"Aug 17, 2022","Okay, the Titan Soldier admittedly looks awesome."
113,"Aug 17, 2022",why help suddenly or has he got an ult motive?
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Can someone remind me who Namwoon Kim is??🥲
113,"Aug 17, 2022",dam hes actually helping 
113,"Aug 17, 2022",My ship is about to bloom 🛳
113,"Aug 17, 2022",unexpectedly he's helping him to hide lol 🌚
113,"Aug 17, 2022",He’s oddly nice to the dude who killed him
113,"Aug 17, 2022","THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN SEEING ON TIKTOK, NOW TO WAIT FOR 117"
113,"Aug 17, 2022",I’m going INSANE!! Look at how Dokja is dressed!!! Thank you Underworld!! (Why he still look good with a potato sack on though??)
113,"Aug 17, 2022","I skip reading orv for a few weeks only to come back to Dokja being dead, why am I not surprised"
113,"Aug 17, 2022","sleeveless kdj, long haired knw, pretty sys in that one panel... i think i'm gonna pass out /(T-T)\"
113,"Aug 17, 2022","that orpheus reference from dionisyus back there gives me some Bad vibes.. butits an OPMC manwha, hell be fine"
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Well that was quick 👁️👄👁️I had barely enough braincells before I processed what happened😭
113,"Aug 17, 2022",I had a feeling we'd be seeing Namwoon Kim again! 😄
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Wonder if he'll sabotage the robot ro make the future main scenario easier.
113,"Aug 17, 2022","I was wondering if was ever gonna return to the story even though he died, but I should've expected something like this."
113,"Aug 17, 2022",NAMWOON KIM ❤️❤️
113,"Aug 17, 2022","I don’t remember him, what chapter was he last seen in?"
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Damn The Delusional Demon being nice to the guy who killed himkinda weird but I like this dynamic sort of

113,"Aug 17, 2022","""Namwoon Kim?!"" 😶😶😶 freaking- never thought we'd see that guy again"

113,"Aug 13, 2022",KIM NAMWOON?!?!?
113,"Aug 13, 2022",He's really a lunatic considering how he's laughing at that situation🙁
113,"Aug 13, 2022",Well.. this is my 1st time actually working hard to collect free coins and spend them 
113,"Aug 12, 2022",When Namwoon is nicer in hell than in Earth lol
113,"Aug 12, 2022",Kim Namwoon treating dokja nicely is soo unexpected. but definitely loving it! 
113,"Aug 12, 2022",I KNEW I LIKED THAT KID FROM THE BEGINNING I'M SO GLAD HE'S BACK 😭
113,"Aug 12, 2022",bro he seems so kind

113,"Aug 11, 2022",Those overseeres had the *BeST* posture
113,"Aug 11, 2022",Did The Delusional Demon not realize Dokja killed him?
113,"Aug 11, 2022","she's so beautiful, please i can't move on😭"
113,"Aug 10, 2022",nawoons comeback>>> who knows maybe he'll be a bit less psycho this time 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
113,"Aug 10, 2022",Dokja's reaction when Namwoon thought he died trying to save a girl LMAOO
113,"Aug 10, 2022",Sobbing because i dont have anymore coins 😔 
113,"Aug 3, 2022",Dokja just keeps dying like he's one of the Winchester brothers

113,"Jul 23, 2022","Goddamit, don't tell me I'm going to start liking Kim Namwoon now...sigh..『The Non-Constellation, A Sleepless Reader, is satisfied with the growth of Kim Dokja's harem.』 5 coins have been sponsored."
113,"Jul 23, 2022",dokja: you're laughing? i'm in hell and you're laughing?
113,"Jul 13, 2022",Dokja just please don't kill him again lol

113,"Sep 16, 2022",I was todays years old when I realized that prisoner of the golden headband is probably the monkey king from journey to the west and no spoiler because I bet all of Asia did know it immediately

113,"Aug 25, 2022",wait he's kinda nice. I feel bad now ☹️
113,"Aug 25, 2022",yaaaay Cerberus puppy 😄🤩
113,"Aug 25, 2022","I was NOT expecting his comeback. I did think it was a shame such a big character in the original story went out right away. So cool to see him again, but I’m nervous"
113,"Aug 24, 2022",ONG  NAMWOO KIM
113,"Aug 24, 2022",cnaI just be honest and admit Namwoon seems so a lil bit more innocent here like he is even helping the guy who indirectly killed him–

113,"Aug 21, 2022",I didn't expect Kim Namwoon to be nice to him but I didn't want to see him throw hands and get Dokja in trouble so I'm not complaining 
113,"Aug 21, 2022",KIM NAMWOON TURNED HOTT YESSS
113,"Aug 21, 2022",I guess death let him relax more. But he's still an edgelord. 
113,"Aug 21, 2022",It's been three days since I read this. Now I'm sad that I have to wait.
113,"Aug 21, 2022",WAIT WE'RE OVER 1000 *FLAILS ARMS ABOUT* HAPPY POET'S DAY!

113,"Aug 18, 2022","Why are they in Tartarus? Human souls don’t go to Tartarus. Even if they’re really really bad, they go to the fields of punishment. Not Tartarus. "
113,"Aug 18, 2022",why is he so friendly now
113,"Aug 18, 2022",Dokja probably gonna some how make the dude an ally.
113,"Aug 18, 2022",i have a bad memory so some of the characters i really have to recall and its been months since i read the chapter 100😭 i had to go back from the early chapters to remember huiwon
113,"Aug 18, 2022",I didn't expect namwoon to be so kind to someone who killed him but I like when he's smiling. seems like I got another crush 
113,"Aug 18, 2022",Why is it called the titian soldier and not the god fighter? that sounded way better in my opinion.
113,"Aug 18, 2022",Namwoon looks very cheerful rather than at the beginning loll but like.... dokja tho ;) iahajjanqavajacaba ehehhehehehe 
113,"Aug 18, 2022",nuuuuu it's over I finally caught up AMAZING BEUTIFUL SERIES<3 AND TAKE YOUR TIME this art looks really hard to rush
113,"Aug 18, 2022",GUNDAM BEST BOYYY!!!

113,"Aug 17, 2022",Lol it'd be a weird family but Dokja havin one version of Yuseung as an adopted daughter an one as a gf seems okay in this strange world.
113,"Aug 17, 2022",cant remember him ugh my memory sucks
113,"Aug 17, 2022","i see he made amends, good for him"
113,"Aug 17, 2022","I thought namwoon will fight him or something, but it turned out he’s a nice kid ( in the underworld)"

113,"Aug 17, 2022",thanks for the amazing episode authors and translator-nim 💖
113,"Aug 17, 2022","I didn't expected Namwon to be so nice with Dokja, although he still has weird expressions"
113,"Aug 17, 2022","Okay Kim Namwoon is acting pretty sus, I don't trust him"
113,"Aug 17, 2022","Good to see (new and improved) Kim Namwoon again 👀. And he's sort of right, Dokja did die to save her I guess."
113,"Aug 17, 2022","ah the overseers , secret's about to be out now i wanna see knw's face when he realises he's the only dead subway guy here"
113,"Aug 17, 2022",die trying to save a girl - true in a sense 😆

113,"Aug 17, 2022","I was so sad he died at the start, who knew he'd come back! ... well I guess the people who've read ahead but still-"
113,"Aug 17, 2022","*clears throat* Midway upon the journey of our lifeI found myself within a forest dark,
For the straightforward pathway had been lost."
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Why do I feel like Kim Namwoon is gonna be revived too?
113,"Aug 17, 2022",idk how dokja hated namwoon while reading twsa he is so cute 😭
113,"Aug 17, 2022",BRUH HOW DID NAMWOON BECOME THIS ADORABLE😭⁉️⁉️
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Noooo I want to continue reading why would you end the scenario now
113,"Aug 17, 2022",when they say Dionysus all that comes to my mind is potbellied dude in Hawaiian clothes Mr D. from percy jackson... am I the only one?? 🤔
113,"Aug 17, 2022","if only junghyeok was here, he would be raging seeing them together "
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Kim Dokja looks so quiznaking done i'm rofl 😂😂😂 it's what he deserves ♡
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Knew it wasnt the last time we'd get to see the guy
113,"Aug 17, 2022",It’s nice to kill someone Just to help you & aid you in hell 🤗
113,"Aug 17, 2022",ths last panel looks like they're in some rom com drama😂😂
113,"Aug 17, 2022",what happened to that boi?? did he used some of his screws to that robot or something??
113,"Aug 17, 2022",My boy's acting so nice
113,"Aug 17, 2022",you got to work extra hard here if you're new. love that.
113,"Aug 17, 2022",I was expecting him to be mad. Why's he so chill now?
113,"Aug 17, 2022",When your enemies become your allies Lol
113,"Aug 17, 2022",are they demators ??? Harry Potter???
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Seems like this wild beast (kim namwoon) will come to the realm world with dokja. i would love it if he joins the crew.... But he was not in the panel in the 1st chp
113,"Aug 17, 2022",namwoon to dokja: lol u ded 2? cmon now let's build legos
113,"Aug 17, 2022",maybe my eyes are playing tricks but kim Namwoon looks ducking hot🔥
113,"Aug 17, 2022","Namwoon!!!! I missed him!!! he seems nice and friendly now, it is kind of weird to see him in that way, but is is so cute, i like this somewhat new Namwoon!! he is too cute!!🤗💜☺️"
113,"Aug 17, 2022","I wonder if he's being nicer because of Dokja's understanding while Namwoon was under his bookmarks. I know he no longer is, but who is to say that the understanding dissipates when that does?"
113,"Aug 17, 2022",I still don't trust him. It's eerie. I hope Dokja doesn't let his guard down. 
113,"Aug 17, 2022","Hey there, crazy ep4-ep6 character whose name I have forgotten! 😃 Overseers?  I thought they were Dementors... Not flowy enough... "
113,"Aug 17, 2022",HES HERE!!! BEST BOY IS HERE!!!!
113,"Aug 17, 2022",LOL wow
113,"Aug 17, 2022",MY CUTE LITTLE SKRUNKLE KNW 😭😭
113,"Aug 17, 2022",nah but like.... why is he actually trying to help him??? I like that
113,"Aug 17, 2022",hades is on that grind
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Why do I feel like when he finds out he is alive he gonna go psycho mode again
113,"Aug 17, 2022","Wait wait wait, is Namwoon the Gundam boy that's everybody's talking about?"
113,"Aug 17, 2022","Ngl when I read about titan soldiers, I imagined them as ruin hunters 😂"
113,"Aug 17, 2022","Namwoon helping Dokja in death -- did not expect that. Makes sense that he showed up again tho, there's no way the protag's old teammate could become that irrelevant in this regression."
113,"Aug 17, 2022",ooo wow. I pictured the Robot and underworld differently in the novel (more red) but the mission for Yuseung is clearer here. really cool!!
113,"Aug 17, 2022","Interesting that he seems to have lost his lust for murder now that he’s dead, but he’a also still a total sadist"
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Honestly thought we'd seen the last of that guy.
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Yeeeeeeee Finally
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Does anyone else think those overseers look a lot like the dementors from Harry Potter's movies?

113,"Aug 17, 2022",You are special. You are loved.
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Can't wait to see Hades 🥺

113,"Aug 17, 2022","Kim Namwoon is…not terrible??? Idk I’m surprised pfft— but I like the new one better; I even agree with him on some things, like how people’s obsession with (romantic) love is kinda stupid and overboard lmao—though I do actually like romance a good bit usually, shit like Romeo and Juliet just pisses me off. Anyway, I’m glad he’s helping Dokja navigate this place haha"
113,"Aug 17, 2022",Shit… its too short😔Too damn short😭 All I’M ASKING FOR IS TO READ THIS COMIC FOR AT LEAST TWO ETERNITIES 😭😭😭😭😭😭

113,"Jul 13, 2022","Something he's not considering is that he's raised his stats significantly since last he saw Kim Namwoon, Kim should be a pushover in comparison."
113,"Jul 13, 2022","Strangely, I didn't expect to see Namwoon back either. It still seems like a great thing"
113,"Jul 13, 2022",Omg I’m glad we get to see more of Namwoon XD

113,2 days ago,"Wow.We have came a long way, from the subway to Hell.
Wow.
Just Wow."
113,2 days ago,It's been a good read so far.  Glad I was willing to get past the first several chapters which should have been abridged as a prologue so as not to lose readers especially since the meat of the story begins after those 1st set of chapters where he keeps referring to the text without doing anything as if he were a bystander.  The pace really picked up after that. 5 stars!
113,2 days ago,""" he must be no body since I haven't heard of him 🤣🤣🤣that sassy side of his"
113,3 days ago,HELP WHY IS KIM NAMWOON SO NICE LOL

113,4 days ago,"this is hella accurate. wait, wa'bout the judges? shouldnt he go through them first? well, it would make sense, since dionysus will likely be in heaps of trouble if he is caught helping smuggle a living into the underworld"

113,"Oct 6, 2022",imagine he's like screw it and saces them both from the afterlife 😂
113,"Oct 6, 2022","The rivers are… Styx(hatred) gives invulnerability to those that bathe in it and survive, Charon guides souls across, people swear upon it. Lethe(oblivion) you lose your memory if you bathe in it. Acheron(woe or misery) admittedly does occasionally replace the river styx. Phlegethon(river of fire) flows into tarturous, keeps souls and even living beings alive in the underworld, very painful to drink.
Cocytus(wailing) for the souls Charon does not ferry over."
113,"Sep 30, 2022","is it weird that I'm glad to see him- it's like the feeling of meeting an old elementary school classmate who was a psycho like ""hey i know your face"""

113,"Sep 7, 2022","That Hades mf get people's souls to work on an Eva, bruh"
113,"Sep 7, 2022","KNW is one of those characters that could’ve had their lives severely changed had TWSA not happened, personality wise. He died when he was 17. Tbf, even though he’s edgy and got a pleasure in killing, that was only because of the quick changes. It even mentions before that KDJ felt guilty because KNW probably would have gone off to college had ORV not happened. I think the apocalypse is what brought about this wicked change in KNW. We all know he was just a chuuni before but these circumstances "
113,"Sep 7, 2022","for someone who failed his entrance exams, kdj is incredibly well versed in a lot of things"

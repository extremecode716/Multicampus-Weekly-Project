Episode,Date,Review
44,"Mar 3, 2021",Don't you just hate it when you lose control of your newest killing machine because his boyfriend starts yelling about how he isn't alone?
44,"Mar 3, 2021",This is a Gilyeong appreciation comment
44,"Mar 3, 2021",dokjas like i’m hitting this man because this might be my only opportunity 
44,"Mar 3, 2021",Cinema master seemed to know who Dokja was based on his power. I wonder if there is an Omniscient Reader in every story?
44,"Mar 3, 2021","Aww little moments like Dokja supporting Gilyoung while he's unconscious (hugs, head pats, etc.) are so cute. I love me some found family moments. Kinda laughed at how the team was admiring the shooting stars & left Joonghyuk on the ground like ""Here, watch our weapons for a bit"" 😅"
44,"Mar 3, 2021",“It’s so unfair fighting the main character” I know right I feel so bad for jungkeok
44,"Mar 3, 2021","Everyone else ""Finally its over"" Dokja ""Oh but its only just begun"""
44,"Mar 3, 2021","[The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" was satisfied with the outcome and is wondering about where the cinema master go.] [The constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" is praising the incarnation kdj for its showcase of a new stigma.] [5 coins have been sponsored. ]"
44,"Mar 3, 2021",just in case someone didn't catch it.... dokja's blade didn't touch the theater master. He just vanished into dust before the blade got to him. That's why dokja was confused.
44,"Mar 3, 2021","I believe the author of TWSA may be an admin or an ultimate Constelation and Dokja, the only person to ever finish his novel, is his incarnation free of contract out of appreciation for being the only one in creation that finished His novel."
44,"Mar 3, 2021","Can we talk about how stunning the art for this series is? The rendition of the 4th Wall was BRILLIANT,  & the panel with the shooting stars was so beautiful it made me wish on them for more free coins from webtoon coz I've run out of them to fast pass upcoming chapters :""]"
44,"Mar 4, 2021",i like how the praying mantis was just like GG at the end and headed out
44,"Mar 3, 2021",Junghyeok lost cus he doesn't has the power of friendship
44,"Mar 3, 2021",DOKJA YOU DID NOT JUST SEAL YOUR DEATH WITH THAT WISH DID YOU? OH GOD I HOPE NOT
44,"Mar 3, 2021",at that moment. the cinima master realized he too was but a character in someone elses story and was doomed to fail.
44,"Mar 3, 2021",“Could you be...?” WHAT!?? What did cinema master know!?? oh my god I’m so thrilled to see where this story goes
44,"Mar 3, 2021",And now we're finally past the prologue part of the story. Buckle in the next arc is going to be wild!
44,"Mar 3, 2021",oh look the city’s destroyed and a bunch of people are dead but hey look the sky’s pretty
44,"Mar 3, 2021",Only 1000 coins for clearing? Cheapskates
44,"Mar 3, 2021",Damn the 4th wall is too OP .. It block a constellation mind control right and more of that destroy it? 😳
44,"Mar 3, 2021",I just want to take a moment to applaud the illustrators. The art for sword song is absolutely God tier. They are killing it in adapting this Webnovel.
44,"Mar 3, 2021",AYO CINEMA MASTER COME BACK HERE AND TELL US WHO DOKJA REALLY IS
44,"Mar 3, 2021",[Achievement unlocked! Completing the Tutorial!] [5 coins has been awarded!]
44,"Mar 3, 2021",Dokja doesnt realize how OP he is gonna become.
44,"Mar 3, 2021",I love the first glimpse at the fourth wall
44,"Mar 3, 2021","So the cinema master knows what Dokja is? His smile as he died, so knowing. "
44,"Mar 3, 2021",this episode... chef kisses
44,"Mar 3, 2021",Oh hey we're all caught up with those prologue images aren't we? I always thought that city scene was beautiful.
44,"Mar 3, 2021","It’s nice to see moments I loved reading in the novel, being brought into art form."
44,"Mar 3, 2021","God damn. It really sucks we have to wait a whole week for these chapters. even on fast pass it's not enough. This novel has been unfathomable Good, and to think we are only in the beginning. So it quite literally breaks my heart to wait a week for one chapter. I don't think I'm speaking for myself when I say "" I WOULD PAY MORE MONEY, FOR MORE CHAPTERS."" I'm not even joking. Omniscient Reader: is the only reason I give a shit about Wednesday. "
44,"Mar 3, 2021",i find it so funny that the most powerful guy is just lying on the ground looking ded
44,"Apr 7, 2021","""They say it won't come true if you tell what you wished for""""I wished to see this story's epilogue""
.... FUUUUUUUCK. "
44,"Apr 18, 2021",i love dokja’s and joonghyuk dynamic so much like that fight scene would look so cool animated
44,"Mar 3, 2021",Gilyoung is so precious I love how his attached to dokja and I love dokja for taking care of him anyway get ready guys the real thing happens now hahaha 
44,"Mar 3, 2021","It's supposed to be Recovery Lv. 2, not Resuscitation... He's not dead, if he had died he would have regressed..."
44,"Apr 21, 2021","Gilyeong is the weirdest, cutest comedy relief/badass character I’ve ever seen. I don’t know why I laughed so hard when Dokja said “you’re up?” After Gilyeong passed out summoning a titan beast. And Gilyeong just rolling with it is so funny "
44,"Apr 21, 2021","Gilyoung call Dokja ""hyung"" so please please please translate it as ""brother"" it's really so much better because Gilyoung and his releationship's the best 🥺🥺🥺🥺"
44,"Apr 21, 2021","""could you be-"" Me: Sir you come back right now and finish that sentence 😠"
44,"Apr 21, 2021","its not ""resuscitation"" but recovery lv. 2This needs to be fixed cause it causes confusion. When YJH dies he regresses, he dosent go through resuscitation. Translator needs to fix this. Please comment and point out this mistake so translator sees."
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Is nobody gonna talk about the weird ass ad at the end
44,"Apr 27, 2021",[TheQueitOne constellations chuckles at the players who only started reading Omniscient Reader for the event but got addicted instead😏]
44,"Apr 21, 2021","...
so that was a foreshadow.

""What I wish is to see the epilougue of a certain novel.""

bye I have ptsd"
44,"Jul 18, 2021",Junghyeok: “I am alone 😔” Dokja: “NO! 😠NO! 😡SHUT THE F*CK UP🤬! I WILL HIT YOU😤!”
44,"Apr 24, 2021",⚠️Again I REPEAT: For first time readers of ORV. ⚠️The comment section has many SPOILERS. So enter with caution! ⚠️ To my fellow novel readers. PLEASE I know its hard but lets not SPOIL other people and ruin their day. 😊✌️
44,"Sep 22, 2021",when you ship dokja kim and junghyeok yu 🤚😭 sorry y'all but now i can't stop imagining the two of them
44,"Mar 3, 2021","the mantis be like...""the job is done,,i'm out.""😆😆"
44,"Apr 27, 2021",I came here for the coin but end up reading everything. Why is this so GOOD?! I hope some director will notice this webtoon and make it real movie or drama series
44,"Apr 21, 2021",I wonder what Secretive Plotter is thinking right now...
44,"Sep 17, 2021",I like how Dokja skips towards Junghyeok Yu and proceeds to B o n k him lmao
44,"Apr 22, 2021","""its so unfair fighting the protagonist"" said every boss, miniboss, and grunt enemy everywhere "
44,"Apr 21, 2021","✨I must say, the comments section is just as amazing as the episodes!✨ - people shipping dokja n junghyeok; admiring their family reunion after semi-apocalyptic war; enjoying the aftermath together; awaiting whatever is to come next; and all of it TOGETHER - both the characters and all of us readers here! {💜OR}"
44,"Apr 27, 2021","Woah, I read the entire comic up till now in one day. This is easily one of the most intriguing stories I've ever read. I've tried the video game based comics before but a lot of them just didn't quite stick. I'm SO glad I gave this one a chance. It's easily in my top 5 now."
44,"Apr 22, 2021",Are we really gonna ignore the fact that the panel where he looks at the city with the shooting stars was in the prologue?? 🥖
44,"Apr 22, 2021",This is where the free section of the original story ended and started costing. This is gonna be good
44,"Apr 21, 2021",the interaction between fourth wall and the boss is more tense in the novel.
44,"Jul 19, 2021",*KDJ seeing possessed JHK’s very punchable face* Kim Dokja: “It’s free real estate”
44,"Apr 27, 2021","Came for the coins, stayed for the badass characters and awesome story. :D"
44,"Mar 4, 2021","[A constellation ✨😇✨ is impressed by the camaraderie of Kim Dokja and Junghyeok Yu, 5 coins have been sponsored]"
44,"Oct 30, 2021",Dokja: This isn't you Junghyeok 🥺
44,"Jun 8, 2021",Holy shit the art in that star panel was eye candy
44,"Apr 21, 2021","i love this series but also i wish they translated the way that gilyeong calls dokja to “hyung” instead of just his name. it definitely gives a sense of how closely gilyeong feels to dokja and how attached he is, but this way makes it feel kind of weird to see such a small kid call an older man by his first name lol"
44,"Apr 21, 2021","i feel like what he was mentioning about how this ""might be the only time he could beat him"" is an omen that they'll have to fight again in the future, like maybe dojka has become the new protagonist. when he broke the 4th wall and that puppeteer was like "" could you be?"" was probably a reference to the importance he has a character. dokja's def underestimating the fact that he's one of (if not the) most powerful players already, and that his 4th wall / omniscent reader skills are wild"
44,"Apr 21, 2021",dokja flexing his money in the advertisement too lmao 😂
44,"Apr 30, 2021",Anyone else kinda starting to ship Junghyeok and Dokjas?
44,"Apr 27, 2021","Man, I caught up without realizing it... Anyway, TITANO!!! I THOUGHT WE LOST YOU FOREVER, BUDDY!!
Also, Gilyeong is amazing. He lost so much blood in that nosebleed, passed out, and woke up less than an hour later."
44,"Apr 23, 2021",Ooh. Visually the picture of the Fourth Wall a MAJOR hint at a lot of end content! Wonder if anyone will figure it out. And the Seoul dome is about to get a lot more interesting! 
44,"Apr 21, 2021",For real this is too epic. Someone needs to make this into an anime.
44,"Mar 3, 2021",Damn he got himself some damn plot armor.
44,"Mar 3, 2021",I absolutely love how Dokja has to use every resource at his disposal to get past these challenges.
44,"Mar 3, 2021","I didn't mean to cry when Dokja said he wished to see the epilogue, I didn't😀👍"
44,"Jul 28, 2021","I wonder if this webtoon series will have 3,150 episodes"
44,"Jul 19, 2021","At this point, Dokja is Gilyeong's dad."
44,"Jun 25, 2021",“i wished that i would survive to see the epilogue of a certain novel” gives me such a bad feeling…
44,"Apr 29, 2021","Man was aboutta spill some spoilers but 4th wall shut him up(like, literally. He was about to say something a few hundred chapters in from the novel)"
44,"Apr 27, 2021","you see, literally every single one of my friends is reading ORV or raving about it in some manner, and they had this mission to convince me to fall down the rabbit hole. my username — that I’ve had for years — very coincidentally seems like a reference to the series and they KNOW that I’m overly obsessed with dystopian fiction. long story short I finally caved today... it’s been 4 hours of staring at my phone unblinkingly. I literally do not know why I’ve done this to myself during exam season."
44,"Apr 24, 2021","Dude thats the quote of the century ""Its so unfair fighting against the protagonist"""
44,"Apr 23, 2021",can we all talk about how cute Gilyeong is with that hat and molner
44,"Apr 22, 2021",so basically the only thing the cinema master found in dokja's brain was his fav novel
44,"Apr 21, 2021",ok wOW ART APPRECIATION DAAAAMN sigh i cannot express how much i LOVE the sceneries in every long panel it's AMAZING
44,"Apr 21, 2021",cinema master might know who created TWSA
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Gilyeong really pulled through for everyone 
44,"Mar 3, 2021","Ok, but those big panels with the cinema master laughing and the city view are just awesome. The story is magnificent , but i wanna congratulate the artist , your skills are incredible!!!"
44,"Sep 19, 2021",i love how gilyeong looks like he almost dies but then like a few seconds later he looks totally fine. he's truly stRONK o(︶︿︶)o (prodigy??? 0-0)
44,"May 8, 2021",Did the Cinema Master knew who Kim Dokja really is?
44,"May 7, 2021","Is that a flag? He told them his wish, so there's a chance that it wouldn't be come true."
44,"May 7, 2021",The details in the art are so goddamn beautiful
44,"May 6, 2021",I sincerely hope that in the future that dokja and Jungkeok become friends and if he ever dies again he tries to become friends with dokja again
44,"Apr 28, 2021",Plot twist: the cinema master was the author of TWSA
44,"Apr 28, 2021",when you start a web comic and binge 40 odd episodes in 2 days 👀👀👀
44,"Apr 27, 2021",My boy Gilyeong really did summon a big ass insect! That's impressive 👏👏👏
44,"Apr 23, 2021",COVER PICTURE MOMENT
44,"Apr 23, 2021","""I wish to see the epilogue"" is a line I'm angry it took this long to hear"
44,"Apr 22, 2021",does that mean dokja won’t survive because he said his wish out loud?
44,"Nov 15, 2021","bro gilyeong is so fuckiing cuttte his famous words ""hehe titano"" like bro "
44,"Sep 15, 2021","when dokja killed the cinema master, was it just me, or was he blushing?"
44,"Sep 9, 2021",Le Omniscient Sunfish 
44,"Jul 29, 2021","""could you be...?"" COULD YOU BE WHAT?? COULD YOU BE WHAAT CINEMA MASTER TELL MEEEE WHAT WERE YOU GONNA SAY"
44,"Jun 20, 2021",hope this will all go to 3999 episodes and I will be the only reader 😁
44,"May 2, 2021",ngl kind of starting to ship dokja and junghyeok
44,"Apr 27, 2021",Just realized that this episode is in the beginning of the very first episode. 
44,"Apr 27, 2021",I don't think I can wait anymore... Novel here I come... 
44,"Apr 27, 2021",i love this series so much like it’s so good but the spoilers in the comments are so annoying like i understand you’ve read the story before or know the whole plot but can you let others enjoy it too 
44,"Apr 26, 2021",ngl but Dokja is my fav because of his whole damn attitude and his looks(im sorry lmao 🗿🙏)
44,"Apr 25, 2021",You guys should really read the webnovel (551 chapters) the story is an absolute masterpiece. In fact what you've seen in the webtoon so far is not even the tip of the iceberg. 
44,"Apr 23, 2021","Normally I’m not a big fan of action or dystopian stories, but this webtoon is just so good fjdjsksk"
44,"Apr 22, 2021",it did feel like a season ending tho
44,"Apr 22, 2021",Don’t ever let someone tell you that bugs aren’t cool
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Can’t wait for Junghyeok to wake up and be pissed about losing
44,"Mar 3, 2021",junghyoki is the main character who supposed to save everybody but now we have dokji coming in and being his white knight. I think it's hilarious because when the savior needs saving. 
44,"Jul 2, 2021","Oh my god Titano has been waiting this whole time to come back and help his boi huh, jesus. Is that why he was able to talk to the bug already? Madness. Also, it might be that Simulation might be the one that wrote the story cause he seemed to recognize all the text and uh maybe even realized that Kim Dokja is his most dedicated reader. Course, I'm probably wrong but that reaction was rather interesting. Plus, I do wonder what contest the author won because of Dokja and it becoming paid content."
44,"May 19, 2021","As a reader, i'm jealous of Dokja getting to meet his favorite character in a web novel. When can i, too? T^T "
44,"Apr 28, 2021","Why is nobody talking about how the Cinema Master went all blushy blushy and ""Ah!"" When he read into Dokjas mind lmao. I wonder if Dokja was secretly chosen to be THE protagonist? In their story? Or maybe something even bigger. I'm glad he was able to save everyone too. I feel like, we're definitely going to lose people along the way... but, I'm hoping this will be the group that saves the world by uniting TOGETHER."
44,"Apr 27, 2021","i'm shocked to see the amount of likes per ep. is decreasing, how can people stop giving likes or drop this amazing series??"
44,"Apr 27, 2021",My gut tells me that the kid plays a crucial role in making a happy ending come true to the story. I think that the reason why the “protagonist” always fails is because he never relied on anyone and thought of them as his equal. So at first it might just be his protagonist pride but then it became unfixable due to the power difference 
44,"Apr 25, 2021",its funny how Dokja always thinks he isnt the main character but he is in our book
44,"Apr 23, 2021","Gahhh this is so good I finished the whole thing in two days!!!! But I absolutely love the characters the art, and the amazing story line. I’m so glad I read this and I can’t wait for the new episodes to come out!!!"
44,"Apr 23, 2021","AHHHHHH I FINALLY CAUGHT UP!! I just wanna dump all of my appreciation for this webtoon into this one comment because this has become a new favorite!! I love all of the characters, their relationships with each other, the art style, story line, EVERYTHING. This is literally one of the best webtoons I've read in the way of intricacy and attention to detail on every little thing. Thank you for bringing such an amazing story onto this platform!❤"
44,"Apr 22, 2021",Having read the full story and epilogue I can say that I'm still blown away with each and every episode by the way that the artist has been able to bring this story to life to such a perfect extent!
44,"Apr 22, 2021",Another friendly reminder to first time readers of ORV. The comments section has many SPOILERS. So enter with caution 😅
44,"Apr 22, 2021",THE FOURTH WALL HAS BEEN SHOOKITH
44,"Apr 22, 2021","""Its so unfair fighting against the protagonist"" -The protagonist 2021-"
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Tokyo ghoul eyes?And that old guys ending should be illegal.He was def gonna say something important
44,"Apr 21, 2021",That ad at the bottom tho. The author never stops giving us reasons to laugh😭😂😂😂
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Is he a what⁉️⁉️⁉️ IS HE A WHAT⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️
44,"Mar 3, 2021",This feels like it would be the end of Season 1 if this gets made into an anime.
44,"Mar 3, 2021",Wait....IS THAT THE SAME PRAYING MANTIS WE SAW IN THE MOVIE?
44,"Mar 3, 2021",Can we all just appreciate how good this episode's art was in particular? Phenomenal 
44,"Oct 2, 2021","do you think if dokja donated to the webnovel he would have become a constellation, lol that would be pretty weird."
44,"Sep 8, 2021","i feel like the cinema master is either an avatar of TWSA's author or is some sort of subordinate of them. cuz he was like ""could you be..?"" and then smiled when he realised who dokja was. i don't think there's an omniscient reader in every regression tho, bcos junghyeok definitely wld hv connected the dots by now. mby all the author has several avatars/parts of their consciousness that blend into the story and we don't know who they are, but they'll start to subtly help dokja in the future"
44,"Jul 26, 2021",woah the art is seriously so cool
44,"Jul 17, 2021",could you be…..COULD YOU BE WHAT? 🤨
44,"Jul 12, 2021","Yu Junghyeok: ""Who are you?(spoiling my whole life..)"""
44,"Jun 13, 2021","hehe, titano"
44,"May 23, 2021",Gilyeong is the best of them all 
44,"May 14, 2021",cinema master looks happy when he got bonked by dokja. he looks sus
44,"May 14, 2021","My plan was to read one episode and pace myself BUT THIS FIGHT WAS SO AWESOME, I HAD TO SEE IT THROUGH!!!!😩😩😩😩😩"
44,"Apr 30, 2021","They didn’t clarify it in the webtoon, but in novel, this insect is the small one from the T-rex movie. However, this is also the insect king that the kid almost summoned in the earlier episodes. "
44,"Apr 29, 2021",I just realized but why was the cinema master blushing before he died??! lmaoo whatt 😂
44,"Apr 28, 2021","""it's unfair fighting against the protagonist"" = pretty much every antagonist / side character in a story "
44,"Apr 27, 2021",There goes my 10 hour reading of this manhwa... Guess I'll be sleeping in the morning again... can't wait for the next ones can't buy it I'm broke TT
44,"Apr 25, 2021",why is the popularity so much lower than before this webtoon should have all the hype and stuff in the world this is amazing 
44,"Apr 23, 2021",why did the cinema master blush when dokja was slashing his head?? lmfao
44,"Apr 23, 2021",does anyone else really want to know what the Cinema Master was going to say 🤔
44,"Apr 23, 2021",I'm glad the author got sponsored they deserve it xD
44,"Apr 23, 2021",my kid Gilyeong really outdid himself this time 🤧
44,"Apr 22, 2021",the art just takes me aback every damn time like everytime i read this novel the art just keeps getting better and better and better like how much better is there I'm simply in such great awe this artist is truly a really great one with such big potential please please keep going I'd love to see you thrive
44,"Apr 22, 2021",That ad tripped me out for a second
44,"Apr 22, 2021",I love gilyeong so damn much and he’s already matured so much. Like this dude needs so much appreciation and love
44,"Apr 22, 2021","Dokja forgets that he is the protagonist of the actual webtoon, and hence can end up being just as OP"
44,"Apr 22, 2021","gilyeong is the best, such a cool kid"
44,"Apr 21, 2021",i captured that panel when the cinema master blush when he realized who's dokja 😂
44,"Apr 21, 2021","Speaking of constellations.. I always thought that the 'Secretive Plotter' was like the author or at least like, someone who knows how this story goes and wants to see what Dokja does"
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Congrats to Omniscient Reader for the only webtoon with Kim Dokja in it!! 
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Damn gilyeongs condition really scared me for a second (also these comments I can’t 💀)
44,"Apr 21, 2021","Gilyeong, you're the mvp, baby, I love you. Titanoptera, you too (ps: could he be... what?? Finish your damn sentence before losing!)"
44,"Apr 21, 2021",that is the bravest commercial I've ever seen
44,"Apr 21, 2021","gilyeong is one of the best characters in the webtoon i will not elaborate (it's not necessary, we all know he's awesome) "
44,"Apr 21, 2021",dokja saw his only chance to beat up junghyeok and took it
44,"Mar 3, 2021",ahhh yes so the main character isn't really the main character 
44,"Mar 3, 2021","The Author of OmRe: ""That's a wrap! Good job everyone!!"""
44,"Mar 3, 2021","i wonder what the next scenario is and how they overcome it, the author has done and amazing job of creating a world where it feels like the possibilities are endless!"
44,"Apr 22, 2021",This story is long  but the Fourth Wall and the Character's reaction still gave me chills like when reading the novel.I will always insist that this novel and Webtoon must be turned into an Anime.
44,"Sep 11, 2021","The art this chapter was just godly, literally gave me chills. And the callback panels to the first chapters, this already is an incredibly thought out story"
44,"Jul 23, 2021",Titano is kinda cute
44,"Jun 19, 2021",Why do I feel like Dokja is the author of  TWSA? ._.
44,"Jun 16, 2021",the 'shooting star' part wow!!! so beautiful 💖
44,"Jun 15, 2021","""hehe titano"" why is he cute"
44,"Jun 9, 2021",finally a good place to stop and sleep
44,"Jun 8, 2021","The part when Gilyeong says ""Hehe..Titano"" is one one my most favourite part in the whole story, he so cool isn't he?P/s: Did that Simulation guy just blush?
"
44,"Jun 2, 2021","a thing they didn't make clear here that they did on the novel is: the cinema master didn't die because of dokja sword or something like that, he died because he peeked inside dokja's head, this WILL make a difference in the future so keep that in mind"
44,"May 18, 2021",you really got to look closely and appreciate the hard work it wouldve taken to draw all this
44,"May 5, 2021",Honestly wasn't expecting to see the prologue art again
44,"May 2, 2021",You know what also is goddamn pretty? THE FRIGGIN ART 
44,"Apr 29, 2021","Hmm, it wasn't shown here but it was implied in the novel that Titanoptera was actually the one that Gilyoung befriended since it's shown him a little bit of affection before it left them in the novel. Dokja even muses how this is even possible since the one they met was only in the movie scenario."
44,"Apr 29, 2021",Dokja got his one opportunity to punch the protagonist repeatedly.
44,"Apr 28, 2021",the fact that I read 43 long chapters of this web novel in a day proves how amazing this series is 
44,"Apr 28, 2021","Lol. The cinema master bein like, “wait, you’re the one who read all of my comics???” "
44,"Apr 28, 2021",48 hours of reading this and I have to wait 6 hours to read the next one .

44,"Jun 2, 2021","I'm pretty goddang sure that man, no, cinema manboi was the one who sent him the story. Maybe cinema manboi tried it before but didn't work out or somehing. Its also a possibility that this wasn't the first universe the constellations/dokabi(?) colonized and destroyed. The constellations may have been dicarded after one universe, but cinema manboi may have been left alive and knew what was about to happen once more. I dunno lol just sharing my weird and odd thoughts :)"

44,"Apr 24, 2021",I really like this story and find it amazing. I mean the art and characters and effects are just so good. My only complaint would be the people who already read it trying to spoil the story every single turn. I’m not talking about translation things or parts not seen in the chapter but those spoiling foreshadowing 
44,"Apr 23, 2021","Wait he fights the constellations? YES! Finally a character that might be able to stand up to mine own creation, he will likely fail but the beauty is in the battle!"

44,"Apr 21, 2021","Cinema Master just looked into the abyss and the abyss looked back. Also, it looked like Dokja didn't kill him, but he disappeared, because he learned of something he wasn't supposed to learn. "
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Did anyone else get confused by the ad and actually read it because you thought that it JUST MIGHT be part of the actual story? No? Just me? Okay... Hehehehe...

44,"Apr 16, 2021","it said the cinema master was a simulation, so I'm guessing that the real cinema master is actually the writer of the book. Just looking at his reaction to finding out who he was is a giveaway because he was blushing"

44,"May 5, 2021",My theory is somehow Dokja is either the author of the webnovel he read or the protag

44,"Apr 28, 2021",I'm going to read into this but is the Cinema Master the author of TWSA? once he tried to take control of Dokja he saw his thoughts and was surprised at what he saw and was going Dokja if he was a certain person but didn't because he was killed
44,"Apr 28, 2021","um, something just happened. It said the next episode would be free, but once it was, it was no longer available? P.S.. I am pretty sure that secret plotter is the 'author' or at least someone who is 'not week ' "

44,"Apr 15, 2021",I think Dojka’s mental being may end up being unstable as well because of his bookmarks since I think the more the skill levels up the more skills he will be able to copy along with certain personality traits while the skill is activated
44,"Apr 15, 2021",fast pass gang ✌️
44,"Apr 15, 2021","Wow I really picked the right chapter to fast pass! The art is GORGEOUS & the parallels between Dokja & Junghyeok’s lives are so interesting! Plus, I’m pretty sure all of this was just the prologue, cause I think this last fight was the intro fight in the first chapter!"

44,"Mar 3, 2021","[Blacklight Master Raveras was impressed with the battle, yet confused a little at the end. 5 coins were gifted] ""Could you be...?"" That Cinema Master knew something about Dokja that could have been important and he had to kill him before anything was said.

OK I sound dumb 






I'm leaving 






bye folks "
44,"Apr 21, 2021",That moment when the cinema master knew he fked up 
44,"Apr 21, 2021",!!! the art is amazing!! and the ad is an ingenious idea
44,"Apr 21, 2021",I loved the little ad at the end
44,"Apr 21, 2021",The cinema master recognised Dokja !
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Man I love this series
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Could Dokja be a constelation? Just think about it. For years he read a story that no one else read. Maybe the writer is a super constelation or one of those fluffy creatures!
44,"Apr 21, 2021",that was intense. but im glad Gilyeong is okay 🥺
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Bruh now that he said it it’s foreshadowing that it never came true huh 
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Dokja be like: Unlimited spear works
44,"Apr 21, 2021",it would be one of my favourite manhwa and webtoon but I have to wait to read next chapter 😭
44,"Apr 21, 2021",I love this comic this and solo leveling is the only thing I'm waiting for now these days
44,"Apr 21, 2021",[the constellation Prisoner of Broke Coins is sad dokja told us his wish ;-;]
44,"Apr 21, 2021",helpp dokja just stood there like Huh.. 
44,"Apr 21, 2021",I love gilyeong and his giant insects
44,"Apr 21, 2021","Gilyoung is cute and powerful, the moments between him and dokja ( head pats, hugs, etc) are cute , they are like a family 💕 "
44,"Apr 21, 2021",wait foreshadowing much? dokja won't make it to epilogue because he told them maybe?
44,"Apr 21, 2021","The fighting scenes are so goddamn amazing, the colors, actions and even the skills are good 🥲"
44,"Apr 21, 2021",The Cinema master recognized Fourth Wall?
44,"Apr 21, 2021",I feel bad for the author that they had to take an ad spot from a scam ad.
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Cute ad
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Dokja to Cinema Master: Bitch you thought!
44,"Apr 21, 2021",WhyYYyyYYYYyyyyYyyYy Can't I tAaKE A ScrEEnShOtTT iT LoOoKeD So COoL 😭 
44,"Apr 21, 2021","Is it just me, or does anyone else read Bihyung's (the Dokkaebi's) lines in like the English voice of Monokuma from Danganronpa "
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Well GOD DAMN
44,"Apr 21, 2021",WAHHH GUYS I'M SO EXCITED TO READ THE REST OF THIS I CAN'T WAIT THIS LONG
44,"Apr 21, 2021",love that the prologue scenes have come to an end
44,"Apr 21, 2021",so the fourth wall is a bunch of letters.....kinda disappointing but ok I guess.(says the one who couldn't imagine what it looked like and decided that it was a transparent blue wall 🙃)
44,"Apr 21, 2021","the thumbnail for the next episode looks like jihye is about to say ""b-b-baka!"""
44,"Apr 21, 2021",God this webtoon is so fcking good it's insane. can't wait for the upcoming scenarios and I wonder what exactly the cinema master was going to say........
44,"Apr 21, 2021",that was amazing
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Does that mean Dokja's going to die since he said his wish aloud? Or does this man have plot armour throughout the series?
44,"Apr 21, 2021","If there was a Dokja Kim limited edition summon, I would’ve considered downloading the app"
44,"Apr 21, 2021","Wait, Webtoons can have sponsorships? That’s cool."
44,"Apr 21, 2021","oh my freaking,.. so that what the fourth wall looks like? heol :000"
44,"Apr 21, 2021",The sad reader is pleased with the chapter
44,"Apr 21, 2021","I have two theories #1 Dokja being a reader is much more important than the Mc and people like him can become a constellation. #2 He is actually the author, a higher position than a constellation or whatever is higher "
44,"Apr 21, 2021","[The constellation, Maniac Silent Reader, said “Gilyoung, sweetie, you did great i’m proud of you. Besides, you got giant ancient praying mantis as your pet”]"
44,"Apr 21, 2021",wow uriel and abfd are looking pretty different in that advertisement /j

44,"Apr 21, 2021",wait so the last was an ad?? i though it was part of the story lol
44,"Apr 21, 2021",When the cinema master was trying to control him I was like but the 4TH WALL and then it worked!!!
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Y'all the shooting stars are here!!! Let the new scenario begin! >:D Oh I'm excited!
44,"Apr 21, 2021",That shooting star shot was the best panel so far.
44,"Apr 21, 2021","I am waiting for someone to unlock the skill ""plot armor"""
44,"Apr 21, 2021",I have to say I never expected this comic to advertise summoners war -- awesome. I don't play anymore cause taking care of my mental health was more important that taking care of my guild but that deal really is a good deal in that game. free nat5? that's nice 
44,"Apr 21, 2021","Gilyeong is so cute, really love that fraternal times"
44,"Apr 21, 2021","Bruh, he got 14,000 coins from one boss mission, COME ON"

44,"Apr 21, 2021",Lol. The Kings Event is not much of a fun but when the Prophets appeared it made Omniscient Reader lit up flames again.
44,"Apr 21, 2021","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN’T READ THE NOVEL!!! Unless you don’t care I guess... anyway, you’ve been warned"
44,"Apr 21, 2021",did...did the fourth wall just eat the cinema master?? but other than that the fourth wall and the stigmas look SO COOL
44,"Apr 21, 2021",When you’ve been reading WEBTOONS for 7 years and you’ve never gotten too comment ;-;
44,"Apr 17, 2021",how much our Dokja has grown from episode one-way it almost brings tears to my eyes. XD
44,"Apr 17, 2021",... I'm hoping they'll sold a physical copy of this I'm hooked and in love with everything about it

44,"Apr 16, 2021",like your cut g a little to much if you know what I'm saying
44,"Apr 15, 2021",Best series to spend coins in if you ask me [Spegettie had donated 5 Coins they where free ones but coins nonetheless]  [Spegettie is saddened by his lack of coins] [Spegettie relises he should probably get a job for coins] [Spegettie doesn't wanna]

44,"Mar 17, 2021","Well, now that we are near the starting of the arc...I hope the editor will use...(spoiler..kind of) 'Fables', instead of 'Stories'..!It sounds good, and has more meaning, you know!!"
44,"Mar 11, 2021","This cinema was so long and intense, i forgot they were still in the middle of the third scenario. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
44,"Mar 6, 2021",I often wonder of this story'll end up becoming our real lives someday. We all read up until the last chapter and it caps out over 1K or something  then we enter this world.
44,"Mar 5, 2021",Rip my fucking wallet 😭
44,"Mar 5, 2021",Dokja must be thinking “I am the captain now!”
44,"Mar 4, 2021",Shhhhh this is a learning experience for both of our Mc's dokja is learning about his goal and our gamer protagonist somehow learned that Dokja isn't what he seems.
44,"Mar 4, 2021",All caught up now! My cousin also cursed me because he was too busy binge reading instead of doing homework lol 😂😂😂

44,"Mar 3, 2021",Sjdkakskwkwosoqkwjwwj WOOOOOOOOOOOOO
44,"Jun 4, 2021",before i had a thought. now i am 100% sure. this entire story will end with him becoming a constellation (as we have seen other constellations were once people) and his title will be [omniscient reader] and maybe as a crazy twist he himself as a constellation watching the replay of the stream sent himself as a human the entire story to help him on his path to becoming a constellation
44,"May 2, 2021",I would ship Huiwon and Jihye if there wasn’t that age gap (don’t know how big the gap is but they are very cute).

44,"Jul 31, 2022",Listen I doubted Dokja when he said Joonghyuk would be much more powerful than him in the future since kdj is like op af and after the novel I can confirm that if you can last more than 5 minutes against Joonghyuk your a combat genius
44,"Jul 30, 2022",Huiwon and jihye look so similar 
44,"Jul 29, 2022","if that Cinema master tries to control my mind, he'd see anime titles and H sauces instead"

44,"Nov 26, 2021",Dokja wished to live to see the epilogue but he said it aloud so it won't come true. if that really happens then I'd say this is the best foreshadow EVER

44,"May 3, 2021","@Neptunfoeva 1. Yaoi doesn't mean rape it's just that a lot of them did have rape and so does BL. 2. Yaoi is literally BL with a couple that has too much sex until it becomes the main plot of the story, it's like porn literally all they do is have sex. There's a lot of BL's with rape, everything has rape in it, it's not based on genre. Just wanted to clear that misunderstanding up. They don't really make yaoi again tho cuz everything is now coming under the term BL. "

44,"Apr 21, 2021","I don't know why but when he said, ""When the sun rises,"" I think of Kim Sunwoo rapping lol. "
44,"Apr 21, 2021","hey, wait, Titanus? was that the same one, or was that just Gilyeong's exhaustion getting to him? I know it's the same species, somewhat, but still, that's a size difference"
44,"Apr 21, 2021",What I got a double ad for Omniscient reader
44,"Apr 21, 2021",when you see an ad of a game you alredy play
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Wow another scene from the epilogue 😍😍

44,"Apr 21, 2021","Look at that, the 4* wishes i did on Genshin Impact,"
44,"Apr 21, 2021",why tf the cinema master blushed in the end ?
44,"Apr 21, 2021",The constellation Mobile Gamer is intrigued by the collaboration.
44,"Apr 21, 2021",this is the first time I see ads on webtoon
44,"Apr 21, 2021",ok but which banner are those wishes from 
44,"Apr 21, 2021","As a player of Summoner's War, can vouch for this comic. but not the spawn rates lol. 0.05 chance I believe to pull those nat 5s you might be looking for. but hey, spawns aren't everything! It's what you do with them that counts. there is no such thing as a ""bad spawn""."
44,"Apr 21, 2021",How can Dokja not feel that he might be the protagonist in this world? (⊙_◎)
44,"Apr 21, 2021",I just hope we reach a point where the kid can control the insect equivalent of Godzilla
44,"Apr 21, 2021",also does anyone else hope/think the Cinema Master asks Dokja for an autograph? cuz that man had blushies and seemed kinda mega excited upon wondering Dokja's identity
44,"Apr 21, 2021",I have this huge crush on kim dokja he better stop being cool I cant do this;;;
44,"Apr 21, 2021","the joongdok gang has invaded this webtoon, they're a ship i dont make the rules 👌💖"
44,"Apr 21, 2021",the shooting star scene is such a bittersweet moment
44,"Apr 21, 2021",bruh I think it's not the fourth wall but an another ability or some tricks or etc that need to discover it's existence. 
44,"Apr 21, 2021",when you realized you already fastpassed this episode- 👄
44,"Apr 21, 2021","BS, Dokja getting a Laima and Rakan from the ads? Pfft. "
44,"Apr 21, 2021",woah

44,"Apr 21, 2021",WAIT THAT WAS AN AD I THOUGHT IT WAS REAL RJKRNDKFBBRT XD
44,"Apr 21, 2021",GET THAT FUCKING BAG KING LETS GO
44,"Apr 21, 2021","I’ve been reading the novel, and I guess ✨spoiler alert✨ it’s an ongoing joke in the novel of other characters thinking they’re a couple, but it’s not shown in the webcomic as far as I’ve seen, and as far as I know since this isn’t a romantic novel Kim Dokja doesn’t end up having a romantic relationship with anyone. But if someone wants to ship something, make sure to respect it doesn’t have to be canon for them to ✨fantasize✨ about it."
44,"Apr 21, 2021","Ahh the good old 4th wall, I really wanted to see it eat the cinema dungeons master tho... Anyways, Gilyeong baby I will always love you!!! So precious "
44,"Apr 21, 2021","""The fourth wall is shaken"" Me: What? What happens if it actually breaks? What would cause the fourth wall to Break??? So far, Dokja's been protected by that 4th wall. Does that mean he will truly become a character?"
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Looooool the Summoner's War AD was so funny with Camilla and Rakan on the background
44,"Apr 21, 2021","Ya know the song ""It Ends Tonight"" by all American rejects, that song really reminds me of this webtoon. I even played it often while reading this story. "
44,"Apr 21, 2021",I love dokja and gilyeong’s interactions and relationship lmaoo also seeing the scenes from the prolouge made me screammmm
44,"Apr 21, 2021",Gilyeong is Dokja's son now
44,"Apr 21, 2021",HOW COULD IT END SO SOON I NEED MORE😭😭the way it became so personal between Dokja and him made it so much more amazing. I really can’t wait to see what their conversation will be like. 
44,"Apr 21, 2021",I'm interested in what the simulation cinama master thought our boy is
44,"Apr 21, 2021",I have an inkling of a feeling that the Cinema Master knew something about Dokja’s reader skills.... cuz he said “you are..” before he got owned by Dokja
44,"Apr 21, 2021",The Constellation [Emotional Potato] is very proud of Gilyeong and believes he was the MVP of this scenerio. Dokja did good too.
44,"Apr 21, 2021",I have a truth bomb for you........your the protagonist 🤯

44,"Apr 15, 2021","Boo, the reward system should have like doubled the amount of money he got for killing Cinema master, the odds were completely against him"
44,"Apr 14, 2021","this is sooooo good !!! The way of telling the story, the art, everything 🤩"
44,"Apr 14, 2021",*distant dinosaur rawrs*
44,"Apr 7, 2021","Um idk why tho but the way the battle ended with ""Oh! Seoul... really... has been destroyed"" was REALLY Forth Wall Breaking & the foreshadowing... kinda reality gut punching you & calling you a Noob at Lv70 but you still in ""Boss"" tutorials & not World Boss 😬"

Because if yes and Junghyeok has regressed for the 3rd time now how come there is no news or actual places been destroyed in Seoul before this? Or did they just enter the novel universe or something omg someone please enlighten me I cannot rest well if I don’t get the answer
44,"Jul 3, 2022",I'm so glad Dokja killed the cinema master. What he did to Junghyeok.
44,"Jul 3, 2022",Poor Junghyeok he can rest now after that exhausting day he earned it.

44,"Mar 3, 2021",The constellation Dolefully Waiting  has donations on deck. 5 coins sponsored. 
44,"Mar 3, 2021",I get the feeling that maybe Dokja was actually a constellation. That maybe he wrote the novel for himself and found a way to get into the game? I dont know. It just seems that way because he's not really getting help from the outside. Like no particular constellations are giving him special treatment and none have reached out to him in a way that suggests they know who he really is and what he read. And its clear that the game makers and other constellations know nothing of his book.

Thanks for top comment this is my first time"
15,"Sep 16, 2020","Dokja is so cunning, I love it"
15,"Sep 16, 2020",Trolled thousands of people then dipped. 
15,"Sep 16, 2020","Dokja's negotiation came down to ""I'm a loser with no sponsors, but I could be YOUR loser with no sponsors."" "
15,"Sep 16, 2020","[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb' is curious about your phone's features...]
[5 coins have been sponsored.]"
15,"Sep 16, 2020","‚ÄúNo wonder your subscriber count is only three digit, figure‚Äù üòÇ "
15,"Oct 17, 2020","OOOH, A MAIN CHARACTER WHO ISN‚ÄôT A DUMBASS."
15,"Sep 16, 2020",My guy is about to face an A  difficulty mission with some mucus and thornsüòë
15,"Sep 16, 2020","I really like how the author is takimg the viewpoint of someome who isnt supposed to be the mc! it reminds me of the quote ""if your a pawn on the chess board then you have the ability to become anything u want"". "
15,"Sep 16, 2020",This is the best webtoon I've read in a while. Whenever there's a new episode I find myself frantically reading it over and then having to regretfully wait for the next to come out. It takes a special kind of story to make you yearn for the next chapter with such dedication each week. I literally can't wait for more.
15,"Oct 17, 2020","Man, Dokja's brain is getting bigger by the second. Also, I love our Dokkaebi's facesÔºà‚äôÔΩè‚äôÔºâ(‚äôÀç‚äô)"

15,"Oct 2, 2020",Dokja is revealing his inner rat bastard... üòÇüòÇü•∞ü•∞
15,"Sep 16, 2020","One of the personalities of the constellation ""Lazy Broke Weeb"" is sickened by the cliff hangers. "
15,"Sep 17, 2020",That's a title that SHOULD get an anime. Who's in for the ride???
15,"Sep 16, 2020","This WEBTOON is so genuinely interesting, he‚Äôs such a cunning guy and easily adapts to any and all situations. Plus the art does so well to compliment the story, this art studio is great first Solo Leveling now this I have to check out more of their work."
15,"Sep 16, 2020",That little flying fur baby makes some scary faces lol
15,"Oct 17, 2020",i wanna see everyone‚Äôs awestruck face when they find out dokja passed an A+ difficulty mission w just mucus and some raggedy thorns
15,"Oct 17, 2020",Secretive Plotter is probably gonna be my favorite constellation. From the time I first heard his name i knew something great was going to happen with him
15,"Oct 17, 2020",as they say knowledge is power... but so is bribing and a little blackmail
15,"Oct 17, 2020","I REALLY wasn't expecting Dokja to be so freaking ballsy this early on. I assumed he would try to be more nonchalant for a while to gain trust from key figures, but NOPE! He is just throwing caution to the wind at this point and making himself a big deal to keep the eyes of the constellations firmly on him."
15,"Sep 19, 2020",Yea it‚Äôs so satisfying reading the novel and then being able to see it visually üò≠üò≠ so many things I‚Äôm excited to see
15,"Sep 16, 2020",I will fast pass Every. Single. Episode. PERIOD

15,"Sep 16, 2020",Petition for this to become an anime I think I‚Äôve said this before oh we I‚Äôll say it again anyway I love dokja he really is smart 
15,"Oct 17, 2020",can u see how happy i am rn with this continuous update????? 
15,"Sep 16, 2020",I am SO ready for the next chapter! You can tell that this is going to be one of the best webtoons EVER!
15,"Oct 17, 2020","I know we never mentioned this, but Dokja is HELLA FINE. Thanks for listening to my TED-Talk."
15,"Oct 17, 2020","Dokja's cunning is amazing. Its one thing to have all the information about a world and know lots of things about objects, powers, etc. But it's another to use that knowledge to your advantage in a completely new situation. Here he has to 100% innovate to find a survival path in an unexpected situation, and he is doing just fine! Same with the negociation with bihyung, he came up with a system to his advantage which never existed before, simply with the knowledge of how things usually work. Wow."
15,"Oct 17, 2020",if this webtoon got merch I want a dokkebi pulshi
15,"Oct 17, 2020","That's why kids, read APOCALYPTIC NOVELS WITH ALL YOUR ATTENTION. you may never know when you need it :)"
15,"Sep 16, 2020",JUST TAKE IT ALL TAKE MY MONEY!!
15,"Oct 17, 2020","Dokja went from nervous from not understanding why his favourite web novel is happening in real life to so confident that he can get the Dokkaebi on his fingertips and make snarky remarks to a constellation ""The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon to displeased with your every move"" ""No one is asking you to watch me"" that's every YouTuber to their haters "
15,"Oct 17, 2020","""is your english patch malfulctioning"" bwhahahah. this is technically supposed to be Korean patch cause they're in Korea. Interesting choice by translators to change this."
15,"Oct 17, 2020",He's gonna give snek a grumbly tummy.
15,"Oct 17, 2020",[player dokja] has used [BIG ASS BRAIN] [everyone] has used [slow clapping in approval]
15,"Feb 23, 2021",this man is so fucking big brain
15,"Oct 17, 2020",if he ends up with an ability called plot armour I will laugh so hard lmao
15,"Dec 8, 2020",BRO THEY SHOULD MAKE THIS AN ANIME FOR SUREEEEE ITS SO AWESOMEEE
15,"Oct 17, 2020",nO oNeS fOrcInG yOu tO wAtCh mE LMAOO
15,"Apr 26, 2021","holy shit i love this, normally im not huge on these whole, apocalyptic world-turned-rpg webtoons but this one just has me so invested in dokja's every move-"
15,"Oct 18, 2020",I'm now starting to wonder what his phone's brand might be. I mean look- the battery is still not dead after 14 episodes!! O_o
15,"Oct 17, 2020",I want a plush Dokkaebi toy. üòã
15,"Oct 17, 2020",Dokja so witty. My small brain can't even understand what's happening eventhough I'm just reading
15,"Oct 17, 2020",the constelations go brrr
15,"Sep 16, 2020","Did I just spend EVEN MORE money for this story??? Yes, yes I didüòå *chef‚Äôs kiss*"
15,"Apr 29, 2021",Broooo! I died at ‚ÄúThe search button is on the bottom-right corner‚Äù LITERALLY DIED HAHAHA!!! (His expression was the MOOD!!! XD)
15,"Feb 25, 2021","Guys, this is just my theory but please listen. What if the secretive plotter is actually the author of TWSA. It isn't impossible for the author to be an other worldly entity especially when he has so much knowledge about the constellations. Also, this event is like an entertainment show for the constellations and the story of TWSA is the script behind it which was leaked to the protagonist i.e. Dokja. But this is just my theory though. "
15,"Feb 4, 2021","""No one is forcing you to watch me"" ENERGY HAHAHAH"
15,"Oct 17, 2020",BEST STORY. BEST PLOT. BEST EVERYTHING. 
15,"Oct 17, 2020","I've been looking at the numbers. This webtoon has less than 15 episodes so far (not counting fast pass) and not only has the first couple of episodes have more than 99,999 likes, but the subscriptions are almost to 1 mil. On top of that, the rating is 9.89. I haven't seen a lot of webtoon with a rating this high. That surely says something about this comic. No wonder webtoons is pushing for this series so much. I mean, the story is amazing and unique so I can understand why, but still."
15,"Apr 28, 2021",I love how Dokja first seemed like a timid dumbass but now he's a badass
15,"Feb 25, 2021",hmmm... do i smell.. friendship? hope it is
15,"Nov 11, 2020",The secret plotter seems to be someone who's able to pull all the strings from behind the scenes. I find them to be the most interesting constellation. | What brand is his mobile phone? It doesn't run out of battery. I need one like it. 
15,"Oct 17, 2020",I honestly love kim dokja and his confident ass so much
15,"Oct 17, 2020","Lol. Dokja thinks he's some sort of useless Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff (not that they're useless) when he's really a Slytherin in disguise. Seriously, kid? [Snorts]"
15,"Oct 17, 2020","this is amazing, books and comics about incredibly smart characters that just exploit the system because the know it so well is so satisfying"
15,"Sep 16, 2020",I wish I could fast pass more fast passes ü•∫üòû
15,"Jun 14, 2021",‚ÄúNo one os forcing you to watch me‚Äù <‚Äî lmao I love our MC
15,"May 22, 2021",I love the dokkaebi and our MC chemistry
15,"Apr 26, 2021",I usually don't read action webtoons or stories but this is really amazing
15,"Apr 14, 2021","the dokkaebi is really adorable imo, i love how reluctant it is to give dokja anything"
15,"Mar 10, 2021","Dokja: just a boring , ho-hum office worker with no real prospects for a future. || Also Dokja: cunning master plotter and negotiator, able to come up with plans on the fly and fearless in the face of terrifying realities"
15,"Feb 26, 2021",Why is everyone so good looking??? Even the dokkaebi is cute... and here I am looking like a potato 
15,"Feb 21, 2021","""curios about your plan"" ""displeased with your every move"" i can't stop laughing üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
15,"Feb 1, 2021",love a smug bastard of an mc
15,"Dec 18, 2020",the concept of this manhawa is really interesting.
15,"Dec 7, 2020",okay but dokja is technically a fanboy(i mean he knows so much) so the real message is BEING INTERESTED AND PASSIONATE IN SOMETHING no matter what it is WILL SAVE YOU SOME TIME SO KEEP DOING WHAT YOU LOVE
15,"Nov 12, 2020","I should be working on schoolwork. but hey, at least im having fun"
15,"Oct 21, 2020","this is the greatest webtoon i have read in a very long time, i hope that this becomes a very popular anime, i would so watch that"

15,"Oct 17, 2020","this webtoon. the plot is, at heart, not extremely unique, but like every good story, that's part of what makes it so damn good. the world-building is incredible, the characters are intriguing as hell, and the plot is perfect. just the right amount of suspense, just the right amount of tension; it's fucking mind-blowing. the art is the icing on the cake. should I go to the effort to read the novel? is it even better, because the webtoon is brilliant!"
15,"Oct 17, 2020",I love our little dokkaebi. All of his reactions are just the best. 
15,"Oct 17, 2020",how is his phone still alive tho
15,"Oct 17, 2020",Am I the only one wondering how tf his phone survived and isn‚Äôt malfunctioning 
15,"Oct 17, 2020",I can't believe how clever the artist is in depicting bihyung's facial expressions one second he scared the shit out of us üò± and then the other time we melt over how cute he is üòç
15,"Oct 17, 2020",Dokja is quite different from the typical MC's which is very Refreshing.

15,"Oct 17, 2020","I have read so many webtoons since 2014, as of now I'm reading like almost 50 different ones ranging from all genres but it's the first time since 2 years that I found myself crushing over a fictional character. I love Dokja and his sexy brain <3"
15,"Jun 8, 2021",ngl i want him and that small white yeti thing to be friends
15,"May 20, 2021",The thing- I forget what it‚Äôs called is kinda cute even when it smiles pretty funny their relationship so far 
15,"Apr 28, 2021","I usually don't go for this kind of Webtoon, but I have to admit this one is really good. I'm fascinated with the story."
15,"Oct 22, 2021",he is damn hot
15,"Apr 27, 2021","I have so many good things to say about this comic that I don‚Äôt know where to begin. For one thing, I love that the character can know the future without becoming overpowered, he succeeds not because he has overwhelming power, but because he can use exclusive knowledge of the world and how it functions along with his own intelligence and cunning to get through it in the best way possible."
15,"Mar 25, 2021",Dokja is literally the definition of SLYTHERIN
15,"Mar 24, 2021",How the hell does his phone still work

15,"Dec 13, 2020",the dokkaebi looks cute üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
15,"Oct 17, 2020",This gives me major Tower of God vibes. I can tell the story is super detailed and well written all ready. I can‚Äôt wait for all the world building and crazy twists the author throws at us haha
15,"Oct 17, 2020","Dokja never looked like a person with such tremendous will power, presence of mind, and smartness. He has kind heart but he also knows how to make a smart move to save himself as well. In short he's a genius who was living as a commoner under normal conditions but when the tough time came he's acting like a leader. I'm so much excited to see more layers of his character.."
15,"Oct 17, 2020","he picked mucus because mucus is acid proof. he's probably going to use the spikes to climb up the walls of it's stomach, and coated the spikes in mucus so they don't melt. not a spoiler, just an educated guess."
15,"Oct 17, 2020",HOW DOES HIS PHONE WORK!??!?!
15,"Oct 17, 2020",Dokja is bae üòö

15,"Oct 17, 2020","I‚Äôm guessing he shoved the thorns into the acid with the mucus to not only stop the acid but to make the thing he‚Äôs in (forgot the name and don‚Äôt really want to go back) to either throw up, sneeze, or just explode"
15,"Oct 17, 2020",dokja dissing dokkaebi left and right like it‚Äôs nothing

15,"Oct 17, 2020",This comic is big brain and I love it.
15,"Oct 17, 2020","I like this more than Solo Leveling actually. Solo Leveling hits hard with OP, but works hard. However, Omniscient Reader is works hard to be OP.  World Building is so interesting! Wish I had those 2000+ chapters"
15,"Oct 16, 2020",I saw the first couple chapters of this and was blown away. Decided to go read the book (which is completed). binged the whole thing. It is the single greatest literary masterpiece I have ever seen. this is only the beginning!

15,"Apr 26, 2021",I had heard many good opinions of this story but it is more wonderful than I thought
15,"Apr 24, 2021",I'm actually disappointed he didn't pick secretive plotter xD I really want him to team up with him

15,"Feb 11, 2021","to be honest I don't know if anyone is still reading this, but let me just say that this is my first webtoon I am reading and I'm going to be honest, I don't know if I'm going to find a story that is going to surpass this one"

15,"Oct 17, 2020",What if. Secretive Plotter is the author of TWSA o-o
15,"Oct 17, 2020",[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' arrives late and complaines why the channel is closed]

15,"Apr 13, 2021",How did he not fail the scenario? It literally had the system pop up saying he did. Is it because of the hidden scenario? He probably should still have to pay the 5100 coins.

15,"Oct 19, 2020","my favorite character in a comic or show is basically always a side character, but I think Dokja's gonna change that. I just love the way he's so smug, and how he negotiates"
15,"Oct 19, 2020",Is no one else gonna talk about how many updates we got this week!?!?! Thank you from the depths of my heart!!!! :D :D :D :D :D 
15,"Oct 19, 2020",Is it strange that I find the Dokkeabi so adorable when he was looking at Dokja and heavily thinking about taking his offer and starting a contract? Like he's so fuzzy and I wanted to laugh and hug himüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è Also I laughed throughout the discussion üòÇit was just so funny and the Dokkeabi just not knowing what to do made me laugh moreüòÇüíÄ AWWWWWWW Dokkeabi is so cute while he's trying to explain that the Stream was shut down as a errorüòÇü•∫

15,"Oct 18, 2020","lol I'm seeing people saying this should be a anime. NO, no it should not because it would go to crunchyroll and they have ruined 2/3 webtoons (only saying two because I didn't read TOG) I'm so scared for noblesse right now, they already dropped a character in ep 2. i don't want this to have the same treatment. "
15,"Oct 18, 2020",The dokkaebi is actually so adorable I just want to squish him
15,"Oct 18, 2020",i just realized that this is daily üòçüòç

15,"Oct 18, 2020",The Dokkaebi is still cute when it's mad... üòÜ
15,"Oct 18, 2020",and so the world's biggest rodent was born
15,"Oct 18, 2020",I wish this webtoon will be animated cause it is amazing.

15,"Oct 18, 2020",How does one think that far ahead 
15,"Oct 18, 2020",Damn that's hella interesting. My brother really is stupid for not reading this even tho I offered on him to read it
15,"Oct 18, 2020","I think the fan translations are actually moving much faster than once a week, this webtoon is gonna have a hard time keeping readers (though I‚Äôm more than happy to read the same thing twice)"
15,"Oct 18, 2020",Dokja ate that shi left no mf crumbs
15,"Oct 18, 2020",Started reading the novel because I couldn‚Äôt wait on the WEBTOON. Now I keep coming back so I can see the cool parts I‚Äôve read illustrated. Ah hopefully they make this an anime someday as well too. If god of high school can be an anime then idk why lookism isn‚Äôt one yet. And this one should be one soon too 
15,"Oct 18, 2020",i don't understand why people think dokja's ugly. i mean he's kinda okay tho??? plus he has a big brain so
15,"Oct 18, 2020",The worst thing here is-   IM BROKE
15,"Oct 18, 2020",the Dokkaebi is like an on and off switch. On one scene its cute and on the next one its scary ü§£ü§£ü§£
15,"Oct 18, 2020","why do I feel dokja(author) entered an arrangement with the dokkaebi(webtoon),(the 5 day survival system)üòÖ"
15,"Oct 18, 2020",Give me coins üò≠ Need to read next episode
15,"Oct 18, 2020","So I‚Äôm going to read daily episodes during this event, get free coins, and then promptly spend those coins on getting another episode. Thanks, author!! And thanks to you translators for bringing it to us English readers!!"

15,"Oct 18, 2020","Anyone else more interested in the ""secretive plotter"" than the plot? "
15,"Oct 18, 2020",the fact that all of these episodes are being released daily is going to kill me when they aren't released daily anymore. lol
15,"Oct 18, 2020",Haven‚Äôt been on WEBTOON for a while. And this is by far my favorite! Everything is just amazing! üòç
15,"Oct 18, 2020",i‚Äôm so happy this event exists :) i love reading this webtoon!

15,"Oct 18, 2020",Dokja is living our dreams and nightmares all at once!!! ü§©üò∞ü•≥üò≠‚ú®üò±
15,"Oct 18, 2020",Are you kidding me right now? Right at the best part?
15,"Oct 18, 2020","As a novel reader, I can only say how incredible the studio is at pacing the webtoon in a way that mirrors the novel at its greatest potential so far. I wouldn‚Äôt say it is slow paced, this will cover 500  chapters of content after all. The suspense, anticipation and excitement I‚Äôve felt is so similar to how I‚Äôve always felt reading the novel up to now. I can‚Äôt wait for all the arcs to be fleshed out in color. 
[The constellation A Longtime Fan expresses their admiration for this story]"
15,"Oct 17, 2020",I am curious to know who TWSA's author.  Cuz they must have lived through this to write it down. lmao

15,"Oct 17, 2020",Deal or no deal vibes
15,"Oct 17, 2020",I am so curious about his plan
15,"Oct 17, 2020","Soo... Does anyone get the feeling that Dokja is the Author of TWSA? His Ability is directly tied to the story he read, let's see if I can make this make sense. Assuming he's the Author, there could be rules that prevented him from revealing any details about himself in the story. His Ability acts similar to a Regressor but instead of restarting at each failure, he observes the entire scenario from start to end. Then ""writes it down"" and the world resets. Just speculating here.."
15,"Oct 17, 2020",this is one of the best webtoon I have read after Noblesse.
15,"Oct 17, 2020","Jesus Christ, for the first time I got really tempted to buy coins. This webseries is amazing! I'm addicted to it! :D"

15,"Oct 17, 2020",Dokja manipulating dokkaebi like it's something he does everyday
15,"Oct 17, 2020",One of the best story line 
15,"Oct 17, 2020",Anyone else read Dokkaebi voice as Bill Cipher? 
15,"Oct 17, 2020",Dokkaebi sounds like it should be a Pok√©mon lol
15,"Oct 17, 2020",Can we all agree that Dokkaebi looks like a furry Monokuma?
15,"Oct 17, 2020","Wow I have no idea if I could remember any of these nouns but I‚Äôm diggin this story so far, I‚Äôm hooked "
15,"Oct 17, 2020","Not gonna lie, I didnt have great expectations for this, but I love an MC that's clever."
15,"Oct 17, 2020",I have a theory... the events will repeat and I'm the person who read all 3000 episodes but my skill to read at super speed was activated early and that's why I read this in like 5 secs 
15,"Oct 17, 2020",this is gonna be some anime smartness dokja is gonna kill him so hardüòÖ
15,"Oct 17, 2020",then it could be very possible that Dokja is an awakened incarnation??

Main character conveniently getting the right ability, conveniently having fourth wall, conveniently getting the eggs for money to majorly buff stamina, etc. Flashy story, little substance"

50,"Apr 14, 2021","Oh no...Dokja you look so sus at the end. Favorite expressions from this episode: 😛 and 😲😲. Also a tidbit from the novel that didn't make it on the webtoon: during group chat, Dokja apologizes to Heewon for being snappy w/her in the tent when he was YJH roleplaying"
50,"Apr 14, 2021","What Dokja says: let's be friends.
What Dokja actually means: I'm going to trick you into being a willing hostage."
50,"Apr 14, 2021","The prophets: ""All the way to CHAPTER 50!!""    Dokja: 👁👄👁"
50,"Apr 14, 2021",Am I the only pumped for when the other prophets find out he actually read the entire book 
50,"Apr 14, 2021","Everyone talking about Dokja picking up kids and about to destroy the false prophets, but what really impressed me is his memory and attention to details. He not only remember the novel but also THE VIEWS EVERY CHAPTER HAD!!?🤯"
50,"Apr 14, 2021","Everyone is playing survival horror, while Dokja is playing Pokémon xD"
50,"Apr 14, 2021","""Let's be friends!"" and so a child was kidnapped that day, never to be seen again"
50,"Apr 14, 2021",How does every chapter manage to feel long and short at the same time. 😭
50,"Apr 17, 2021",Dokja becoming the local orphanage...
50,"Apr 14, 2021",is it just me or should this be in the line up for next crunchy roll originals already or what cause this book is incredible 
50,"Apr 14, 2021",Don't even kid Dokja you don't wanna kill em to preserve the plot you wanna slaughter the guy who said you aren't hot
50,"Apr 14, 2021","next chapter: ""dokja gets another son"""
50,"Apr 14, 2021",the way Dokja talks himself up to be a real pain in Junghyeok's ass is top notch
50,"Apr 14, 2021",It’s the end of the world and Dokja decided he wanted to be a dad
50,"Apr 14, 2021",[The constellation 'Lazy Broke Weeb ' was drowned with the flow of information and is currently finding a paper to write of these stuffs.][5 coins have been sponsored.]
50,"May 1, 2021","I love that Dokja seems to be a true Chaotic Neutral aligned character. A lot of authors tend to make characters who are as pragmatic as Dokja boring, but this story side steps that neatly. I love it."
50,"Apr 14, 2021","To anyone seeing this, have a great day."
50,"Apr 14, 2021",damn that was some shameless lying
50,"Apr 14, 2021",Last time Dokja spent 5000 coins to up his agility and peek on the guy's phone. This time he spent 2000 coins like: 'Whatcha saying?' 😂😏 
50,"Apr 14, 2021",When the main character who isn’t a main character pretends to be a main character when he’s not.
50,"Apr 14, 2021","It's interesting that Dokja's concerned about them messing up the story accidentally since he's basically been doing that on purpose for his own ends since the very beginning. I mean, isn't Junghyeok supposed to have 8 or more regressions? Since he's only in his third, and Dokja theorizes their version of the universe ceases to exist when he regresses again, by definition he has to completely alter the story."
50,"May 26, 2021",I love how dokja is just going around adopting kids. 😂
50,"Apr 14, 2021","Dokja like, ""Oh, all the way to chapter 50?...get on my level you plebs"""

50,"Apr 14, 2021",The 48 people who think they know more than Dojka are in for a splendid surprise 😈😈
50,"May 28, 2021","Secret Plotter calls them shameless lies, but really Dokja is being quite honest! He even said the prophet has taken to impersonating “him” lately. If they can’t pick up a hint like that then it’s their own fault lol"
50,"May 26, 2021",Failed to be handsome enough. Saved by terrible anger management
50,"Jun 2, 2021","""The author said Junghyeok was good looking"" ""But he definitely is Junghyeok Yu. Look at his temper!"" LMAO THESE GUYS REALLY CAME AFTER HIM"
50,"Jun 2, 2021",“Are you gonna tell me you think he’s good-looking?” “People have different standards” “You prick” lol.
50,"Jun 2, 2021","DOKJA, YOU CLEVER SHAMELESS BITCH, TALKING ABT A DANGEROUS PROPHET WHEN IT'S JUST YOU- I LOVE IT"
50,"Apr 19, 2021","What do you mean he's not ""good-looking"" when this chapter alone had more pretty shots of Dokja than I could count 😭"
50,"Jun 2, 2021","""He knew the future just as you did. A lot more than you actually."" Wow, the subtle brag. (Then again, I'd be proud to read over 3,000 chapters so brag away)"

50,"Apr 14, 2021",Taunting the Secretive Plotter was kinda cheeky even for Dokja xD I love this series.
50,"Jun 2, 2021","i think Dokja picking up kids as allies is clever. Not only kids have good chance at getting better, but also forming a relationship with them is easy. Cuz kids are loyal and wont lie. i mean most of them. idk about rn kids "

50,"Jun 2, 2021","Dokja Kim, who has singled handedly done more to change the story than Junghyeok Yu has done to follow it: “I can’t let these idiots run rampant, they’ll change the story!”"
50,"Apr 19, 2021",Dokja is basically Batman at this point
50,"Jun 2, 2021",The likes in this comic is getting lesser and lesser. And i don't want to be in the situation like dokja. So let's all be prophets and um take dokja's side if this becomes real. What I'm saying is like the comic. ☺

50,"Jun 3, 2021","I can’t believe how intelligent and open minded Dokja is.He is literally able to outsmart anyone.Even though some of the characters may hold more power, he will always win due to the fact that he is able to think outside of the box and outsmart anything.Even if he didn’t read twsa I am sure he would have been fine.And he IS handsome!"

50,"Jun 3, 2021","So.... i am kind of dissapointed that the highest prophet dropped at chapter 50 whern there were more then 3thousand. Wouldve been quite shady if there were people who red at least till 1000 chapter, so we could have more menacing enemies. But i think author knows what he is doing. I just really hope this story will be a long ass one, not a straightforward shortie like sololeveling. Would be cool if this will have 3500 chapters as well :D"
50,"Jun 3, 2021",of course there are people using their knowledge for their own gain like dokja. anyone in their right mind would use what they know to advance in a world like this
50,"Jun 3, 2021",He did the Kunimi tongue thing!!
50,"Jun 3, 2021","ok not sure if anyone has said this yet but I just need to say what if girlie with black hair and a ponytail (and the grey sweater) thinks that is the child they ""adopted"" cause that would be funny. (Well if the kid does decide to come cause I haven't read that far yet) "

50,"Jul 2, 2021","Aw man, silly casuals messing up the story- I kid, I kid but they really did end up making things worse because they didn't know...most of the story apparently since they didn't get even 50 chapters in. RIP. Anyway, Dokja's adopted another kid after freeing him from the hypnosis. Let's see how this goes~ ...I can't believe there are 48 Readers too, damn. And the other 12 are snobby about it and apparently might be sus."
50,"Jun 19, 2021","I found an error in the panel after the one where the prophets ask Dokja to take them under his wing, the flag in the following panel should be navy blue not red."

50,"Jun 9, 2021",Well Dokja isn't as pretty as YuBut we'll manage 🤧🚶‍♀️
50,"Jun 4, 2021",Note: the original comment about him not being good looking was more like “his face is blurry” with negative connotations. It gets important later on!
50,"Jun 2, 2021","I still want Dokja to kill that guy who said he was unattractive. Not because of that, but Huiwon was about to say that he was one of the guys that tried to rape her and left her for dead in the toxic smoke. And people who are rapists deserve to die"

50,"Jun 3, 2021",Did y’all know know will die in a few episodes?
50,"Jun 2, 2021","The more the story progresses, the more it became cliche and dull.
Put some twist or something. I don't want to see how TWSA ends. Because. technically, the story is already screwed up and doesn't really follow it's original ending. 

I want to see why TWSA became a reality to their world. I want to see another dimensional character who reads the story of Omniscient Reader and became a reality to their world where Dokja is the Protagonist, while Dokja believes that Junghyeok Yu is the main char"

51,"Jun 9, 2021","I love how meta this whole story is. We are the readers of a webtoon based on a web novel about a guy who read a web novel.

51,"Jun 9, 2021",Dokja said support creators 👏😤
51,"Jun 9, 2021","If you can't pay with coins, pay with Likes at least and a good Rating if you find it interesting.Can't imagine a person that will dislike it."

51,"Jun 9, 2021","""You should have read it to the end"" that line gave me chills."
51,"Jun 10, 2021","I don't know if it's because of the power of protagonism, but am I the only one who finds Dokja more attractive than Junghyeok Yu? 🥺"
51,"Jun 10, 2021","""Should've read to the end.""  What a one-liner. XD"
51,"Jun 10, 2021",The Dokja slander is real lol
51,"Jun 10, 2021",What's Dokja looking so pretty for (I swear he gets prettier each chapter)

51,"Jun 10, 2021",xd the author expressing his own feelings about pirating
51,"Jun 10, 2021","Those prophets seems to have no taste in novels. If it is anything similar to this webtoon, Then I say they are idiots Who does not like overcomplicated reading"
51,"Jun 10, 2021","[Hermit cloak] 3.000 coins [Mental estimulant] 3.000 coins. Having ""The hermit king of the shadows"" priceless, for everything else, there is Dokkaebi's shop."
51,"Jun 9, 2021",They said he wasn't handsome and he took it personally 
51,"Jun 9, 2021",Are we Disciples now that we've read 50 episodes of this masterpiece?
51,"Jun 9, 2021","i can't believe they actually don't consider dokja as ""handsome"" yet. their standard is way too high 😂😭"

51,"Jun 9, 2021",I find it funny that they are confused how people could read past 50 episodes and yet here we are
51,"Jun 9, 2021","The comment about his looks lmao!It's weird, I've read the complete fan translated novel for this series so I guess that counts as pirating. But no one is officially translating it and this webtoon will take a decade to complete all 551 novel chapters in webtoon form 💀 Soooo, I don't really see why not."
51,"Jun 9, 2021",Dokja Yu is cursed
51,"Jun 9, 2021","So the lesson is, don't pirate 😌"
51,"Jun 9, 2021","Damn, they really called us out like that, huh"
51,"Jun 9, 2021","i love they added "" ᗯᗴᗷTOOᑎ TOO..."" "
51,"Jun 9, 2021","bruh, even if you don't like the story you should be willing to pay for it if it is a potential matter of life or death. Don't worry about pirating it, just buy the freaking coins... come to think of it, if it updated weekly for 10 years, that's 520 episodes, give or take. Can we get 520 episodes, author?"
51,"Jun 9, 2021",the fact that this is my first time commenting in webtoon....nice work as always [The constellation Aimee Wadznah is like what she's reading]
51,"Jun 9, 2021",ahaha I wonder how the pirates of this Webtoon translated that anti-piracy message 😂🤣
51,"Jun 9, 2021",little do the prophets know...
51,"Jun 9, 2021",Junghyeok Yu is more handsome than dokja which hurts his ego 😂😂😂
51,"Jun 9, 2021","Even if like Dokja I read every chapter until it finished, with my crappy memory, I'd be lucky to remember anything that happened before the chapter I just finished reading."
51,"Jun 9, 2021",I can’t take Dokja seriously with the mask thing that changes appearance lol :/
51,"Jun 9, 2021",the three of them straight up fanboying over Junghyeok Yu 😂
51,"Jun 2, 2021","I am spending my coins, what else do you need webtoon 😂"
51,"Apr 24, 2021",When Dokja (cosplaying as Joonghyuk) smiled softly when Donghoon said he was gonna trust him just this once...🥺💖 
51,"Sep 15, 2021",The author secretly telling me to stop using illegal/unauthorized sites when I watch anime or read webtoons.

51,"Jun 10, 2021",Dokja is really into this impersonating crap
51,"Jun 10, 2021",“How could anyone read 50 episodes of this crap?” Idk I just keep coming back for more ig 
51,"Jun 10, 2021","""pay for it if you want to read it!"" people who don't buy fast pass and wait: *maniacal laughter*"
51,"Jun 10, 2021","For as furious as I am that the <prophets> dissed Dokja's good looks, I have to admit, the regressor is preeeetty good lookin'. That jawline is sharper than cheddar cheese...💫"
51,"Jun 10, 2021","The thing about pirating webtoons is: you really don’t have to. It’s right here. All free. You can pay for early access but you. Don’t. Have. To. Even if you only ever read the free episodes, you can support a series by interacting in the fandom that is based out of this platform.  Because as fandom grows, there will be people who can and will give money to the creators. (I do wish Webtoon was a bit more transparent about how much and based on what they pay their creators though)"
51,"Jun 10, 2021",(stressedweeb has made an oath to read until the very last chapter of this comic)
51,"Jun 10, 2021","Them saying reading till ep 50 is impressiveDokja: *the only one who read all the 3,149 episodez*"

51,"Jun 9, 2021","Omg I don't like Dokja with Junghyeok's face, he looks so weird!!🤣 Don't get me wrong Junghyeok is a handsome mf but I prefer Dokja as is😍"
51,"Jun 9, 2021",the grin + the “you should have read to the end.” 😼
51,"Jun 9, 2021",IDK ppl I liked his looks before wearing the mask now he ain't 🤪
51,"Jun 9, 2021",i hope this webtoon has over 3000 episodes and lasts 10 years like I would love that!
51,"Jun 9, 2021",i love how they are calling Dokja ugly
51,"Jun 9, 2021","The Constellation [Emotional Potato] is pleased with how things have unfolded and is excited to see what happens next. Dokja is attractive, especially when he smirks the way he did there when he told them they should of read to the end. Also I'm happy the kid trusted him. I hope he takes the kid with him when they return to their group and he chooses to go with them."
51,"May 23, 2021","when he changed his face though, their reaction😂😂😂....I had to go back and compare how did he look like in the previous panel 😅😅"
51,"Apr 21, 2021",I can’t wait for Dokja to be like “surprise” and destroy everyone once their out of use.
51,"Oct 20, 2021",You should've come to shiratorizawa
51,"Aug 22, 2021",Unlike some people I am definitely reading past the 50th episode 😎
51,"Aug 8, 2021",“lol who would read 50 chapters of that crap” and then there’s Dokja who read over THREE THOUSAND
51,"Aug 1, 2021",these 2 grown ass men fanboying lol
51,"Jul 31, 2021",But But I Love Dokja face so much! More than that  damn protagonist 
51,"Jul 7, 2021",How is KDJ gonna say people aren’t stupid enough to show off their flags and then have his poking out in the back 😭
51,"Jun 21, 2021","all the prophets are saying stuff like ""people who read past episode 50 aren't right in the head"" and it's in episode 50 it's almost like you're trying to tell me to stop reading this, but I shan't stop."
51,"Jun 14, 2021",helppp the pirating comment 😭
51,"Jun 11, 2021",wait did he just get mad at someone for trying to find a copy of a deleted book during the apocalypse? 
51,"Jun 10, 2021",Not giving specific spoilers for the webnovel but hint to WEBTOON readers: the line “how do you even read 50 episodes of this crap? Those guys aren’t normal lol” is actually a decently important clue for later on.....
51,"Jun 10, 2021",Dokja looks so weird with his new face :0
51,"Jun 10, 2021","Man, He really just put down his flag and said ""Ya'll are fake fans."""
51,"Jun 10, 2021","Dokja's new look is nice, but I personally preferred it before the style changed. However, it doesn't change how much I love his character xD"

51,"Jun 9, 2021","""webtoons too"" 😂"
51,"Jun 9, 2021","Are there actually Webtoons like this with so few readers by this chapter? (Serious question here, I'm new to online-only published stories but Ifind it hard to believe so few would start reading and so many would dip out like that... and then to have an author keep going for years with just 1 reader- Props to that writer!)"
51,"Jun 9, 2021",bruh what kinda disrespect in saying Dokja isn’t attractive 😡🤚🏽
51,"Jun 9, 2021",but Dojka..... I liked your face man!

51,"Apr 21, 2021",Question: Is there an actual novel called TWSA? 3k eps? Or is that just the setting of this novel? I'm slow on the uptake
51,"Apr 21, 2021",Like if you think Dokja should just make every reader one of his lackeys or sum like that
51,"Apr 21, 2021",I wish I could just will internet onto my phone without pay for it
51,"Apr 21, 2021","Damn bro, Dokja really did them dirty like that. I love how he just casually takes all their stuff like ""This is mine now, thank you 😙"""

51,"Jun 22, 2021","""Pay for it if you want to read it, you bastard"" YES TOTALLY AGREE NEVER EVER PIRATE A SERIES. Be mindful about the author's effort. READ IT LEGALLY NOT ILLEGALLY. "
51,"Jun 20, 2021","Hey, we are just in episode 50, does anyone realize? Wait, the author isn't planing on turning this into a TWSA number 2, is it? Let's see who can read till the end"
51,"Jun 19, 2021",It is uncomfortable to see Dokja with Junghyeok's face😅
51,"Jun 19, 2021",so even if there are other readers till ep 50 our dokja is still the only one who has read the hole series!! :))
51,"Jun 19, 2021","Hence, lesson learned!! Never leave a novel in between, webtoon too."
51,"Jun 18, 2021",My god i love this so far uhhhhhhh
51,"Jun 18, 2021",when dokja hasn't realized  he's the main character 
51,"Jun 17, 2021",When it said “webtoons too” that just took me out
51,"Jun 17, 2021",please please please please make this into an animated series. please
51,"Jun 16, 2021",“You should have read to the end.” SO BADASS I LOVE IT

51,"Jun 10, 2021",imagine if this comes true and it's based on this......aye at least alot of us is reading it
51,"Jun 10, 2021",the true lesson of this story is to support your favorite authors/artists and I'm all here for it.
51,"Jun 10, 2021","A moment that went unnoticed by many was that the new shota's constellation thanked Dokja for his help, not that he was freed from hypnosis but that her peotegé had shown some progress in his social anxiety.  They should be really moved of the situation that's why she decided to help him"
51,"Jun 10, 2021",I love how the prophets started totally fangirling over Dokja when they realizaed they got played bc he's THAT FUCKING SMART
51,"Jun 10, 2021",Ep. 50 - this makes us disciples

51,"Oct 19, 2021","Don't worry... I'm not posting spoiler... Butwas binging this over the past couple of nights when I noticed a few chapters ahead of here that there wasn't 99,999+ favorites anymore... went back a couple of chapters only to notice that it was ""CHAPTER 50!!!"" that was the last Chapter with 99,999+ favorites... kinda creepy considering that it was around the SAME POINT IN TWSA THAT THE LAST FEW PEOPLE (other than Dokja) STOPPED READING!!!"
51,"Sep 22, 2021",End of Chapter 50 and the chapter likes are no longer 99999+ LOL. Good deal of droppers :) (98384 at this time)

51,"Sep 11, 2021",its weird seeing Junghyeok smile for the first time because of Dokja using his face 🤣 but god I want to see that smile more often 😩
51,"Aug 21, 2021",Even in fiction people refuse to pay for anything 
51,"Aug 11, 2021","763th got it right.

51,"Jun 29, 2021",Webtoon author low-key (not really) calling people out for pirating webtoons. 
51,"Jun 24, 2021",OMG dokja gaining fans. so funny and cute
51,"Jun 23, 2021",i’m gonna be so confused in the next chapter with dokja and junghyeok 😭
51,"Jun 19, 2021",im so sorry im one of those people who looks  for pirates ots because i don't have money yet when im old enough to have a job i would definitely support the creators

I... I do"
51,"Jun 15, 2021","Dokja with jungyeoks face, just does it.😚👌"
51,"Jun 13, 2021","That piracy part made me freaking laugh. It's the warning for those who'll pirate a series that an author/s had worked so hard on to make it so enjoyable. 
I love this series.❤️"
51,"Jun 13, 2021","I can't pay becuase i'm broke,  so i  have to wait until the episode is free. T-T"

51,"Jun 11, 2021",dokja wiht yjh's face is what i see in my nightmares lmfaoo
51,"Jun 11, 2021",He looks better as himself

51,"Jun 10, 2021","You had me at Webtoons haha. Great series by the way, makes me look forward to Wednesdays."
51,"Jun 10, 2021","It looks like not only we have to read this entire webtoon, we also must support it"
51,"Jun 10, 2021",50th chapter of webtoon equals 50th chapter in novel. Novel has 650+ chapters. Have fun reading this till it ends TEN YEARS LATER ?!

51,"Jun 9, 2021",#don’tpiratekids
51,"Jun 9, 2021","ah well, I'm broke, so I wait for the episodes to update. "
51,"Jun 9, 2021",I'm pretty certain this chapter is meant to only have 12 readers
51,"Jun 9, 2021",Noooooo I liked the way Dokja looked........Also I feel like the author wanted to show how pirating is annoying  
51,"Jun 9, 2021",I hope once the author ends this series he does a prequel about the origins of this game and the 1st  run. I think it'd be a cool jdea...js
51,"Jun 9, 2021",‘How do you read 50 episodes of that crap. Those people aren’t right in the head’ I feel attacked
51,"Jun 9, 2021",I honestly don’t see a difference in his “new” appearance 😅 maybe it’s his eyebrows?..
51,"Jun 9, 2021",Pls the “Pay for it is you want to read it. Webtoon too” 😭😂
51,"Jun 9, 2021",What if Dokja is “Junghyeok” Cuz Dokja is literally shaping the character of what Junghyeok supposed to be. A Hero.
51,"Jun 9, 2021","[the constellation ""The KAULIANPOWER"" has nothing interesting to say, even when he tried to write something epic for 15 minutes] [(since he has no money) 0 coins have been sponsored.]"

51,"Jun 2, 2021",excited reader has gifted 5 coins to show support for the authors amazing work
51,"May 30, 2021",now i feel good for supporting the author 
51,"May 20, 2021",I totally agree with Dokja and I'm paying for the webtoon even if I have no more coins left.....😭
51,"Apr 22, 2021","Supporting creators is really important. And yes, you should pay for things."
51,"Apr 21, 2021",You wouldn’t download a car...
51,"Apr 21, 2021",We all know anyone here right now does indeed pay for webtoon because we're in too deep to be coasting on freebies lol
51,"Apr 21, 2021",How could those monsters even consider pirating content.
51,"Apr 21, 2021",so good!
51,"Sep 7, 2022",Why does Dokja look way more handsome than Junghyeok to me.......... am I the only one feeling this way!!!!!!!
51,"Feb 24, 2022",ngl Kim Dokja is more handsome and good-looking than Junhyeok Yu. I even started reading this because of KDJ😋
51,"Nov 20, 2021",seeing yjh with many expressions feels so wrong. I've gotten used to his resting bitch face 💀
51,"Nov 7, 2021",It's rare to see Junghyeok Yu face make so many expressions I got used to his annoyed and poker face
51,"Oct 22, 2021",I think Dokja is more handsome than the regressor.
51,"Oct 10, 2021",Listen I'm broke 
51,"Oct 8, 2021",I can't even imagine Yoo Junghyuk smiling like the way Dokja is smiling with his face lol 
51,"Oct 4, 2021","tbh junghyeok in the novel is supposed to be tan, but I guess that would make his face and dokja's mismatch cos of skin tone"
51,"Oct 4, 2021","its funny how episode 50 was the last chapter to drop from +99,999 likes, kinda like how in twsa viewership dropped around the same time.wonder if this'll have 1 reader by the end of it aswell"
51,"Sep 14, 2021","It doesn't sit well with me seeing Junghyeok smile and express feelings, I know it's a mask but I don't dig it especially since I know Dokja's under that mask"
51,"Sep 11, 2021",Dokja's hair with Junghyeok's face. How can one man have so much power
51,"Aug 29, 2021",hahaha I just realized this is episode 50. should I stop reading then🤔 lol

51,"Jun 29, 2021",“You should have read until the end” lol mad flex.  The fact that the other 11 disciples probably don’t even know that there are more than 3000 additional chapters they haven’t read is 🤯
51,"Jun 24, 2021","hi, pirating is wrong. it affects your favourite authors/artists negatively. at least go to the official sites and send likes and good comments "

51,"May 20, 2021",Please the way they also included webtoons is so damn cool. No to piracy. Read legally 🤘

51,"Jan 23, 2022","Right I've only just reached this episode so all this is is to say I said it now. I reckon the ""protagonist/reincarnation,"" knows that our main charecter has read the future and all that other bs. I reckon this is his 3rd or even 5th reincarnation where our main charecter has changed the timeline. My proof: he left the landlord for no reason, the only person who gained from that was our main charecter, unless that's what the ""protagonist"" wanted; there's other things but not enough space for it."
51,"Jan 9, 2022",I like how this is episode 50 and they’re bashing everyone who read past episode 50 of TWSA lol
51,"Dec 19, 2021","""But seriously how do you even read 50 episodes of this crap? Those guys aren't normal LOL"" ,,, me: *eyes the epsiode number im on* ..."

51,"Sep 27, 2021","ok whoa I knew Junghyeok was handsome, but seeing his face on Dokja makes me realize how devilishly handsome he is (or maybe it's bc Dokja's making those shit-eating grins with Junghyeok's face that make it so attractive skdnndk) "
51,"Sep 22, 2021",this just makes me realize how much power he has knowing everything about the novel.
51,"Sep 19, 2021","""you should have read it to the end"", Hell yeah, that's how you beat the haters who shit-talked about your favorite novel."
51,"Sep 14, 2021",the author hinting that we shouldn't read illegally

51,"Jul 7, 2021",Something about Yoo Joonghyuk’s face on Dokja feels weird lmao. But that one part where he looks surprised is pretty legit. He has a stupid sunfish face kekekeke
51,"Jul 7, 2021","I feel like ""pay for it if you want to read it bastards"" was 50% directed towards me..."

51,"Jul 3, 2021","Anyone else think Donghoon and Dokja look a little bit alike or is it just me? No? Well, anyway, I really want them to get close eventually. Poor Donghoon could use a friend. Or found family. By how he acts, he was probably neglected a lot as a kid. He seems to need a friend or two."

51,"Jun 13, 2021",Dokja is my spirit person 😈 He's the main character of the story he's read and he doesn't even realize it... What a humble leader 🤩
51,"Jun 12, 2021",wow it really is bizarre to actually see dokja wearing joonghyuk's face
51,"Jun 12, 2021","That would be my reaction too if I were him, you can't pirate someone else's work to pay you enough how poor are those guys. I'm glad he stay and read the story until the end.... "

51,"Jun 9, 2021",I miss Dokja’s face already and it’s only been gone for a few panels😪
51,"Jun 9, 2021",THAT HEART DROP when I thought the prophets read Dokja's messages though 😳

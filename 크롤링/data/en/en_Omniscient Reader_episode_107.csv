Episode,Date,Review
107,"Jun 1, 2022","I can‚Äôt stop saying this is such a good story, it‚Äôs honestly the only Webtoon that I feel like I have to read as soon as it comes out. Keep it up Author, this is magnificent."
107,"Jun 1, 2022",Every single panel this episode is so beautiful??? from the beginning to end. like Heewon's entrance? POP OFF 
107,"Jun 1, 2022",OMGOMG BEST GIRL HEEWON IS HERE
107,"Jun 1, 2022",Honestly this breaks my heart because she WANTS them to win but she can't do anything about itüò≠Also holy hell Huiwon looks fine af in that suit with the red eyesü•µü•µ
107,"Jun 1, 2022","Dokja: *Does anything* Secretive Plotter: ""Take notes take notes!"" Someone put a spoiler here and refuses to delete it read at your own risk"
107,"Jun 1, 2022",Look at them fighting side-by-side with their matching coats üî•
107,"Jun 1, 2022",Can we just talk about Secretive Plotter taking notes of kdj's decisions haha
107,"Jun 1, 2022",Bruh did she just one shot someone the 2 MC‚Äôs was just struggling with lmao‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt know she was that strong even with the enemy being pure evil buff. I hope this get animated!!!!
107,"Jun 1, 2022","literally one of my favorite plots so far. Dokja wasn't trying to be the protagonist or hero of this scenario. He knew what is needed for the scenario to be completed. one thing I like about this series is how everything is expected and yet unexpected at the same time.
PS. Heewon marry me please ü•∫u already have a suit ü•∫"
107,"Jun 1, 2022","For those who were wondering where the heck Uriel was when the boys were dying in each other‚Äôs arms, calling each other companions and hosting a soap opera‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs your answer lmao Uriel and Huiwon coming in clutch"
107,"Jun 1, 2022","penalty for failure: destruction of Seoul. Man, I don't know.... That battle looks like it did just that anyways üòÇ"
107,"Jun 1, 2022",HEEWON THIS IS ME PROPOSING 
107,"Jun 1, 2022","It's tragic, because she asked Dokja to kill her and wants their world to survive. I hope she doesn't have to die, clearing the scenario just said the Catastrophe has to be *defeated*, not necessarily that the Catastrophe must be killed. T_T"
107,"Jun 1, 2022",anyone else have an unfathomable amount of hatred for that one Dokabi?
107,"Jun 1, 2022","Huiwon in a suit, hot DAMN. God I've missed this badass woman. "
107,"Jun 1, 2022",INSTANT GOOSEBUMPS WHEN HUIWON APPEARED. omg I love her new look so badass.
107,"Jun 1, 2022",Dokja‚Äôs OC is the coolest female in this series rn
107,"Jun 1, 2022","Huiwon is hereee! Honestly, she's so cool. Uriel and Huiwon are the best!! "
107,"Jun 1, 2022","[Constellation Dragon of the Peach Tree is pleased by the appearance of our judge of evil, but sad to see adult Shin about to perish.]"
107,"Jun 1, 2022","From Yuseung saying it‚Äôs ok to kill her, to how absolutely bad@ss Huiwon has become this is beyond amazing. Also, that‚Äôs level 1 for the Flames of Hell?!?!"
107,"Jul 6, 2022","IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT DOKJA'S MONOLOGUE ABT THE CONSTELLATIONS?????
""Go wild and run your mouths off all you want, until the day... I come to pluck out your tongues.""

LIKE??? IT REMINDS ME OF THIS ICONIC LINE [[[SPOILERS]]]

107,"Jul 6, 2022",secretive plotter fr been here since day one
107,"Jul 6, 2022","Hey ICE FISH. I think you may think that talking about the novel to webtoon readers is fun, but it's really just annoying. They never asked to be spoiled. You're ruining their experience of the story. I want people to read the novel as well, but spoiling the story isn't going to help do that."
107,"Jul 6, 2022",Yuseung: you can't defeat me Dokja: I can't but *she* can *Huiwon'# great entrance*
107,"Jul 6, 2022",Hey guys there's this person called ICEFISH in the comments section spoiling the entire story. Pls report their comments so that they get deleted 
107,"Jul 6, 2022","it makes perfect sense that it's Huiwon. The author set this up a long time ago. Huiwon was already powerful since the beginning and her sense of justice was great. Given how much everyone else grew away from MC, it made sense that Huiwon would reach the top pinnacle of power. Great job on the author for setting this up since the beginning rather than the typical ass pulled so many failed writers have done. "
107,"Jun 2, 2022","And once again, his comrades got stronger by NOT being with him, lmao"
107,"Jun 1, 2022",this was badass 
107,"Jun 30, 2022",*Dokja making a good plan and decision*Secretive Plotter: Let me write this down!
107,"Jul 6, 2022",this ICE FISH person needs to stop putting spoilers under every damn comment. I'm so annoyed. even though I have read the novel I would never spoil it for others just for fun. and now I'm really pissed off by this ICE FISH. so please be aware of them and report their comments. 
107,"Jul 6, 2022","it feels very hollow and bitter, this ""fight"" or ""win"" nobody feels happy about defeating an enemy that surrendered and then was forced against their will to fight "
107,"Jul 6, 2022",There‚Äôs an INCREDIBLE animatic about this fight by icyroses on YouTube! It‚Äôs called Befall and it‚Äôs so SO BEAUTIFUL!!! 
107,"Jul 6, 2022",that panel where there's kdj and yjh fighting side by side is DAAMNNNN HOOOOTTTT

107,"Jul 6, 2022",she's so hot bro
107,"Jul 6, 2022",NAT ICE FISH IS HERE. THEY'VE INFECTED THE NEW COMMENTS
107,"Jul 6, 2022","ORV is not a ""one man"" show. Supporting characters play significant role.‚ù§üíúOne of the things i love about this series (besides artwork & captivating story)"
107,"Jul 6, 2022","These last few episodes are really setting up the constellations in general as the true final boss to be defeated by showing to what extent they're willing to go for entertainment, they forced the heroes to kill a defeated villain just to have their little show. Really meta when you consider that the constellations ultimately are a stand in for the audience, so I guess we're the real bad guys of the story because we're watching how the characters suffer for the sake of our entertainment. "
107,"Jul 6, 2022","Ps. To all the Novel readers here. Please refrain from spoiling others and also report the one who have a nickname ""ICE FISH"" because they keep spoiling other readers."
107,"Jul 6, 2022",i‚Äôm GAY i‚Äôm GAY i‚Äôm GAY im GAY i can‚Äôt even finish the episode i‚Äôm stuck zooming in on every huiwon panel she is STUNNING!!

107,"Jun 22, 2022","1. I hope this story gets animated because it deserves it. More people need to know about this series and how great it is.2. Huiwon, ma'am, I'm feeling things for you"
107,"Jun 8, 2022",also power couple with dokja and junghyeok fighting the catastrophe 
107,"Jun 7, 2022",This wasn't one of the highest rated webtoons for no reason- never regretted spending my coins on this 
107,"Jun 2, 2022","I started reading omniscient reader just a few days ago it's so addictive I couldn't put my phone down I can't wait for the next chapter, kind of feel like a constellation always at the edge of my seat with each chapter. to the authors thank you for your hard work and sharing this masterpiece."
107,"Jul 6, 2022","not gonna lie, those first couple panels of Huiwon showing up had my mind completely blank except for the word HOT on repeat"

107,"Jul 6, 2022",ICE FISH. Could you delete your spoiler replies? There isn't any reason to keep them up. You have a lot under many comments. People hate you for that. Please do so before greater consequences occur. You could have your account deleted. You'd lose all your comments if that happens.
107,"Jul 6, 2022",jung Heewon's entrance.. SO FUCKIN EPIC!

107,"Jun 24, 2022",is it getting hot here? or is it just heewon ü•µü•µ
107,"Jun 1, 2022",Amazing.  I just started this half a week ago and I couldn't put it down.  [Donates 25 coins to catch up]
107,"Jul 6, 2022","I can't even praise this manwha,  the goosebumps i get while reading every chapter is priceless üò´"
107,"Jul 6, 2022",I admit I fangirled for a moment when best woman Huiwon got here but... This whole chapter felt so sad and distressing... I hate every second of this fight and I feel like is a turning point for Dokja. That from now on he will get harder on his path of survival. 
107,"Jul 6, 2022",that was so cool
107,"Jul 6, 2022","I love it. I love the fact that it's not Dokja beating every BBEG in every scenario and that he had to utilize his allies' abilities in the fight. It makes him look like a leader instead of just a protagonist unlike luffy or goku. to compare, he's like Kazuma but less stupid"
107,"Jul 6, 2022",I don‚Äôt know why but I felt disgust when he got 15k coins.
107,"Jul 6, 2022",OMFG FINALLY HUIWON YOU'RE HERE
107,"Jul 6, 2022","So basically, at the moment, Huiwon is stronger than the protagonist of TWSA. That's dope. Finally another powerful female character."

107,"Jul 6, 2022",I‚Äôm not gonna lie i totally forgot about heewon üò¨ but she looks great and that was one bada** entrance
107,"Jun 29, 2022","I just KNOW that the constellation Secretive plotter is gonna blow everyone‚Äôs minds one day. My theory is that Dokja will choose it as his constellation or it does something extreme, or becomes something extreme. Maybe it exposes Dokja? I have no idea but I bet I‚Äôm right"
107,"Jul 6, 2022","THE QUEEN HAS ARRIVED, FEAR HER WRATH"
107,"Jul 17, 2022",I love how the main character doesn't dwarf everyone in power and still seems vulnerable with all that plot armor

18,"Oct 7, 2020",“You’re not yourself when your hungry have a snickers”
18,"Oct 7, 2020",I got a scenario for ya. Let’s see how long you last. New Scenario: Your face meets Dokja’s fist. 
18,"Oct 7, 2020",Look at our Dokja being so inspiring and bringing Hyeonseong to tears 😂
18,"Oct 7, 2020","the constellations are gonna love this one, you can't manipulate someone who knows they are being manipulated, how easy would it be to show the woman was left for dead after being raped and attacked. true by saying this he would gain more followers he doesn't want or need and put them in danger for going against their current leader but their current leader is gonna get them killed anyway. time to open some minds"
18,"Oct 7, 2020","Ah yes, the schemer type. Inho's death will be particularly satisfying. "
18,"Oct 7, 2020",Am I the only one who thinks that the four of them look like a family when their sitting there with their food🥺 
18,"Oct 21, 2020",I hope the little kid with the bugs in the beggining always stays with Dokja. I feel like the kid looks up to him and the way he ran up and hugged Dokja... I just want them to stay together.

18,"Oct 21, 2020",[The Ugliest King is getting major “sus vibes” from the incarnation ‘Inho Cheon’] [The Ugliest King does not like the incarnation ‘Inho Cheon’] [The Ugliest King can’t wait for the opportunity to kick the incarnation ‘Inho Cheon’s ass]
18,"Oct 7, 2020",I love how the author really plays with human tendency and forces Dokja Kim to think outside of the story's main plot and focus on the background. 
18,"Oct 21, 2020",Why is no one ever talking ab my boy gilyeong lee?? When he ran to go hug Dokja when he found out he wasn't dead ugh 😌💕
18,"Oct 8, 2020","dang. I've never felt this invested in a story before..! despite having free coins, I never used them. until now. I even bought more, just to get to the last update. I feel.. fulfilled? but also.. regret? IMPATIENT lol. guess I should go read the novel 👁️👄👁️"
18,"Oct 21, 2020","While I understand where all the shouting people are coming from, (having been thrown into such a hopeless situation) it really annoys me how easily they hop on the bandwagon and turn against a guy who clearly is doing nothing wrong. Dokja isn't being selfish because he doesn't owe these people anything, yet here they are acting like he should just give them everything he has."
18,"Oct 7, 2020",WTFF DOKJA IS SO AMAZING 😍 
18,"Oct 7, 2020",Bro I need more episodes this isn’t enough this story is like a drug and I need my fix 
18,"Oct 7, 2020",this is why I don’t have siblings.
18,"Oct 20, 2020","Okay, but I'm getting scared since the translation team doesn't seem to like to use korean honorifics(?) like the ""-ssi"" which bothered me a lot along with the name translation. I get the feeling that they wouldn't use ""hyung"" either and I am extremely bothered by that. PLEASE PLEASE DON'T ROB US OFF OF OUR CUTE RESPECTFUL GILYOUNG. Because Lee Gilyoung(and the other kids) calling Kim Dokja by the name just doesn't sit right with me. NO F-CKING WAY"
18,"Oct 19, 2020",Funny how we all got 5 coins and immediately used them on the next episode. 
18,"Oct 21, 2020",The way the child ran up and hugged Dokja at the beginning was adorable!!! I swear to god everyone must protect this child!!!😟❤

18,"Oct 8, 2020",More!!! I want More!!! Where is another charpter??? We want MORE!!! 
18,"Oct 22, 2020",I love how the author doesnt make Dokja a completely selfless being. He has a sense of justice but decides when to act on it. He avenged the girl who was attacked but wont share food to help the ppl at the station. Its an interesting duality. He’s not a hero in that he’s not always going to do the right thing
18,"Oct 21, 2020",Aw the little kid sprinted to hug him 🤧
18,"Oct 21, 2020",When the little boy hugged him 🥺❤️
18,"Oct 21, 2020",is it just me or is dokja lowkey getting more handsome
18,"Oct 21, 2020",Inho means in finnish Disgust :') 
18,"Oct 21, 2020",I wonder if the people that worked at pet shops became overpowered during the first scenario...
18,"Oct 21, 2020",the cutest thing was the lil boy going to hug him 😭
18,"Oct 21, 2020",if i ever was in omniscient reader i would definitely be the first to die or i would go crazy because finally reality isnt as boring as i thought 
18,"Oct 21, 2020","From the moment I first saw him, that smile defines the word “sus”"
18,"Nov 2, 2020",I'm not gay but Dokja is kinda hot tho.
18,"Oct 21, 2020",the boy running up to dokja and hugging him!! 😭😢💖💞
18,"Oct 21, 2020",i hate the dude in the striped suit SO MUCH
18,"Oct 21, 2020",Looking at Kim Dokja and Lee Hyeonseong standing together Dokja looks small... 
18,"Oct 21, 2020",dokja in black hits different 😳
18,"Oct 21, 2020","[The constellation, Secretive Plotter, is pleased that you are talking out loud.] Exqueeze me?"
18,"Oct 21, 2020",Damn all these people need a snickers 
18,"Oct 21, 2020","I went out, I got the food, my right for it. I didn’t even know any of you existed a hour ago. If you want your food then you can go out there and get your share like I did."
18,"Dec 11, 2020","I usually hate children in manwha/manga, but Gilyeong is just TOO FREAKING CUTE!! T_T"
18,"Oct 21, 2020",The way the little boy hugged Dokja Kim when they reunited 😭🥺
18,"Oct 21, 2020",I love that kid at dojkas side like he's so wholesome 
18,"Oct 8, 2020",I did it again 😫 When the series were just released I bought all fast passes. Then waited for 1.5 month until I can read it for free again. And when this day finally came...... I bought all the available fast passes again 😱 HELP!
18,"Apr 28, 2021",So that baby killed someone too?
18,"Feb 26, 2021",I’m picturing all the constellations right now in their pajamas eating popcorn while watching this.
18,"Oct 22, 2020","junhyeok yu: *pushes Dokja into the maw of a sea serpent*also junhyeok: meh hes probably fine
ALSO THE CHILD IS SO PRECIOUS THE WAY HE RUNS TO DOKJA AWWWWW"
18,"Oct 21, 2020","I can't get enough of this series, the way it looks at human nature once you drop the social conventions and masks. No one playing nice or being polite or pretending anymore. Everyone giving in to the most base of desires. The hypocrisy, the selfishness, the cruelty. No cutesy adorable heroine or hero in white shining armor. Just humans. "
18,"Oct 7, 2020","I mean I feel bad for Dokja but he shouldve known better, after all if you brought food into a group of hungry people tensions are bound to rise."
18,"Apr 26, 2021","I mean, I know they're starving and shit, but, Dokja was the one who got the food while everyone else stayed down there on their asses because of fear. He was OUT THERE. He got it all. And he saved someone. Like... if you want food, earn it. I know I'd probably be asking for food too, but in a situation like that. Asking won't do you much. You have to get it."
18,"Oct 21, 2020",when that kid went and hugged Dokja? That stuff was wholesome
18,"Oct 21, 2020",I love how the little kid was the first one to hug Dokja. (I really hope he doesn't die)
18,"Oct 21, 2020","Fun fact:Hunger influences your brain’s decisions and tends to make you more aggressive or to start a fight. If you feel angry or more aggressive than usual and you know you’re hungry, have a Snicker. That’ll help. "
18,"Oct 19, 2020",I used my event coins but it was worth it
18,"Apr 26, 2021",I'm not even watching this for the coins anymore but it makes me anxious but a good type that makes me want to read more
18,"Jan 28, 2021",Dokja: :rapidly throws snickers bars at everyone:  YALL NEED SOME SNICKERS
18,"Dec 24, 2020",Um... We all just gonna ignore that a baby survived the first scinario? DID THAT BABY KILL SOMEONE?!?!? 
18,"Nov 6, 2020",I love the secret plotter constellation .....he is a m.o.o.d
18,"Oct 22, 2020",that army guy is so cute 🥺
18,"Oct 21, 2020",I wonder ; first senario was killing living organisms. What if you get antibacterial wipes and clean around? Bacteria dies. Would it counts as success?
18,"Oct 21, 2020",Ah back to our regularly scheduled programming.
18,"Oct 21, 2020",secretive plotter is happy he didnt plot secretively? lol

18,"Oct 18, 2020",Hyeongseong is fully of Big Baby energy. Oh those puppy eyes he gave to Dokja.😭
18,"Apr 29, 2021",“Dokja...you’re pretty cool.” DUDE HE KILLED A FRICKIN SEA MONSTER WITH SPIKES AND SNOT. HE’S A LOT MORE THAN JUST COOL.

18,"Mar 23, 2021",leave my dude Dokja alone bro
18,"Feb 23, 2021",I love that Dokja immediately gave Gilyoung food (right after the adorable hug 🥰)
18,"Feb 7, 2021","It’s always the ones with the closed eyes,😔it happened in bleach and now it INFECTED webtoon"
18,"Feb 5, 2021",omg my baby gilyoung is so such a cutie did y'all see how he run towards dokja and when he's receiving a food from dokja omg my heart i wanna be a sponsor to T^T
18,"Oct 22, 2020",This needs to become an anime right now. I'll even donate to a Kickstarter.
18,"Oct 21, 2020",Gilyoung Hugging Dokja is really cute. Dokja really became like an older brother figure to him :) 
18,"Oct 21, 2020",This is actually the real map for metros in Korea

18,"Oct 21, 2020","Ok, now I wanna know who the Secretive Plotter really is! (although I have a feeling that’d be a major story spoiler 😅)"
18,"Oct 21, 2020",""" I heard you are monopolizing the food for yourself."" 
Me Passing out food: "" is that so?"""
18,"Oct 21, 2020","I really, really hope that blondie isn't a love interest. I love the main story without all the romance side stuff, you know? It would be disappointing."

18,"Oct 7, 2020",Can’t wait for Jung-Hyeok’s reappearance!!! Love the series so much ❤️❤️
18,"Oct 27, 2020",looks like most of you dont know this is based on a web novel ☹️ it will take like 3 years or more for us to see the end of the webtoon so i recommend reading web novel! i also started reading web novel when 3 webtoon eps were released i think? pls go read it its so good
18,"Apr 28, 2021",When the kid rushes up and hugs him T-T so good

18,"Nov 1, 2020",they just had a bromance moment. I'm loving this 
18,"Oct 28, 2020","In an instant if we were all in an apocalypse we would become a hypocrite. When those people were complaining, I just said “why not get it yourself”, I bet that they would have done the same and not shared. It’s every person for themselves as rude as it may sound. Folks worked hard to get those food and if he was able to get food why can’t they, complaining won’t do anything so you must take action. Sorry if that sounded really harsh...."
18,"Oct 26, 2020",Despair huh? Let me tell you what is despair. The moment you see 7 chapters in the fast pass but you can't buy coins to unlock them and thus you have to stop at such a crucial point of the story......THIS IS DESPAIR.
18,"Oct 22, 2020",I’m loving this webtoon I’m just too broke to read it(● ˃̶͈̀ロ˂̶͈́)੭ꠥ⁾⁾
18,"Oct 22, 2020",My favorite thing about this ep is hyeonseong blush towards dokja and gildong's ( the kid ) reaction towards dokja's arrival. Dokja even dropped him a chocolate bar.
18,"Oct 22, 2020",I would love to punch that blonde guy
18,"Oct 21, 2020",Hyeonseong Is cute tho he has a big body with a big heart reminds me of Asahi from Haikyuu. Just look at DOKJA standing beside him he's Gigantic 😂
18,"Oct 21, 2020",What if the secretive plotter was the author of TWSA? 🤔
18,"Oct 21, 2020","The cute little kid running to Dokja was the most adorable thing ever! Yup no doubt about, the chibi is my favorite character."

18,"Oct 21, 2020","Looks like Omniscient Reader is back to uploading once a week, getting to read it every day (without coins) was nice while it lasted"
18,"Oct 20, 2020",Damn. Didn’t realize this episode was being released for free tomorrow. Should have saved the free coins for the following episode. 
18,"Feb 21, 2021","Woah Dokja finally reunited with his team, that's awesome. Inho cheon huh, it's another enemy. Why is the secretive plotter too excited? There's a lot of hungry people there and there's a smiling villain, this is awesome."
18,"Oct 26, 2020","I put off reading this webtoon until recently when there was a fast pass/coin event, but I was hooked from the first episode. I didn’t think it would be good because there have been many sci-fi apocalyptic type stories, but the author’s creativity is astonishing. Keep up with the good work!"
18,"Oct 22, 2020",This Inho Cheon guy needs to go down

18,"Oct 21, 2020","its a bit awkward reading junghyuk yu instead of yu junghyuk... it doesn't flow very well. i know they switched it around for the name to be first, but I'd like to assume people generally know that in other countries its last name first, then your given name. 😅 just doesnt flow well"
18,"Oct 21, 2020","Hell no don’t share your food. It’s HIS food that HE got HIMSELF. Tell them to go get their own food. It may sound heartless, but it’s what you need to do if you want to survive"
18,"Jan 13, 2021","the secretive plotter doesn't like when others secretively plotting something, the irony..."

Some people thinking they shouldnt be thinking about rights things or try to do right things because they believe they are a bad person.

18,"Oct 8, 2020","So, when this novel was adapted to a webtoon, I started to read the actual novel. I have finally finished reading it. And let me just say, I find that it gets really confusing. It wont really get too confusing any time soon. But I'd say in the last 3rd of the novel, I was getting really confused. It also got a little slow after the 10th, but picked up again not too long afterwards."
18,"Oct 8, 2020",I can totally imagine this as an anime. The plot is new and interesting in it's own way. The comments about what the constellations feel and do also make it rlly funny. It's the most interesting read I had in a long time. Give it a chance guys! 
18,"Oct 8, 2020",I... I ship our reader protag...... with the lieutenant 👀
18,"Oct 8, 2020","...In that situation, I would have hid as much as the food as I could on my person and made my friends do the same. The rest of the food we would have thrown at everyone else and said have a good day, we already ate. Immediately leave. Cause unless I have known everyone in a group for awhile, there is no trust. "

18,"Feb 3, 2022",I just realized why the first scenario was to kill one organism. it was because most people immediately jump to a person when it comes to an organism and once a human has broken their morals ones they are very willing to do it again. if you were to kill someone today it would be a lot easier to kill someone tomorrow morally for you

18,"May 28, 2022","I have to wonder how many people sacrificed themselves, allowing others to kill them, during the first senerio "

18,"Apr 14, 2022","What's funny is they jump on him about monopolizing food like that, basically using moral standards of 'where's your humanity? everyone here needs to survive too!' when they're only alive right now because they ended another's life for their own."
18,"Apr 14, 2022","It's interesting because dokja actually feels omniscient. He doesn't seem all morally right but doesn't seem too morally wrong either. Although, in this scenario I guess morals don't matter too much "

18,"Oct 21, 2020","Inho is betting on Dokja's charity. There's a lot I want to contemplate about in tis situation, but saying anymore than this might be spoilers so I should shut up. "
18,"Oct 21, 2020",and here I thought Cheon Inho was a freaking fatass belly monster hahahahahaha
18,"Oct 21, 2020","this webtoon is kinda reminding me of rebirth, cuz they're all in an apocalypse. dokja reminds me of noah(also rebirth) cuz people look up to them."
18,"Oct 21, 2020","In the webnovel, the waifu name was Jung Heewon. Here she was name Huiwon. I guess it is the same person."
18,"Oct 21, 2020",you can read this for free at asurascans and its like ten chapters ahead of this
18,"Oct 21, 2020",I have decided to buy coins for the first time ever after having WEBTOON for 2 years because of this novel. What is it about his book????
18,"Oct 21, 2020","JUNGYEOK YU????? OK I don’t know about y’all but they are literally getting almost everything from the LN wrong. I don’t think imma read this here anymore. The amount of mistranslation compared to Ashura Scans is appalling.
Edit: Ok so apparently there is a different way of saying the name as there are different Korean writing between Hangul and Hanja but either way there is still a bunch of other mistranslations in this like Broken faith or Returner "
18,"Oct 21, 2020",Humans are scary
18,"Oct 9, 2020","is this series being translated by webtoon? do they own the rights? saw this series translated by fans somewhere else, that's why."
18,"Mar 15, 2021",haha im sorry if this comment doesnt fit the webtoon genre but damnn dokja hawt hottt🥵

18,"Apr 29, 2021","bruh, he went through all this chaos to take food and y'all just being lazy bums waiting for someone to feed ya like a pet waiting for the owners to feed em. They still have the audacity for scolding this man hogging all the food to himself and his pals. nani???"
18,"Oct 22, 2020","I'm a bit confused, did the second scenario happened that quickly...? What about... The food and that dokkaebi...? Also, I loved how they portrayed their interactions"
18,"Oct 21, 2020","Ok, I reaaaaly want one more episode, i'm gonna try using a fast pass... *checks wallet* ehmmm.... maybe next time hehe 😅"

18,"Oct 21, 2020",Can't wait for the King scenario to began and everyone start calling and thinking about how Dokja's ugly compared to Junghyuk LMAO
18,"Oct 21, 2020",Calling it right now the kid becomes the new antagonist 
18,"Oct 21, 2020",Huh. It almost looked like Yu Junghyeok was wearing a white coat. Neat.

18,"Oct 20, 2020",this is y humans are imbeciles
18,"Oct 20, 2020",I ship Lee and dokja so hard right now
18,"Oct 20, 2020",Figured I’d use my free coins to support the webtoon now rather than having to wait twice as long for a new update if I spend them on the next episode. The coin system really doesn’t courage supporting your fav webtoons unless you can afford to keep paying for them 😅
18,"Oct 20, 2020",Noooo..... I've read everything. What is is fast pass and how do I use it? 😂
18,"Oct 20, 2020",You see Gilyoung sprinting when he saw Dokja...he almost killed me 😖 My heart legit did a somersault. 
18,"Oct 7, 2020",I’m just spending my coins to see if I can get a top comment lol😭 my life is terrible
18,"Oct 7, 2020",I'm here early
18,"Jun 16, 2022",Female: are you monopolizing food?!Chad: Yes 
18,"Nov 11, 2021","Dokja is probably going to turn the crowd into his favor, after all he has the biggest weapons up his sleeve... the fact that he read TWSA.  "
18,"May 2, 2021",Inho Cheon?!  is he Lisa Cheon's brother??????? 
18,"Oct 30, 2020",why wouldn't  they keep up with other sites or app that have omniscient reader?  
18,"Oct 22, 2020",Does anyone want a spoiler
18,"Oct 22, 2020",0mmmmm thay0 doood ugly ew 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤧🤧😩
18,"Oct 21, 2020",I'm broke😥
18,"Oct 21, 2020",BRUH.... WHY DOKJA LOOKED HIGH AF WHEN HE LOOKED AT INHO
18,"Oct 21, 2020",New scenario: Fight Dokja. See who wins. If Dokja wins then u probably ded. If u win u probably ded. :D best one yet 
18,"Oct 25, 2020",Its so similar to solo leveling... hm. do you guys know the comic solo leveling?
18,"Oct 22, 2020","I'm sorry but how can you consider the site that has the full story uploaded as illegal? cause the author first uploaded the story as a novel on the other site from almost 2018 and then later decided to make a comic version of it (aka this comic). so, the other site where the story is completed isn't illegal 😑"
18,"Oct 21, 2020",why does it feel like solo leveling
18,"Nov 27, 2020",Ahh this version of the WEBTOON uses the same names A_Passing_Wanderer used in the second half of the novel blegh hate jungheok yoo it’s Yu Jonghyuk 
18,"Nov 17, 2020",Dokja look just like Sung Jin-Woo from Solo leveling  :) 
18,"Oct 24, 2020","y'all should try super manga... it's available on Google as apk...there r like 7 ,8 more episodes and that even for free!"
18,"Oct 21, 2020",I will give you a hint. One of these people on station is going to give birth in future. Guess who it is gonna be🤭
18,"Oct 22, 2020","this is kinda funny because he seems to know everything but at the same time, he doesn't seem to know what's happening or how to react, and he need to improvise.. So does he know just the ""big things"" in the story, and kinda forgot all the minor details? or he knows it all?XD  Omniscent means that he should know it all though ..."
18,"May 3, 2022","honest to god, in all of these situations, KILL EVERYONE, is my first thought, kind of annoying that he is avoiding that,."
18,"Oct 24, 2020",or just kill them all >///<

21,"Mar 29, 2021","Woah Sangah be speaking in demonic language like a pro. Oh gosh Mr. Han just got tentacled in the mouth, this is so funny no context omg. Wow where did Dokja get that super skill? And how did he got enough points to buy that in the first place? Deym he finally showed his OP powers. Pretty impressive."

I tell him that it was just a webtoon but he did't care he know thinks that I read gay porn so... yeah
21,"Jan 6, 2021","I totally understand why the constellations watch this. This is quality entertainment. Dokja is practically underestimating himself. He's always like ""i'm just a normal reader"" while he's so damn cool"
21,"Dec 17, 2020",man i rlly wanted myungoh to die by tentacle that wldve been appropriate for him :/

21,"May 1, 2021","Just confirming, we already are all simps for Dokja, right? "
21,"Apr 28, 2021",Tbh I think han deserved the dick to his mouth. Maybe having demon kids will teach him some responsibility and maturity... ot it’ll kill him but that’s fine with me too 
21,"Apr 27, 2021",What in the Tentacle hentai is goin on here!?!!! 
21,"Apr 26, 2021",DAYUMM.IS THAT DEEPTHROATING I SEE😳😩🍆💦

21,"Feb 3, 2021",am i reading a webtoon or watching tentacle hentai?
21,"Jan 16, 2021",Some real hentai shit right there
21,"Jan 6, 2021",My mind drifted to dangerous places with the tentacle in mouth 😥
21,"Dec 26, 2020",never thought I'd see mpreg in this
21,"Dec 17, 2020","Bruh I get MAD Kirito Vibes from him (Kirito is the main character in Sword Art Online who is stuck in a VR game and he was a beta tester for the game and if you die in the game you die irl, so he became a swordsman)"
21,"Dec 15, 2020",I read a lot and take self-defense classes yet I still could never do that. (hint of jealousy)
21,"Dec 9, 2020",This why teachers keep on telling us to read a lot. Reading a lot can save our ass. HAAHAHHAHAHAHHA
21,"Nov 30, 2020",First of all can we all take a brief moment to appreciate the art. 😲😲😲
21,"Nov 29, 2020",The tentacle freaks are smirking in the corner
21,"Nov 29, 2020",tentacle hentai never thought id see that here 😏
21,"Nov 28, 2020",Lmao I was wondering how they'd illustrate this scene
21,"Nov 25, 2020",and so the omegaverse was born in this world.
21,"Nov 25, 2020","Ugh... that reminded me of that gross Alien scene with the impregnation. I feel very sick. On the flip side, props to Dokja for whooping its ass!!!"
21,"Nov 25, 2020",So it wasn't dirty of me to laugh when I saw those tantacles. And when that warden of death tried to impregnate myeongoh it sure reminded me of that one particular Gintama Doujinshi xD
21,"Nov 22, 2020",This really deserves an anime 💯👌
21,"Nov 22, 2020",I love how the author drops easter eggs in previous chapters that become essential elements in future episodes. Its great story building. & its crazy how I said in the comments last chapter that myeong oh can choke..and well he did lol
21,"Nov 20, 2020",I think myeongoh's purpose in this story is to experience all the sufferings hahahahahaha
21,"Nov 20, 2020",I’ve seen enough hentai to know where this is going
21,"Nov 20, 2020",never would I have thought I would find tentacle porn on webtoon 😭
21,"Nov 20, 2020",this some tenta p*rn shit XD

21,"Nov 18, 2020","The poor Dokkaebis, they no longer have control over their own channel. Its Dokja's property from now on."
21,"Nov 18, 2020","Yow, that line: ""You just... have to read a lot."" That's cool! Hahaha, it makes me wanna study more!"
21,"Nov 18, 2020",I need to thank my past self for reading tons of books.
21,"Nov 18, 2020",Dokja is my new idol. i had to go back and reread those last few panels because it was just too badass for my puny mortal mind to comprehend
21,"Nov 18, 2020",I've read/watched enough 😎 to know where this is going
21,"Nov 18, 2020",There should be a warning on this chapter 
21,"Nov 18, 2020",dayum the constellations got no mercy
21,"Nov 18, 2020",Every time I see Dokja do anything I run laps around my room his fighting is so hype
21,"Nov 18, 2020",Damn. This would a really good anime.
21,"Nov 18, 2020","Remember kids, reading may save your life"
21,"Nov 18, 2020","""you just need to read a lot"" am I OP now?"

21,"Jul 30, 2021",I think I indirectly watched a H3ntai with mpreg ;)
21,"Aug 3, 2022",Not Mynungoh being fucked in the mouth by a demonic species
21,"Aug 2, 2022",oh my god he just got mpreg'd
21,"Nov 11, 2021",EVERY PANELS WAS SO GOOD 
21,"Oct 30, 2021","damn, thought for a second there i missed the mpreg tag before i started reading this"
21,"Sep 12, 2021",watched enough hentai to guess where this was going
21,"Sep 1, 2021","Ngl, my jaw just dropped as i saw the panel where the tentacle just plunged into his mouth bc DAMN. Ik we dont like Mr. Han but few deserve THAT, sheesh"
21,"Aug 13, 2021",A reader must fight like a reader.U mean commenting? 
21,"Jun 2, 2021",I see the author is a little kinky
21,"May 15, 2021","Books. Books are how humans upgrade their hard drive, RAM, and CPU. "
21,"May 3, 2021",This is some hentai crap 😂
21,"May 2, 2021","I have seen enough hentai to know what happens next..next thing he knew, Han Myungoh was pregaganant 🤰"
21,"May 1, 2021",Dokja makes being a bookworm so hot 😍😍
21,"May 1, 2021",the dokkaebi look so cute and fluffy for being such wicked little beasties
21,"Apr 29, 2021",“You just have to read a lot.” *Quack noise* Bruh that’s literally like all I do. WAIT DON’T TELL ME THAT IN READING THIS SERIES...I’M GONNA BRING ON THE APOCALYPSE AND SLAUGHTER MONSTERS?!? 
21,"Apr 29, 2021",Maybe I should've kept up my Duolingo....
21,"Apr 29, 2021",I'm just happy the tentacles stayed away from the female this time.
21,"Apr 28, 2021","Ahh, tentacle hentai rape. Classic "

21,"Apr 27, 2021",This WEBTOON makes me feel better about spending all my free time reading. 
21,"Apr 27, 2021","i just wanna commend dokja's decision in buying that broken faith, even the dokkaebi doubted and questioned him for that i mean it's understandable bc why would u rather buy a 'broken' sword when u can just buy a more powerful weapon instead but look at how he managed to use that against a powerful opponent. it's like the same as saying ""you're broken but that doesn't mean you're worthless"". just 3am thoughts. "
21,"Apr 27, 2021",i just started reading this and I am completely obsessed. I should be doing hw rn but I rather spend my day reading this. 
21,"Apr 26, 2021",I'm starting to feel like this comic was made especially for those of us who read and think we're useless in the real world 
21,"Apr 26, 2021",Am I the only one who thinks Dokja’s kinda cute?
21,"Apr 15, 2021","I got emotional when he said ""you need to read a lot"", reading manhwas and or mangas at some I thought it's useless but this is my life and always love reading it."
21,"Apr 13, 2021",holy shit dokja just went off that fight was epic
21,"Apr 11, 2021",Soooo has he been impregnated or not....?
21,"Mar 11, 2021",I love the fact that fooken SUN WUKONG and the DEMONIC JUDGE OF FIRE were pestering that’s little demon because they wanted to see a monster get destroyed.
21,"Mar 2, 2021",see kids? reading is good for you
21,"Mar 2, 2021",I’ve seen enough hentia to know were this is going
21,"Feb 25, 2021",AND THIS DOOD STILL THINKS HE AINT THE PROTAGONIST
21,"Feb 22, 2021",when webtoons turn into hentai the first step= tentacle skeleton.

21,"Feb 17, 2021",she can speak demon? 0-0
21,"Feb 11, 2021",That tentacle sucking was.... interesting...
21,"Jan 5, 2021",This guy is sick. Man!!!. I'm totally impressed he is such a well written character. He isn't an angel but he isn't quite evil. His character is just in balance

21,"Dec 8, 2020",The life long lesson of this webtoon is... REAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
21,"Dec 6, 2020",I don't like fried octopus anymore
21,"Dec 4, 2020",thank god real girls can't get pregnant like this 😂😂

21,"Nov 25, 2020",um so after i saw that ‘part’ i quickly went to comment section to see what readers have to say abt it 😬
21,"Nov 25, 2020",man this would make one juicy anime 
21,"Nov 25, 2020",if he's supposed to be average looking now whats he gonna look like in the future??? also I guess its not called unbroken faith anymore
21,"Nov 23, 2020", I am not regretting reading this webtoon. the art itself is a truly fantastic masterpiece. waiting for this webtoon to be animated soon.
21,"Nov 22, 2020",I should be a freakin prophet if that last line is to be believed.
21,"Nov 22, 2020",So umm... demons are hentai monsters?
21,"Nov 21, 2020",guys i've finished the web novel just yesterday. best thing i've ever read. yall should read it too
21,"Nov 21, 2020","I don't know why but I like the end of the world stories. I just find it interesting and chilling at the same time. I like the concept of it I guess. what would happen to man kind? how would we survive? will the world ever be the same? I just love to see what happens to the characters and how the author takes on that situation. Micro hunter, sweet home, rebirth, pararelle city, this, and many more shows and stories. that's just how I feel. like if you like these of stories as well."
21,"Nov 21, 2020"," Theory since his skill is about reading maybe that's his future self telling him at the Exact time this will happen,his skill is about reading but what if he gets a skill about Writing a book,and to bookmark the past of his ""Story""."
21,"Nov 21, 2020",Dokja is so fvcking cool *gives hand in marriage*
21,"Nov 21, 2020",in order to survive to an apocalypse is to read a lot and yeah thats why im here
21,"Nov 21, 2020",HAHAHAH omg I only remember Myungoh's fatherly side later on but I totally forgot when he was impregnated. Seeing the scene drawn out is kinda funny 😂
21,"Nov 20, 2020",So many other episodes have CWs for violence but apparently tentacle p*rn doesn’t need a CW these days 😂 🐙 🙈
21,"Nov 20, 2020","Myeongeoh is pregnant , he cant pass on to the next scenario before giving birth."
21,"Nov 20, 2020",Who would guess that being a single mom would be the best thing for him
21,"Nov 20, 2020",I feel like Myungoh is that type of character that isn't gonna die until near the end or not XD
21,"Nov 19, 2020","I’m gonna take a moment to soak in all these dynamic angles 😩🥺💕💕 such good art, can’t wait to read more!"

So to all of those who have gone through something similar your not alone .

21,"Nov 18, 2020",so xenomorph time? chest burst death for one of the most annoying stereotypes (IK he has a name but im not trying to remember it hes borderline stalker) plus not knowing his ability means that he can (likehe failed before) betray and screw everything up again

Those who know, you know and that’s all I am going to say!"
21,"Nov 18, 2020",impregnating tentacles? I've seen enough shmentai to know where this is going!

21,"Nov 18, 2020","I still can't shake the feeling this entire comic is just self insert, escapist fantasy bait. Specifically aimed at people who read webtoons."
21,"Nov 18, 2020",RAPEEEEE!
21,"Nov 18, 2020",There should be a mature warning for this episode lol. With the thrust sfx and the tentacle cumming. I am 13 Don’t ask how I know this stuff

21,"Oct 17, 2020",They always have to add tentacles 🤦🏼‍♂️
21,"Oct 17, 2020",Unbroken Faith has finally arrived. I hope it becomes a full sword or something at some point cause I don’t think it was just a lightsaber to entire time 
21,"Nov 20, 2020",Guys actually the manhwa has reached till chapter 31 with the worst cliffhanger ever! 
21,"Oct 18, 2020","Let’s blow this comic up so we could possibly see Crunchyroll make an anime!! The story is like nothing I’ve read, I enjoy the history (monkey king etc) that is incorporated in this webtoon. I am such a fan and this needs to become an anime 😭❤️"
21,"Jun 23, 2021","I read the Omniscient Reader, then I realize something there is an N, a T and an R"
21,"Apr 29, 2021",good stuff only if it really happened in real life
21,"Apr 26, 2021",Whats his name again? Jin woo or something?
21,"Jan 6, 2021",Omegaverse intensifies
21,"Nov 19, 2020",Did that broken faith remind anyone else of Meliodis’s sword in the beginning of the series??
21,"Nov 18, 2020","I’m reading the novel, and doesn’t it make more sense for Broken faith to be upgraded to Unbroken faith rather than Blade of Faith? Also, I forgot all about the mother thing!!! It makes so much sense now!! Omniscient Reader does not forget about the small details. Everything comes back at some point jn time. Love this story so much!! "
21,"Nov 18, 2020",To read 20 chapters ahead go to maganelo.com
21,"Nov 18, 2020","gee, I've never had top comment!"

21,"Oct 18, 2020",Honestly I’m expecting either myeongoh or the kid to die(really hope the kid doesn’t die)
21,"Oct 18, 2020","So Myeongoh was raped by a demon...I'm loving the karma. (I realize he didn't rape anyone we know of, but he's still a slimy jerk who stole Sanga's bike just to get her in his car)"
21,"Oct 18, 2020",Read a lot? Then I am golden!
21,"Oct 18, 2020",At work reading this 😍

21,"Nov 18, 2020",Sounds like a sword for the Gamer
21,"Nov 18, 2020","ive read the comics till chapter 30 (eng version with good enough quality)... the development after this fight is quite boring for a couple of chapters (weeks)... but now its getting to the nice awesome parts.. so i suggest after its gets boring, u stop reading for a bit"
21,"Mar 22, 2021",Despite i like the idea. This chapter is pure nonsense. I hope author won't end it as trash.

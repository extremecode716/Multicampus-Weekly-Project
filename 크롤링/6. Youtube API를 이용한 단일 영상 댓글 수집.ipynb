He realizes he is the only reader that read up to the final chapter. However, before he can read the epilogue, the moment the author declared TWSA to be monetized at 7pm of his current time, the entire world starts being thrown upside down with apocalyptic situation similar to his favourite TWSA setup. Being the only person who knows how the ruined world will end, Dokja struggles to survive using his knowledge as the omniscient reader in order to reach the epilogue he wish to witness. Little did he know, the world, the companions & characters, the system he grows to love and hate are beyond any fable he could comprehend.\\n\\n*SL*\\r\\nOriginal production: as webnovel in Papyrus + KakaoPage 2014 + 2015 (korean) & Webnovel 2018 (english)\\r\\nCurrent adaptation: as manhwa in D&C + KakaoPage webtoon 2018 (korean) & Webnovel + Tappytoon webtoon 2020 (english)\\r\\nWriter of webnovel: Chugong\\r\\nArtist of manhwa: Redice Studio\\r\\nTheme: Action fantasy\\nFuture adaptation: game, drama\\nSummary: 10 years ago, the Earth is plagued with various extraterrestrial-like Gates that connect two different worlds; monsters and humans. Along their existence is a special power gifted to some humans, giving the latter ability to hunt monsters inside the Gates (known mostly as dungeons) and mines the rare, magic-imbued materials within. Hence, \\'hunters\\' and \\'guilds\\' are established as part of the political balance. Sung Jin-Woo, dubbed by many as the World\\'s Weakest Hunter, is an E-rank hunter with high tenacity to keep diving into near-death experience during hunting for the sake of his family. Comes his final hunt in unexpected double dungeon with death cannot be avoided, some sort of \\'system\\' suddenly appear, giving him option to actually survive from the fatal attack. Since then, he takes the opportunity to learn about the system that only he can access and use it to level up his power, just as how the system is using him to make him stronger than average hunter\\'s capability. Throughout his journey to power up, he overcomes each quest, penalty, enemy, ability limit while finding out the real objective of the system and Gates manifest on Earth.\\n\\n*Opinion*: -\\nTbh, i like both series equally since they are totally different. The only similarity I can see is the art style. Both are slow burn in term of progress from the beginning, but become stronger after 1/6 point and pretty consistent to the end. SL plot is mediocre thus easy to understand, whereas ORV plot is complex. SL has straightforward attack description of action that led immediate impact, whereas ORV has multiple attack engagements with world history-related that may require a bit of thinking before the impact of any action. SL gaming system is only applicable to MC that powers by an entity, whereas ORV apply streaming system to all characters powers by fable/story. SL reaches international popularity due to webtoon hype, whereas ORV has gained international high recognition with webnovel. However, I find myself able to engage more with ORV due to the characters and world-building, especially towards Kim Dokja. I resent and support him, happy and cry for him, empathize and sympathize with him, altogether at the same time.', '1:06 is that girl in white with short hair, Han Sooyoung?', 'The demon king of salvation is silently watching', 'I highly recommend reading the novel, worth it', '글로벌 우리장르 자랑스럽다', 'Just finished the novel and I feel SO DAMN SAD', 'BEST WEBTOON!!!!!!!!!', 'Jonna saranghe', 'Massive Spoiler\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nI think that Han Sooyung and Kim Dokja is the canon ship here, there\\'s this underlying meaning on how Sooyung would write a novel only for one person to read and that is Kim Dokja and Dokja even accepted Han Sooyung\\'s proposal of reading her novel,  Dokja even suggested for its genre to be romance! ROMANCE!! With Kim Dokja even warning her that if he read her novel he might complain, that he\\'s picky, that he would always bug her with comments and that it is possible that he would bug her for more chapters to which Han Sooyung is really glad since that\\'s what Han Sooyung has been searching for.  Han Sooyung was jealous of tls123 (won\\'t spoil who that is  but those who read until final will know ;3) because tls123 got Kim Dokja who would always comment on every single chapter and she really wanted someone like Kim Dokja too. \"If this story can really save you...\" \"Then I\\'ll keep writing the epilogue for you until the end of time, for eternity.\" THIS BASICALLY SHOWS THAT SHE IS WILLING TO GIVE HER ENTIRETY TO HIM FOR ALL ETERNITY. For the last chapters all she has been doing is writing all day and all night in hopes of saving Kim Dokja, she\\'s willing to give her time for all eternity to Kim Dokja and she was the one who basically saved him. Han Sooyung literally saved him in more ways than one with even saving Kim Dokja before the start of everything, there is a paradox within this context ;3 Readers will know. Is it not obvious just how much Han Sooyung means to Kim Dokja and how much Kim Dokja means to Han Sooyung??? They are literally made for each other, the beginning and the end, from before everything started, how everything started, from the start, every moment and until the conclusion. Han Sooyung saved Kim Dokja and Kim Dokja saved Han Sooyung. Kim Dokja agreeing to be her reader means he would dedicate everything of him to her for all eternity, as Kim Dokja said, he is just a reader, and this really shows everything about him-he is a reader. By becoming Han Sooyung\\'s reader, he\\'s basically dedicating his entirety to her. AND they\\'re both constellations, they can literally be with each other, FOREVER. Han Sooyung would write for Kim Dokja for all of eternity and Kim Dokja would dedicate all of himself as a reader for Han Sooyung for all of eternity. HONESTLY THEY\\'RE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT TOGETHER. ABSOLUTELY. IN THE LAST CHAPTERS EVEN IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF HAN SOOYUNG\\'S LONGING FOR KIM DOKJA THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO SAVE KIM DOKJA WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE. She dedicated dedicated her humanity to Kim Dokja, her everything to him and Kim Dokja also lived and was saved because of her, dedicating his all, being Han Sooyung\\'s reader for all of eternity just for her. This is absolutely love, it may even be the truest love I\\'ve ever seen. They dedicate everything of themselves to each other, for all of their ■■ ETERNITY.', '[Constallation Endless has sponsored you 1000 coins]', 'hey webtoon readers if u didn’t know, this is a novel adaptation so yeeeah read that too', \"I don't know if anyone commented on this yet, but I'm liking the bits of animation in this trailer\", 'should i read the webnovel? i already read the raws and im so hypedd!! and does anyone know where to read the webnovel for free?', \"Can't wait to see Yoo Sangah in black Chinese dress 😌👌\", 'If this was an anime it would get anime of the year', 'Vba anyone plz tell me who is thr Guy shown in 0:54 in this trailer I really wanna know', 'This story is a ROLLERCOASTER of emotions', \"ORV is one of the best LN I ever read \\nSo I'm sure it's going to be be a Amazing ride \\nOh \\nI hope they don't make Dokja gay in this...\", '[Viewers have sponsored all their coins]', 'Yeah, the story better than solo lveling.', 'Dokja is my favorite character', 'i just started reading this at the very beginning of this month (may) ... and it’s become one of my ultimate favorites already! it’s so *MWAH!*', \"Why'd it keep saying he's the only reader?

There doesn't seem to be any struggle or deep thoughts or philosophy in the story, just constant power ups. Except for the MC, all the other characters are very forgettable due to how one dimensional they are and it seems the MC is rapidly turning one dimensional and forgettable as well.

From all the Mangas or Novel I have read, never I feel so confused with the plot and stuff, Yet feeling hungry to know what happens next and keep reading as if its something that must be read. The ending was unexpected for me, even tho a friend of mine who introduce me to it has giving a few big spoilers(whcih I asked them to, since I need spoiler to keep reading), I never seen a Novel/Manga with an ending like that, an Ending that makes you feel as if you are the \"???\" Of the story.. I just finished reading chapter 43, to me, it felt like the theatre owner is the author of the novel because he blushed when dokja pierced through his forehead after entering dokja's mind/ memories ,where he saw the texts of the novel... This is probably the best official webtoon trailer I see, props! It's intriguing, straight to the point, intense, and sells the story for exactly what it is. Very nice! Will get animation or something 😁 A song that really suits this webtoon/novel is\n",

I am reading this manga now! I'm dying of  curiousity. What actually is Kim Dokja? What is that one thing even we as readers are still unaware of?

Movie or anime I don't mind as long as it's good. This deserves a great adaptation whenever i reread the novel, i always amaze by how beautiful the author convey the idea and the story telling the story that started in a subway I LOVE orv, because of this, i got to read the entirety of the novel. spoiler alert,\n",

I recommend for ppl to read the novel too if you dont like waiting for new chapters of the manhwa. ANYWAYS, orv rules Love it. mamhwa readers will never know.... how amazing this series is gonna get.. here after chap 551 on the novel.. HAHA dies its so good to the point i binge watch all chapters in a day😂 DOKJAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA   \\(●□●)/ I recently finished this novel and I have never in my life read anything better. I stayed awake until 3 am crying over the ending. It has left me feeling so many emotions but at the same time so empty. This was the greatest read ever. I highly highly recommend it to anyone. Towards the end when everything gets revelaed, your mind will truly be blown. I will never forget this. I miss Dokja already. So much, and the rest too. Unpopular opinion but Omniscient reader > Solo levelling I love Dokja cuz he's so sly and clever. Plus, I can't get enough of the side characters. MC is trash. weak compared to the original old MC.  a weak MC always needs plot armor. noobs in the comments saying it has no plot armor forgot that if you wanna save a weak MC you need tons of plot armor. I hope they will animate ORV in the future. From I seen this is like that show with time traveling microwave. Just pure insanity. 나는 일본인입니다. 나는 이 작품을 사랑한다. 한국인이 일본에 나쁜 인상을 가지고 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다. 그렇지만, 이 작품 덕분에, 테스트로 이순신을 정답 할 수 있었습니다. 나는 어리석은가? I usually don't like reading long, I can't believe I wanted more chapters. Never gonna stop promoting this until every person in this world knows it !! I love dokja so much Dokja is pretty much Anos Voldigoad now lol My favorite webtoon This is easily the best webtoon I’ve ever read. It’s an absolute 10/10. What is the writer name? What chapter does the thumbnail appear?? This Web Trailer that got me into Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint in the First place. The series is soo good that when I ran out of chapters online I Started reading the Novel Version. Well... fuck. That looked pretty damn good.

      "Your double standards are showing, homophobic eh? I love dokja I have read Solo Leveling, and many  adventure webtoon. However,  I must say Omniscient Reader is my favorite one. It gave me great feeling, so much emotion happy and sad, love and hates, rather than just fight and fight. I also love the development of support characters.  And, the best part is the chemistry between Kim Dokja and Yoo Jong Huyk haha I am Yoo Junghyeok reading omniscient reader’s viewpoint was the best decision i’ve ever made, i seriously love it so much Will this getting animated? I never really enjoy reading an action fantasy manhwa but this series got me fixated with my phone for the whole 97 chapters so far\n",

      "Kim Dokja is unpredictable  and I love it! I love you I should've read this much earlier but i think I'm not that late too! So far so great! I'm currently on chapter 70 on its webtoon and I'm so excited Oh god I just feel bad for the people who can’t see the actual novel!! I shouldn’t compare works but honestly this is the best novel I’ve read since Harry Potter. It really feels like there’s a person named Dokja out there. How the authors(the novel writers Shing and Shong) carry out the plot is amazing!! It’s not just the plot, how they describe the scenes and the raw emotions, is beyond art. Believe me, it’s the best thing I’ve read so far and the webtoon is good too. I'm coming back again lmao Since it has a vibe from re: zero so i like it even more i read the Light Novel and all i can say is.... *perfect* Period. what happened to this and the solo levelling anime ? Tuyệt vời hi vọng ra phim Lol their is also novel Sheesh is it been already 1 year damn The moving images made me realize how amazing this would be as an animated series with the same/similar artstyle. Honestly it's a damn good webtoon like seriously it has such an intricate plot so guys please stop comparing this to manhwas like solo leveling. Although i don't hate solo leveling it has a simple storyline but the thing is the side characters get overlooked a lot and the existence of gods and monsters and other worlds felt shoehorned and that makes up for an unsatisfying ending. while on the other hand omniscient reader has a complex story amazing character development and main character kim dokja doesn't punch his way out of every situation like sun jinwoo .No Dokja uses his knowledge of this new world, he makes use of his party members , he always has a plan and that's the thing like about him the most . honestly this webtoon deserves more attention. now again that said i am not in any way saying that solo leveling is inferior to orv. i have read solo leveling believe me it was a very entertaining read but what orv does is it takes some of the elements from SL, fills in the stuff that SL was missing and makes it much enjoyable. would recommend 10/10 Ohh this has a trailer?!?!?!?! To everyone who finished the novel, What kind of ending do you want?😭 This is best novel I've ever read! Highly recommend! Only later does he realize he creates entire universe as a dream and the dream becomes reality while he becomes the god WOAHH listening to mitski while reading novel chapter 188 was the best thing..made me so hyped!. Please make this into a good extremely well animated anime ufotable or someone else huge. HYPEEEEEEEEEEE Wait what he didn't wanted to change the ending he just helping people who didn't survive in the novel... When I searched it said that there will be a movie but it's impossible to cover that much important things in a movie+ manwha too seems to be not ending soon enough.... I hope it's anime series The story make my day but the ending ruin my day WOW! It looks dope as heck! first ever manhwa that made me read the novel, guess what? didn't regret anything, man u don't have any idea how crazy i am for kdj 😌🖤✨✨ Han Sooyoung my wife What are the authors official accounts?? GILYEON IS WORTHY!!!! DOKJA WORLD DOMINATION 🛐 cant help but compare how the mc and his coworker lady look similar to the mc and the first healer lady of solo leveling, offcourse the plots of both novels are like hell and heaven (totally different ) this felt like it came from an Avengers movie trailer oly frick im getting goosegumps Why is there a Manhwa in a webtoon channel?

      "O Friday, when is it going to come down, say quickly, please I had read the manhwa first before finishing the novel... And goddamn orv manhwa now feels way different after all those chapters of the novel.  My perception of the manhwa as i was reading it for the first time was how refreshing it was and plot is packed af. Now i've finished the novel, manhwa's atmosphere became heavy. It's not like the manhwa failed to capture the angst of the novel, it was my expectations who failed me for not noticing the angst beforehand lol \"If I continue to regress will I ever get to meet you again?\" I know I'm late about it but it's actually so funny when he says \"I'm just a reader\" he's also saying his own name XD I like the novel, especially the dokja character 😘❤ 아 전지적 독자 시점이구나ㅋㅋ God I watched this trailer in an ad a year ago and I was like, \"wow this looks like generic garbage.\" One year later I'm 300 chapters in when I realized this trailer was for the webtoon adaptation of orv. This is one of the best web toons I have read in the past year. TOG got too complicated and muggy whereas this is fun, to the point, and surprising. I'm 100% sure that no one can hurt me anymore, thx orv *Painful screach* Just a random Comment DAMN HOPE THEY MAKE THIS MASTER PIECE INTO AN ANIME JUST LIKE SOLO LEVELING The best. fiction. novel. ever!! Okay but it is hard for me not to be scared that this is a other way the story will spread and then the hell will start. I wonder if it is just in Korea or in all the world. I almost done the novel,  I only have two things to say one, Im depressed and two this is a masterpiece 전지적 독자 시점은 웹 소설도 재밌지 Es tan hermoso que voy a llorar i finally reread it and i have realized a lot.. something that i never realize when i first read it. This story is for just that one reader. WEBTOON you need to drop a physical version of the manwha because it is 100% true to the novel’s content (istg the novel is amazing, it never fails to make me cry and laugh) and the art is amazing. Just take my money 😫 MASTERPIECE - that's what ORV is  !- honestly one of my favorite webtoons bc the story is so interesting Spoiler tag:\n",

Wowww The most simultaneously overpowered and not overpowered character I’ve seen in a while lol. He’s interesting because he doesn’t stick to moral high ground. He seemed so shut off and uncertain before it happened, but when the apocalypse came his underlying character burst through and took control Constellation Demon like judge of fire says what incarnation Kim Dokja and incarnation Yoo Junghyuk have is comradeship. The animation of the moving hair, mouth, and eyes are so fucking smooth and cool. I'm dying for an animation because let's be honest, ORV will kill it it gets an anime adaptation. Aaaaaaa Dokjaaaaaa Yep, I just started reading this and it was amazing 👌🏼 Omfg I just realized omniscient reader's viewpoint is just ways of survival with it's reader (Dokja) inserted. So when's the collab with hero cantare? god dammit, dokja's so hot ;-; Look at the dislikes of the trailer. ORV is so hated lol.

However, before he can read the epilogue, the moment the author declared TWSA to be monetized at 7pm of his current time, the entire world starts being thrown upside down with apocalyptic situation similar to his favourite TWSA setup.

Along their existence is a special power gifted to some humans, giving the latter ability to hunt monsters inside the Gates (known mostly as dungeons) and mines the rare, magic-imbued materials within. Hence, 'hunters' and 'guilds' are established as part of the political balance. Sung Jin-Woo, dubbed by many as the World's Weakest Hunter, is an E-rank hunter with high tenacity to keep diving into near-death experience during hunting for the sake of his family. Comes his final hunt in unexpected double dungeon with death cannot be avoided, some sort of 'system' suddenly appear, giving him option to actually survive from the fatal attack. Since then, he takes the opportunity to learn about the system that only he can access and use it to level up his power, just as how the system is using him to make him stronger than average hunter's capability. Throughout his journey to power up, he overcomes each quest, penalty, enemy, ability limit while finding out the real objective of the system and Gates manifest on Earth.\n",

      "Tbh, i like both series equally since they are totally different. The only similarity I can see is the art style. Both are slow burn in term of progress from the beginning, but become stronger after 1/6 point and pretty consistent to the end. SL plot is mediocre thus easy to understand, whereas ORV plot is complex. SL has straightforward attack description of action that led immediate impact, whereas ORV has multiple attack engagements with world history-related that may require a bit of thinking before the impact of any action. SL gaming system is only applicable to MC that powers by an entity, whereas ORV apply streaming system to all characters powers by fable/story. SL reaches international popularity due to webtoon hype, whereas ORV has gained international high recognition with webnovel. However, I find myself able to engage more with ORV due to the characters and world-building, especially towards Kim Dokja. I resent and support him, happy and cry for him, empathize and sympathize with him, altogether at the same time. 1:06 is that girl in white with short hair, Han Sooyoung?

      "I think that Han Sooyung and Kim Dokja is the canon ship here, there's this underlying meaning on how Sooyung would write a novel only for one person to read and that is Kim Dokja and Dokja even accepted Han Sooyung's proposal of reading her novel,  Dokja even suggested for its genre to be romance! ROMANCE!! With Kim Dokja even warning her that if he read her novel he might complain, that he's picky, that he would always bug her with comments and that it is possible that he would bug her for more chapters to which Han Sooyung is really glad since that's what Han Sooyung has been searching for.  Han Sooyung was jealous of tls123 (won't spoil who that is  but those who read until final will know ;3) because tls123 got Kim Dokja who would always comment on every single chapter and she really wanted someone like Kim Dokja too. \"If this story can really save you...\" \"Then I'll keep writing the epilogue for you until the end of time, for eternity.\" THIS BASICALLY SHOWS THAT SHE IS WILLING TO GIVE HER ENTIRETY TO HIM FOR ALL ETERNITY. For the last chapters all she has been doing is writing all day and all night in hopes of saving Kim Dokja, she's willing to give her time for all eternity to Kim Dokja and she was the one who basically saved him. Han Sooyung literally saved him in more ways than one with even saving Kim Dokja before the start of everything, there is a paradox within this context ;3 Readers will know. Is it not obvious just how much Han Sooyung means to Kim Dokja and how much Kim Dokja means to Han Sooyung??? They are literally made for each other, the beginning and the end, from before everything started, how everything started, from the start, every moment and until the conclusion. Han Sooyung saved Kim Dokja and Kim Dokja saved Han Sooyung. Kim Dokja agreeing to be her reader means he would dedicate everything of him to her for all eternity, as Kim Dokja said, he is just a reader, and this really shows everything about him-he is a reader. By becoming Han Sooyung's reader, he's basically dedicating his entirety to her. AND they're both constellations, they can literally be with each other, FOREVER. Han Sooyung would write for Kim Dokja for all of eternity and Kim Dokja would dedicate all of himself as a reader for Han Sooyung for all of eternity. HONESTLY THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT TOGETHER. ABSOLUTELY. IN THE LAST CHAPTERS EVEN IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF HAN SOOYUNG'S LONGING FOR KIM DOKJA THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO SAVE KIM DOKJA WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE. She dedicated dedicated her humanity to Kim Dokja, her everything to him and Kim Dokja also lived and was saved because of her, dedicating his all, being Han Sooyung's reader for all of eternity just for her. This is absolutely love, it may even be the truest love I've ever seen. They dedicate everything of themselves to each other, for all of their ■■ ETERNITY.

He never thought that. He's just the only one to finish reading it. I'm up to volume 3 in the novel and I have to say this is one of the best stories I have read in a long time. You seriously wouldn't regret reading it. The way Dokja uses his knowledge of the story and adjusts to scenes he never expected are so impressive.

The only thing why Solo Leveling is so popular right now is because the art.The more I read this, the more it feels like one of those soulless cultivation Manhuas where the MC gets more and more OP and crushes his opposition easily with little effort. When I first started reading this, I thought there would be some depth to the story, given how the confrontation with the statues played out. But right now it's not anything like that. There doesn't seem to be any struggle or deep thoughts or philosophy in the story, just constant power ups. Except for the MC, all the other characters are very forgettable due to how one dimensional they are and it seems the MC is rapidly turning one dimensional and forgettable as well. It's almost impossible to be emotionally invested in this story, unlike in a good shounen like Naruto or One Piece. Solo Leveling didn’t even get popular until the mahwa come out and become a huge hit while ORV is already popular before the mahwa come out. That’s the different. i love the webtoon hopefully the anime is gonna be good I've just been simping on Kim Dokja and Jung Heewon all the time Finally Oh Kim Dokja... :( Fans of the Webtoon and Webnovel, there's an Omniscient Reader community on Amino, http://aminoapps.com/c/Omniscient_Reader_Amino 👌 one fact wrong. mc is not the only reader. but he is the only reader that finished reading it.

(Isekai is the name of the genre) So going to read this!! What is with the dislikes??? You guys cannot tell me that the mc from omniscent reader doesn't look like the young distant cousin of the mc from solo levelling. Nobody can change my mind👁👄👁 this is the type of comic that keeps u on ur toes and makes u fall flat on ur face for the MC. I don't regret it This deserves a full fledged anime edition. I cannot get enough. My mind has been blown and the art is STRIKINGLY GORGEOUS ｡ﾟ(TヮT)ﾟ｡ cannot wait for more updates ❤️ Constellation \"lazy webers\" smiles!! Man's hacking irl This is better than Solo Leveling. IT HITS IN KOREA SO HARD. Always #1 . This aint a adult manhwa? No gonna lie I got some chill when he said he can change the ending. Ouf this manhwa is crazy one of the best thing about this novel is that it indicates this story being passed to sing N song (the real author of this webtoon) by the op of this story which actually leaves you in the edge with this strong feeling of the apocalypse being real, that this whole webtoon is a real happening and one of us could be mc's reincarnation 존나 좋쿤\n",

Aha the most ancient dream The webnovel of this is one of the best things I've ever read, it was simply amazing for me. 전독시는 어디에서나 전설이다 This webtoon is the perfect example of 2020🤣🤣 Reasons why this is a must-read webtoon:-\n",

Every side characters have their own story and own development. \n",
      "Their are many genres in this story... fantasy, apocalypes, comedy, survival, tragedy, action and even little bromance just for humor. Omnisient Reader's mc is not overpowered character. His only adventage is that he knows all the original story. So he has to solve the difficult situation just with his knowledge. However, he tries to change the story since the original story is full of tragedy and failness. And this makes really interesting story. \n",

I read this on another site and I honestly just can’t wait for more. Be aware of the king of ugly he will speed run this apocalypse with a simple Novel when MC isn't the MC. WHAT THE HELL?! Bruhh...

Finally GREAT STORY LINE WEBTOON SUCCESS 3000 This would make a great anime trailer Alguien más vino por qué le salió mientras veia algo más y estaba tan buena la trama que quedastes atrapado ...pues ami me pasó y se me olvidó el otro video que estaba viendo.. since the novel has over 500 chapters i wonder how many the webtoon will have 🥰. i’ve already used all my coins on this help *Hey Crunchyroll, I need to report you a webtoon/novel to animate...* i reading it, and i'm  fucking exited for the next chapiters You need to read this if you haven’t already Is it gonna turn into an anime I'm so happy this is getting a live action and anime for short, it's going to be a franchise! This novel deserves it after all. The story is really a masterpiece. Imagine this webtoon specifically coming to life the first time you take the subway. Can somebody please tell me the name of the software used to create this intro? Please. Can I just say I love the main character in this story he literally could of saved everyone in the cabin but instead he killed all the eggs on his own so he could kill one guy he didn’t like This is not a yaoi right? Are they planning on putting 551 episodes in to this, because I’ve read the the first few and I need this in my life! I haven’t read the novel but I really hope this web tune will end up being super long Let's make this highest liked Webtoon video in Webtoon channel I’m reading this and the last episode we have to wait for 48 days what the fujsiskxkslakz I’m just kidding but it does take 48 days in order to read the last episode because it takes long to make a WEBTOON so I understand I already finished reading the whole 551 webnovel chapters.

So they finally made it into webtoon This is Gay One of the best things is that the MC won’t be in a romantic relationship, so the shippers can go crazy. But, not having romance also is one of the best thing about it. The novel is a masterpiece. Webtoon had just came out a month or so ago, and I’m here anticipating for an anime to be made.

This man looks a lot like Jin Woo and his scenario is also very similar 🤔😂 Highly Recommend you read the light novel that the webtoon is based on. I’m pretty sure it’s completed too 👍👍👍 Endgame and Infinity War are trembling Kim dokja you fucking bastard 😂😂 literally this is the best novel I've ever read, I was overwhelmed for weeks when I finished, you can't predict anything, the characters developement, everything is insane 💕✔️ This is exactly what I wished whenever I finished reading a novel. I wanted to enter the world of a story😂. For example, I imagined myself as a wizard in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter hahaha. This trailer is, in my opinion, not good. No, I don’t wish to back that up with observations, or facts. I simply had a negative reaction to it, and it made me want to pass on what could easily be a good piece of media. The trailer is epic it's like an animation movie 🤩 It says from the studio that brought you solo leveling but webtoon doesn’t have solo leveling 🤔 I put my high hope that in the coming future, this will become a series episodes! I would definitely watch it no matter what. The animation were so amazing. When i red the first chapter, i've never been such so automatically amazed by it because i can usually sense that this is a spectacular storyline unlike any other comics that takes few chapter that pirques my interest. This comic is on another level! Must recommend for anyone out there who haven't read this yet. A huge regards to the author Ugh, as a reader of the novel, I'm speachless. Dont let me down please.

Keep up with showing us amazing stories turn into webtoons. :) I remember reading this on the  webnovel site. The MC (or viewpoint character if you will) could not stop mentioning how he was the only one to read a certain book to the end. Could have made a drinking game out of it. Now, it's a webtoon? Let's see if they kept that aspect or toned it down. Too late, the damage is done. I like spoilers This is such a good one oh?

LINEマンガで連載してるけどこれも、webtoonだったんか If the “three ways to survive the apocalypse “ was an actual story then this came out, that would’ve been amazing too lol There’s more chapters on a another webs btw I wished this happened to me but instead I get reincarnated as another person and live a fantasy world like in a anime novel or show Read the novel. Loved it. literal chills (´；ω；｀) yes yes yes yesyesyesyes!! A high quality novel is desrving of a high quality webtoon which I am eternally thankful for TT.TT This plot is like a mirror on a mirror creating an infinity sequence of mirrors if this gets an anime broooo please make it an anime This webtoon is new but already shining I'm gonna stay with it though all episodes till the end and then cry my eyes out for another great webtoon ending I underestimated this webtoon but it is a must read.

Who else here from the ad This is at 19 chapters online for free don’t waste ur time in WEBTOON waiting It's like The Neverending Story but better. I knew it they had something similar Lookie lookie there is now three jin-woos Σ('◉⌓◉’) that looks so cool omg Brought to you by creators of solo leveling Ye it’s so tuff I slept on it for a bit cuz I was mad they stop workin on solo leveling Hehe fools who use WEBTOON fear my power of illegal online reading in which there is already 18 chapters not the puny 4 Only a matter of time until we start getting literal animated webtoons. Webtoon.gif hype gonna be strong YESSS THE WEBTOON IS HERE IM GETTING HYPED KYYAAA Why is there only 3 chapters when there's actually 19 or more I hope the mc doesn’t get powers. Like his only ability is that he knows what’s going to happen or maybe he also has some other power, but it doesn’t boost any of his base attributes (or stats if you’re a gamer). Reading a book must've never felt so exciting huh I don’t dont know how they do it but the promotional video always makes the webtoon seem worse then it is. I was actually avoiding this webcom but now...think ima check it ouuuut This new premise has become a rising gem! It reminds me of “My New Life As A Villainess!” and “Scum-Villain’s Self-Saving System” in the awareness of our main character, but it presents this main character as starting as a reader and taking up the role of hero immediately without being placed in the mind of an antagonist! I’m greatly considering it! That was the worst trailer in the world This looks sooooo goood I gotta read this Yea it’s rlly good so far I. Am. Completely compelled to read this. He look like Sun Jin Woo.. You should read I am just reading it it is a must It would hilarious if he just failed, and that’s that. is this solo player prequel If this were made into an anime and made right this could be one of the best animes and this is coming from someone wgo hasnt read it yet and just from the trailer it looks le epik Saw the add. Saw solo leveling in the same title. Clicked. DLAKHSDF THATS LOOKS SO COOL WHAT HOW THE HELL HAVE I NEVER HEARD OF THIS??? 0:37 wait what’s daichi doing here I finished the novel literally 2 days ago. I didn’t know they where making a manga!!!! Can’t wait for this as it was one of my favorites. I really want this to be animated ughhh The novel of this was so fucking good Oh I have read that one. It’s really good 👍👍 The drawing looks almost if not the same as solo leveling If you like good character development, relationships and plot I HIGHLY recommend reading this and the original novel, bc so far its following the novel really well(which is the first web novel I’ve read bc it’s so good) The novel is so good you guys are in for a ride I am so happy this went to webtoon so it may be ANIMATED OR EVEN BE ON A GAME AAAAAHHHH\n",

The art is on another level! Dude I really hope this gets a anime because it’s sooooo good!! Sadly it’s only on chapter 4 on web toon but chapter 19 everywhere else This trailer made every hair on my body stand up.\n",

Yeah, I can tell the story is way better than Solo Leveling ;). Currently reading the light novel if it keeps up this is gonna be one of the best webtoons!\n",

So basically a prologue or an alternate universe of only I level up Whenever i meet a weeb outside or on internet i make sure to recommend this gem.

Seems interesting , I might look into it! Literally read this 3 days ago. This is no longer animated images, by God this is an anime trailer !! Yo when are we gonna get \" Everyone else is a returnee\" I read some of the episodes already and they’re amazing I bet he wrote it for himself from the future I wish anime's existence was just fiction Why did I get logged out my account :( The novel is really good too Dad: reading is power\n",

Guys its not a webtoon original comic thats why its actually good Y’all remember when this was on reaperscans lol can’t wait to read When you already read the novel and your exited for the web toon >:3 Alright, give me all the spoilers NOW Words cannot explain my excitement for this right now. With webtoon getting anime’s this will be a great one for sure I’m already hooked It was an interesting novel. I didn’t like it but you might. Bettt Man. I read the novel a way back since it came out and I was mind blown by how good it was.  NOW we get the comic version. The comic does justice to the novel although some parts are missing because the novel itself has a lot of exposition but they make it up with the art. LIKE THE BACKGROUND IS REALLY IMPORTANT. Like the background of the art comes back as really important stuff. Definitely a new experience just like it was meant to be. I am happy for the comic version. This looks pretty cool Yeet I’ve been injecting this straight into my veins for the past month and a half omg is anyone else excited to ship dokja and jonghyuk🥺. their relationship is probably the most developed out of all of them in the novel and it's so cute🥰\n",

      "(also pls don't hate on this comment😢) This is a very promising webtoon YO THE ANIMATION IS OP I just noticed the MC looks like Jin Woo from Solo Leveling So why is solo leveling not on WEBTOON? Definitely recommend ehhh? This is a WEBTOON? I read it at Zeroscans, better check it out  on the webtoon app might have more chapts (nvm it’s at chapter 5, zeroscans is at like 18, they haven’t uploaded any new chapters so maybe WEBTOON bought the series from them) I thought this was from the Solo Leveling people. It had that art style. So far it’s pretty good Webtoon really is trying to push the ysa fl agenda lol. But ljh looks so cool in that classroom shot!! Oh man it's officially out!! Anyways so everyone join the omniscient reader english fandom discord because the webnovel was great and the webtoon looks just as great so far and they've opened up a discussion area for webtoon only readers so you can talk about what happens as the chapters get released Rip reaperscans they have my respect and I hope webtoon doesn’t make the redraws shit pls don’t do this to us again I THOUGHT THE THUMBNAIL WAS DEKU AND IIDA FROM MHA- but holy damn this looks sick Time to see the greatest bromance in history in art form HYPE HYPE HYPE I just picked up the novel and mwah the flavor.... I already started this on a different site but what the hell are those last chapter never seen that before I started reading this comic because of the free coin event and I swear am not regretting 😍🔥 This webtoon is ❤︎ beautiful ❤︎ solo leveling is such a good webtoon so this should be great as well Anyone not gonna mention that same artist also drew solo leveling?? (Its very obvious thought) This is actually a pretty well written story so far. You can't really predict what is going to happen next. The MC is not exactly the MC of this story, which will make you think what the hell is going on here and trust me when i say this, they actually make this dynamic work. Excited to see how this story goes. When I saw solo leveling I screamed and now it is my duty to read this before I died I never thought I’d see the day webtoon puts a system-esque manhwa on its platform. I assumed it’d never happen... but then again, with Solo Levelling, they’d probably  want to get in on it. Hopefully they’ll put more web novel adapted manhwas on their platform, it’d be nice if they were a bit more mainstream Love the art style since its from the same studio that made Solo Leveling YALL THIS IS THE BEST FUCKING NOVEL I EVER READ. Please give it a read before checking out the web toon, it’s on Webnovel. Why i'm crying watching this? ;-; YAZZZZ FINALLY *Constellation  \"Demon King of Salvation\" is smiling from above* Good shit! Read the novel too! What in the name of off brand sung Jin woo is this WHERE ARE THE ANIMATORS?😭 If you haven't read this yet, I recommend it 100%. The story is absolutely mind-blowing, and I say with complete seriousness that this will probably become one of my favorite webtoons. On another note, I do recommend reading the novel for that extra experience, but I'm really curious to see how this story will turn out as a webtoon.\n",

      "I can't wait! I'm so glad this got an adaption, wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww GET READY TO CRY PEOPLE This gave me solo leveling vibes Wait...did i just see bam... This is such an amazing webtoon. the art is GORGEOUS!!!!!!!!!!!! I was just about to read the novel. Until this came up. And my mind went 'MUST READ'. This is so exciting! Damn I got goosebumps because the background music was intense 😳 It is a must read ✨ Just a heads up!\n",
      "For those of you interested in reading the novel, please give it a try as well! It's really good, and it was one of the first novels that got me into light novels in the first place! The novel was just recently completed too, so you can go ahead and binge read it as well. There is A LOT of world and character building, and watching Yoo Jonghyuk's and Dokja's relationship development (as well as character, though I'd prefer not to spoil it) is going to be a nice treat! For those of you interested in isekai genres, don't mind an OP protagonist, or prefer a protagonist that's down to earth, I highly recommend this, Trash of the Count's Family (an on-going fantasy novel with lots of world building and character dynamics) and the S-classes I raised (which has a similar yet different concept compared to ORV, with a protagonist that's trying to save his little brother). These are the novels I started with, and it's also what got me into light novels in the first place! Please have a look at them! I literally cried for an hour or so from happiness when I heard there would be a manghwa about Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. (っ˘̩╭╮˘̩)っ I HIGHLY RATE THIS MANHWA, I have been a huge fan of the light novel and have read the whole thing, AND with the solo leveling art, it will be amazing WEBTOON TURN THIS INTO AN ANIME YOU WON'T REGRET THE DECISION AND HIRE DESCENT VOICE ACTORS.\n",

Imma go read it ASAP Crunchyroll: time to adapt more manhwas Les falló el audio mis panas pero que belleza de webtoon está destinado a tener el primer lugar al menos unos años Español please I've read ahead in the manhwa and I must say this is a must read! be careful of spoilers everyone! Cooooollll~~` if you guys want to read a bit more, there are 19 eps in mangao.com but youll have to wait like two months to get there on webtoon ;-; I can finally enjoy life because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m* i just like how he say ''Im just a reader'' im like damm son Why I read in webtoon? simply because that guys are soo hot que HAY DIOS MIO!! Okay i am convinced.  Let's give it a try Wow, this looks awesome- YESSS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS I am reading this and is gteat I got a notification of webtoon abt this and then I got a youtube notification so now I am here :) I bet most of you clicked this thinking it was SAO I will be frank with u guys....this webtoon is greater than solo levelling, tomb raider king, SAO, Log horizon, hello world, dungeon seeker, tales of demons and gods, The live, etc. According to me its the best story i have ever read so far. Legit. 😮 So far the best Webtoon trailer I’ve seen I was waiting for this trailer since i started it!!!!! Fact: the same who drew Solo Leveling is now drawing this webtoon. I love it! I just came back from reading solo leveling and saw this as a recommendation. This is good and all but When is solo leveling coming to WEBTOON 😭😭 Bon aller jle call ça va être un des meilleurs webtoon This is so good Can't express how happy I was when I first heard that Line Webtoon got the localization of Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint and not a similar website that have some paywall or some shizz 👀 More ppl get to read ORV for free! I hope they also license Trash Of The Count's Family ughhhhhhh the thoughts of my two faves getting the recognition?? Feels good 💕 Better than most trailers 😂👌 DAMNNNN BEST TRAILER IVE EVER SEEN!!!! a Brooo, this would be an amazing anime I’m feeling a solo leveling vibe from this Webtoon just hyped this up SO FRICKING MUCH!! Imagine how meta it would be if this was the webtoon in the webtoon Al pareacer soy la única que habla español (esta fenomenal el trailer , va a pasar \"años \"para que llegue traducido (︶︹︺).\n",
      "Pero me alegra que existan historias tan buenas ＼(^o^)／. I thought the art style was familiar Jokes on you! Im a huge Solo Leveling Fan, so I read this one already >:D I thought this would be shitty but I read some of it and it’s pretty decent. This looks so much like Solo Leveling, must read❤ Cool! Here comes the normies... Okay am gonna read this I JUST finished reading the first few episodes I've followed the novel. This was perhaps one of the greatest novels I've read. Of course, the protagonist is a cheat in his own way but the world still would kick him down any time he pushes past his boundaries. There were tons of character developments. The worldbuilding was phenomenal. There's really nothing much you can ask of it. Maybe if it had been longer, I guess? Have fun with the webtoon version, read it to the end, you won't regret it. I can't be the only one who thinks this is almost as good as those Marvel trailers XD The problem is this WEBTOON has 18 translated chapters already but on WEBTOON it has 9 with fast pass no one would pay for old chapters just release all the available chapters then people would read it on your website or it would be the same as dice OMG i still cant believe its on webtoon now YESSS When will they make a trailer for \n",

      "Me : then who am I? :\")))))) Han sooyong is the writer I dont really read novel, specially Korean ones. But I Must say, ORV is an Amazing, well-Created Story. From all the Mangas or Novel I have read, never I feel so confused with the plot and stuff, Yet feeling hungry to know what happens next and keep reading as if its something that must be read. The ending was unexpected for me, even tho a friend of mine who introduce me to it has giving a few big spoilers(whcih I asked them to, since I need spoiler to keep reading), I never seen a Novel/Manga with an ending like that, an Ending that makes you feel as if you are the \"???\" Of the story.. I just finished reading chapter 43, to me, it felt like the theatre owner is the author of the novel because he blushed when dokja pierced through his forehead after entering dokja's mind/ memories ,where he saw the texts of the novel... This is probably the best official webtoon trailer I see, props! It's intriguing, straight to the point, intense, and sells the story for exactly what it is. Very nice! Will get animation or something üòÅ A song that really suits this webtoon/novel is\n",

      ":) good luck to fellow readers This NEEDS to be an anime so  would without a doubt be WAY better than  some of the main stream ones that are popular ATM. Reading the novel then the comic  make it even more impactful cant imagine how bad ass the fire dragon scene would be not to mention the other disasters. Yeah. I'm just a Reader cool wow! I am reading this manga now! I'm dying of  curiousity. What actually is Kim Dokja? What is that one thing even we as readers are still unaware of? The contellation, Conie, recommends everyone to read this piece of art. i read this webtoon months ago and finally decided to read the novel too. finished it recently, and just WOWWwW i don't regret ever reading it, even tho it's probably the only thing i did this summer lol series is so good Are we getting an adaptation of this? Movie or anime I don't mind as long as it's good. This deserves a great adaptation whenever i reread the novel, i always amaze by how beautiful the author convey the idea and the story telling the story that started in a subway I LOVE orv, because of this, i got to read the entirety of the novel. spoiler alert,\n",

      "it's an open ending. so you get to imagine whatever ending you want üíÄ there's also multiple loops and paradoxes in the novel, so it's one hell of a roller coaster. I recommend for ppl to read the novel too if you dont like waiting for new chapters of the manhwa. ANYWAYS, orv rules Love it. mamhwa readers will never know.... how amazing this series is gonna get.. here after chap 551 on the novel.. HAHA dies its so good to the point i binge watch all chapters in a dayüòÇ DOKJAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA   \\(‚óè‚ñ°‚óè)/ I recently finished this novel and I have never in my life read anything better. I stayed awake until 3 am crying over the ending. It has left me feeling so many emotions but at the same time so empty. This was the greatest read ever. I highly highly recommend it to anyone. Towards the end when everything gets revelaed, your mind will truly be blown. I will never forget this. I miss Dokja already. So much, and the rest too. Unpopular opinion but Omniscient reader > Solo levelling I love Dokja cuz he's so sly and clever. Plus, I can't get enough of the side characters. MC is trash. weak compared to the original old MC.  a weak MC always needs plot armor. noobs in the comments saying it has no plot armor forgot that if you wanna save a weak MC you need tons of plot armor. I hope they will animate ORV in the future. From I seen this is like that show with time traveling microwave. Just pure insanity. ÎÇòÎäî ÏùºÎ≥∏Ïù∏ÏûÖÎãàÎã§. ÎÇòÎäî Ïù¥ ÏûëÌíàÏùÑ ÏÇ¨ÎûëÌïúÎã§.

What chapter does the thumbnail appear?? This Web Trailer that got me into Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint in the First place. The series is soo good that when I ran out of chapters online I Started reading the Novel Version. Well... fuck. That looked pretty damn good. If I didn't already read it, this would have me hunting for it in a heartbeat. My friend:I'm thinking if I should join orv fandom\n",

      "*I'm still trying to convince her to join the fandom lol* i've read the novel over 4 times already the best I LOVE YOU KIM DOKJA!!! I've caught up to the current chapter  and am now reading the web novel. The main character is relateable. I am reading this novel to cope with what's going on in reality. I have GAD and this honestly helps me distract my mind from everything. I am enamored by it. It's truly a good story. A story about stories. ORV ANIME WHEN my favorite novel of all timeüíûüíûüíû Really hope this series gets animated one day The best story have the best mc, Dokja driving me crazyyyyy afbafhsfhsfjtahgcvdvaahf The novel got me crying tho- See you guys inside a subway 10 years later Que delicia de webtoon meus amigos Can u imagine when the webtoon gets to 188 lol bro im bawling my eyes out I hope this comic become anime Yoo Joonghyuk: Who are you\n",
      "Lee Jihye: *gasps in Korean* master! He is obviously the love of your life! I came expecting copper but holy shit I found a gem mine. I literally thought it's your typical action comic containing all the tropes you'd find in the book and now I'm reading what could've be one of the best webnovels to grace this dark planet. truly one of the best When we say you guys are not ready... trust us for what is about to come, your jaws are about to fall and fall hard To the ppl who doesn't ship jungheok x dokja and say dokja x sooyoung or dokja x sangah is better, just imagine Jungheok was a girl, then y'all wouldn't have spent a sec to ship them.\n",
      "Your double standards are showing, homophobic eh? I love dokja I have read Solo Leveling, and many  adventure webtoon. However,  I must say Omniscient Reader is my favorite one. It gave me great feeling, so much emotion happy and sad, love and hates, rather than just fight and fight. I also love the development of support characters.  And, the best part is the chemistry between Kim Dokja and Yoo Jong Huyk haha I am Yoo Junghyeok reading omniscient reader‚Äôs viewpoint was the best decision i‚Äôve ever made, i seriously love it so much Will this getting animated? I never really enjoy reading an action fantasy manhwa but this series got me fixated with my phone for the whole 97 chapters so far\n",

      "Kim Dokja is unpredictable  and I love it! I love you I should've read this much earlier but i think I'm not that late too! So far so great! I'm currently on chapter 70 on its webtoon and I'm so excited Oh god I just feel bad for the people who can‚Äôt see the actual novel!! I shouldn‚Äôt compare works but honestly this is the best novel I‚Äôve read since Harry Potter. It really feels like there‚Äôs a person named Dokja out there. How the authors(the novel writers Shing and Shong) carry out the plot is amazing!! It‚Äôs not just the plot, how they describe the scenes and the raw emotions, is beyond art. Believe me, it‚Äôs the best thing I‚Äôve read so far and the webtoon is good too. I'm coming back again lmao Since it has a vibe from re: zero so i like it even more i read the Light Novel and all i can say is.... *perfect* Period. what happened to this and the solo levelling anime ? Tuy·ªát v·ªùi hi v·ªçng ra phim Lol their is also novel Sheesh is it been already 1 year damn The moving images made me realize how amazing this would be as an animated series with the same/similar artstyle. Honestly it's a damn good webtoon like seriously it has such an intricate plot so guys please stop comparing this to manhwas like solo leveling. Although i don't hate solo leveling it has a simple storyline but the thing is the side characters get overlooked a lot and the existence of gods and monsters and other worlds felt shoehorned and that makes up for an unsatisfying ending. while on the other hand omniscient reader has a complex story amazing character development and main character kim dokja doesn't punch his way out of every situation like sun jinwoo .No Dokja uses his knowledge of this new world, he makes use of his party members , he always has a plan and that's the thing like about him the most . honestly this webtoon deserves more attention. now again that said i am not in any way saying that solo leveling is inferior to orv. i have read solo leveling believe me it was a very entertaining read but what orv does is it takes some of the elements from SL, fills in the stuff that SL was missing and makes it much enjoyable. would recommend 10/10 Ohh this has a trailer?!?!?!?! To everyone who finished the novel, What kind of ending do you want?üò≠ This is best novel I've ever read! Highly recommend! Only later does he realize he creates entire universe as a dream and the dream becomes reality while he becomes the god WOAHH listening to mitski while reading novel chapter 188 was the best thing..made me so hyped!. Please make this into a good extremely well animated anime ufotable or someone else huge. HYPEEEEEEEEEEE Wait what he didn't wanted to change the ending he just helping people who didn't survive in the novel... When I searched it said that there will be a movie but it's impossible to cover that much important things in a movie+ manwha too seems to be not ending soon enough.... I hope it's anime series The story make my day but the ending ruin my day WOW! It looks dope as heck! first ever manhwa that made me read the novel, guess what? didn't regret anything, man u don't have any idea how crazy i am for kdj üòåüñ§‚ú®‚ú® Han Sooyoung my wife What are the authors official accounts?? GILYEON IS WORTHY!!!! DOKJA WORLD DOMINATION üõê cant help but compare how the mc and his coworker lady look similar to the mc and the first healer lady of solo leveling, offcourse the plots of both novels are like hell and heaven (totally different ) this felt like it came from an Avengers movie trailer oly frick im getting goosegumps Why is there a Manhwa in a webtoon channel?

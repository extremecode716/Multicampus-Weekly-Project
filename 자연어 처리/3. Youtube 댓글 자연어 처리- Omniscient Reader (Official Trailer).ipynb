      "i think that han sooyung and kim dokja is the canon ship here, there's this underlying meaning on how sooyung would write a novel only for one person to read and that is kim dokja and dokja even accepted han sooyung's proposal of reading her novel,  dokja even suggested for its genre to be romance! romance!! with kim dokja even warning her that if he read her novel he might complain, that he's picky, that he would always bug her with comments and that it is possible that he would bug her for more chapters to which han sooyung is really glad since that's what han sooyung has been searching for.  han sooyung was jealous of tls123 (won't spoil who that is  but those who read until final will know ;3) because tls123 got kim dokja who would always comment on every single chapter and she really wanted someone like kim dokja too. \"if this story can really save you...\" \"then i'll keep writing the epilogue for you until the end of time, for eternity.\" this basically shows that she is willing to give her entirety to him for all eternity. for the last chapters all she has been doing is writing all day and all night in hopes of saving kim dokja, she's willing to give her time for all eternity to kim dokja and she was the one who basically saved him. han sooyung literally saved him in more ways than one with even saving kim dokja before the start of everything, there is a paradox within this context ;3 readers will know. is it not obvious just how much han sooyung means to kim dokja and how much kim dokja means to han sooyung??? they are literally made for each other, the beginning and the end, from before everything started, how everything started, from the start, every moment and until the conclusion. han sooyung saved kim dokja and kim dokja saved han sooyung. kim dokja agreeing to be her reader means he would dedicate everything of him to her for all eternity, as kim dokja said, he is just a reader, and this really shows everything about him-he is a reader. by becoming han sooyung's reader, he's basically dedicating his entirety to her. and they're both constellations, they can literally be with each other, forever. han sooyung would write for kim dokja for all of eternity and kim dokja would dedicate all of himself as a reader for han sooyung for all of eternity. honestly they're absolutely perfect together. absolutely. in the last chapters even it was all because of han sooyung's longing for kim dokja that they were able to save kim dokja which was supposed to be impossible. she dedicated dedicated her humanity to kim dokja, her everything to him and kim dokja also lived and was saved because of her, dedicating his all, being han sooyung's reader for all of eternity just for her. this is absolutely love, it may even be the truest love i've ever seen. they dedicate everything of themselves to each other, for all of their ■■ eternity.[constallation endless has sponsored you 1000 coins]hey webtoon readers if u didn’t know, this is a novel adaptation so yeeeah read that tooi don't know if anyone commented on this yet, but i'm liking the bits of animation in this trailershould i read the webnovel? i already read the raws and im so hypedd!! and does anyone know where to read the webnovel for free?can't wait to see yoo sangah in black chinese dress 😌👌if this was an anime it would get anime of the yearvba anyone plz tell me who is thr guy shown in 0:54 in this trailer i really wanna knowthis story is a rollercoaster of emotionsorv is one of the best ln i ever read \n",

really read novel specially korean ones but i must say orv is an amazing wellcreated story from all the mangas or novel i have read never i feel so confused with the plot and stuff yet feeling hungry to know what happens next and keep reading as if its something that must be read the ending was unexpected for me even tho a friend of mine who introduce me to it has giving a few big spoilerswhcih i asked them to since i need spoiler to keep reading i never seen a novelmanga with an ending like that an ending that makes you feel as if you are the  of the storyi just finished reading chapter  to me it felt like the theatre owner is the author of the novel because he blushed when dokja pierced through his forehead after entering dokjas mind memories where he saw the texts of the novelthis is probably the best official webtoon trailer i see props its intriguing straight to the point intense and sells the story for exactly what it is very nicewill get animation or something 😁a song that really suits this webtoonnovel isrokudenashi  one voice good luck to fellow readersthis needs to be an anime so  would without a doubt be way better than  some of the main stream ones that are popular atm reading the novel then the comic  make it even more impactful cant imagine how bad ass the fire dragon scene would be not to mention the other disastersyeah im just a readercoolwow i am reading this manga nowim dying of  curiousity what actually is kim dokja what is that one thing even we as readers are still unaware ofthe contellation conie recommends everyone to read this piece of arti read this webtoon months ago and finally decided to read the novel too finished it recently and just wowwww i dont regret ever reading it even tho its probably the only thing i did this summer lolseries is so goodare we getting an adaptation of this movie or anime i dont mind as long as its good this deserves a great adaptationwhenever i reread the novel i always amaze by how beautiful the author convey the idea and the story tellingthe story that started in a subwayi love orv because of this i got to read the entirety of the novel spoiler alertits an open ending so you get to imagine whatever ending you want 💀 theres also multiple loops and paradoxes in the novel so its one hell of a roller coaster i recommend for ppl to read the novel too if you dont like waiting for new chapters of the manhwa anyways orv ruleslove itmamhwa readers will never know how amazing this series is gonna get here after chap  on the novel haha diesits so good to the point i binge watch all chapters in a day😂dokjaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa   \\●□●i recently finished this novel and i have never in my life read anything better i stayed awake until  am crying over the ending it has left me feeling so many emotions but at the same time so empty this was the greatest read ever i highly highly recommend it to anyone towards the end when everything gets revelaed your mind will truly be blown i will never forget this i miss dokja already so much and the rest toounpopular opinion but omniscient reader  solo levellingi love dokja cuz hes so sly and clever plus i cant get enough of the side charactersmc is trash weak compared to the original old mc  a weak mc always needs plot armor noobs in the comments saying it has no plot armor forgot that if you wanna save a weak mc you need tons of plot armori hope they will animate orv in the futurefrom i seen this is like that show with time traveling microwave just pure insanity나는 일본인입니다 나는 이 작품을 사랑한다 한국인이 일본에 나쁜 인상을 가지고 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다 그렇지만 이 작품 덕분에 테스트로 이순신을 정답 할 수 있었습니다 나는 어리석은가i usually dont like reading long i cant believe i wanted more chapters never gonna stop promoting this until every person in this world knows it i love dokja so muchdokja is pretty much anos voldigoad now lolmy favorite webtoonthis is easily the best webtoon i’ve ever read it’s an absolute what is the writer namewhat chapter does the thumbnail appearthis web trailer that got me into omniscient readers viewpoint in the first place the series is soo good that when i ran out of chapters online i started reading the novel versionwell fuck that looked pretty damn good if i didnt already read it this would have me hunting for it in a heartbeatmy friendim thinking if i should join orv fandommeyou should things you will get when you join are pain depression grief sadness sorrow tears you losing your sanity and most importantly youll lose your straightnessmy friendgirl what😧im still trying to convince her to join the fandom lolive read the novel over  times alreadythe besti love you kim dokjaive caught up to the current chapter  and am now reading the web novel the main character is relateable i am reading this novel to cope with whats going on in reality i have gad and this honestly helps me distract my mind from everything i am enamored by it its truly a good story a story about storiesorv anime whenmy favorite novel of all time💞💞💞really hope this series gets animated one daythe best story have the best mc dokja driving me crazyyyyy afbafhsfhsfjtahgcvdvaahfthe novel got me crying thosee you guys inside a subway  years laterque delicia de webtoon meus amigoscan u imagine when the webtoon gets to  lolbro im bawling my eyes outi hope this comic become animeyoo joonghyuk who are youlee jihye gasps in korean master he is obviously the love of your lifei came expecting copper but holy shit i found a gem mine i literally thought its your typical action comic containing all the tropes youd find in the book and now im reading what couldve be one of the best webnovels to grace this dark planettruly one of the bestwhen we say you guys are not ready trust us for what is about to come your jaws are about to fall and fall hardto the ppl who doesnt ship jungheok x dokja and say dokja x sooyoung or dokja x sangah is better just imagine jungheok was a girl then yall wouldnt have spent a sec to ship themyour double standards are showing homophobic ehi love dokjai have read solo leveling and many  adventure webtoon however  i must say omniscient reader is my favorite one it gave me great feeling so much emotion happy and sad love and hates rather than just fight and fight i also love the development of support characters  and the best part is the chemistry between kim dokja and yoo jong huyk hahai am yoo junghyeokreading omniscient reader’s viewpoint was the best decision i’ve ever made i seriously love it so muchwill this getting animatedi never really enjoy reading an action fantasy manhwa but this series got me fixated with my phone for the whole  chapters so farfor  days straighti never feel so curious about a story because i cant guess what will happen nextkim dokja is unpredictable  and i love iti love youi shouldve read this much earlier but i think im not that late too so far so great im currently on chapter  on its webtoon and im so excitedoh god i just feel bad for the people who can’t see the actual novel i shouldn’t compare works but honestly this is the best novel i’ve read since harry potter it really feels like there’s a person named dokja out there how the authorsthe novel writers shing and shong carry out the plot is amazing it’s not just the plot how they describe the scenes and the raw emotions is beyond art believe me it’s the best thing i’ve read so far and the webtoon is good tooim coming back again lmaosince it has a vibe from re zero so i like it even morei read the light novel and all i can say is perfect periodwhat happened to this and the solo levelling anime tuyệt vời hi vọng ra phimlol their is also novelsheesh is it been already  year damnthe moving images made me realize how amazing this would be as an animated series with the samesimilar artstylehonestly its a damn good webtoon like seriously it has such an intricate plot so guys please stop comparing this to manhwas like solo leveling although i dont hate solo leveling it has a simple storyline but the thing is the side characters get overlooked a lot and the existence of gods and monsters and other worlds felt shoehorned and that makes up for an unsatisfying ending while on the other hand omniscient reader has a complex story amazing character development and main character kim dokja doesnt punch his way out of every situation like sun jinwoo no dokja uses his knowledge of this new world he makes use of his party members  he always has a plan and thats the thing like about him the most  honestly this webtoon deserves more attention now again that said i am not in any way saying that solo leveling is inferior to orv i have read solo leveling believe me it was a very entertaining read but what orv does is it takes some of the elements from sl fills in the stuff that sl was missing and makes it much enjoyable would recommend ohhthis has a trailerto everyone who finished the novel what kind of ending do you want😭this is best novel ive ever read highly recommendonly later does he realize he creates entire universe as a dream and the dream becomes reality while he becomes the godwoahhlistening to mitski while reading novel chapter  was the best thingmade me so hypedplease make this into a good extremely well animated anime ufotable or someone else hugehypeeeeeeeeeeewait what he didnt wanted to change the ending he just helping people who didnt survive in the novel when i searched it said that there will be a movie but its impossible to cover that much important things in a movie manwha too seems to be not ending soon enough i hope its anime seriesthe story make my day but the ending ruin my daywow it looks dope as heckfirst ever manhwa that made me read the novel guess what didnt regret anything man u dont have any idea how crazy i am for kdj 😌🖤✨✨han sooyoung my wifewhat are the authors official accountsgilyeon is worthydokja world domination 🛐cant help but compare how the mc and his coworker lady look similar to the mc and the first healer lady of solo leveling offcourse the plots of both novels are like hell and heaven totally different this felt like it came from an avengers movie trailer oly frick im getting goosegumpswhy is there a manhwa in a webtoon channelorv is absolutely amazing i read the whole novel a few months ago and am uptodate with the webtoon      the story plot is very different from the normal mc read the

after all those chapters of the novel  my perception of the manhwa as i was reading it for the first time was how refreshing it was and plot is packed af now ive finished the novel manhwas atmosphere became heavy its not like the manhwa failed to capture the angst of the novel it was my expectations who failed me for not noticing the angst beforehand lolif i continue to regress will i ever get to meet you againi know im late about it but its actually so funny when he says im just a reader hes also saying his own name xdi like the novel especially the dokja character 😘❤아 전지적 독자 시점이구나ㅋㅋgod i

ending while listening to cold plays everglow made me cry like a riveri love dokja sm😫 i cry everytime i remember the noveli have lovehate relationship to masterpieces like this 😭 ive just know about the epilogue of this webtoon in its webnovel and its just wholesome and sad at the same time for me the type of story that you know that its super amazing but wholesomely broke your heart at the same time 😭i love how the true substance of this story isnt something like wish fulfillment op mc with corny romance and power fantasy hype despite being under the systemapocalypse themethe story is incredible albeit painfully slow burn and theres no telling what happensthe charm doesnt only stick and revolve around the mc and the side characters dont feel onedimensional and actually progresses on and off screen theres no pandering or delay in each chapter and story progression is real here every mystery is unfolded throughout the story and plot holes are properly concluded i truly appreciate plotcentric stories like this literal goldfor whoever still doubt whether to read this webtoon or no you must read it it is so greatttttt you wont regret it i already read the webtoon

equally since they are totally different the only similarity i can see is the art style both are slow burn in term of progress from the beginning but become stronger after  point and pretty consistent to the end sl plot is mediocre thus easy to understand whereas orv plot is complex sl has straightforward attack description of action that led immediate impact whereas orv has multiple attack engagements with world historyrelated that may require a bit of thinking before the impact of any action sl gaming system is only applicable to mc that powers by an entity whereas orv apply streaming system to all characters powers by fablestory sl reaches international popularity due to webtoon hype whereas orv has gained international high recognition with webnovel however i find myself able to engage more with orv due to the characters and worldbuilding especially towards kim dokja i resent and support him happy and cry for him empathize and sympathize with him altogether at the same time is that girl in white with short hair han sooyoungthe demon king of salvation is silently watchingi highly recommend reading the novel worth it글로벌 우리장르 자랑스럽다just finished the novel and i feel so damn sadbest webtoonjonna saranghemassive spoileri think that han sooyung and kim dokja is the canon ship here theres this underlying meaning on how sooyung would write a novel only for one person to read and that is kim dokja and dokja even accepted han sooyungs proposal of reading her novel  dokja even suggested for its genre to be romance romance with kim dokja even warning her that if he read her novel he might complain that hes picky that he would always bug her with comments and that it is possible that he would bug her for more chapters to which han sooyung is really glad since thats what han sooyung has been searching for  han sooyung was jealous of tls wont spoil who that is  but those who read until final will know  because tls got kim dokja who would always comment on every single chapter and she really wanted someone like kim dokja too if this story can really save you then ill keep writing the epilogue for you until the end of time for eternity this basically shows that she is willing to give her entirety to him for all eternity for the last chapters all she has been doing is writing all day and all night in hopes of saving kim dokja shes willing to give her time for all eternity to kim dokja and she was the one who basically saved him han sooyung literally saved him in more ways than one with even saving kim dokja before the start of everything there is a paradox within this context  readers will know is it not obvious just how much han sooyung means to kim dokja and how much kim dokja means to han sooyung they are literally made for each other the beginning and the end from before everything started how everything started from the start every moment and until the conclusion han sooyung saved kim dokja and kim dokja saved han sooyung kim dokja agreeing to be her reader means he would dedicate everything of him to her for all eternity as kim dokja said he is just a reader and this really shows everything about himhe is a reader by becoming han sooyungs reader hes basically dedicating his entirety to her and theyre both constellations they can literally be with each other forever han sooyung would write for kim dokja for all of eternity and kim dokja would dedicate all of himself as a reader for han sooyung for all of eternity honestly theyre absolutely perfect together absolutely in the last chapters even it was all because of han sooyungs longing for kim dokja that they were able to save kim dokja which was supposed to be impossible she dedicated dedicated her humanity to kim dokja her everything to him and kim dokja also lived and was saved because of her dedicating his all being han sooyungs reader for all of eternity just for her this is absolutely love it may even be the truest love ive ever seen they dedicate everything of themselves to each other for all of their ■■ eternityhey webtoon readers if u didn’t know this is a novel adaptation so yeeeah read that tooi dont know if anyone commented on this yet but im liking the bits of animation in this trailershould i read the webnovel i already read the raws and im so hypedd and does anyone know where to read the webnovel for freecant wait to see yoo sangah in black chinese dress 😌👌if this was an anime it would get anime of the yearvba anyone plz tell me who is thr guy shown in  in this trailer i really wanna knowthis story is a rollercoaster of emotionsorv is one of the best ln i ever read so im sure its going to be be a amazing ride oh i hope they dont make dokja gay in thisyeah the story better than solo lvelingdokja is my favorite characteri just started reading this at the very beginning of this month may  and it’s become one of my ultimate favorites already it’s so mwahwhyd it keep saying hes the only reader he never thought that hes just the only one to finish reading itim up to volume  in the novel and i have to say this is one of the best stories i have read in a long time you seriously wouldnt regret reading it the way dokja uses his knowledge of the story and adjusts to scenes he never expected are so impressiveguys do you know that dokja독자 means reader in korean so the title of this novel is omniscient reader view point 전지적 독자 시점will there be an animedamn this trailer is some another level shiti am just waiting for biyuujust finished reading the webnovel and i must say orv was the best novel ive ever read in my whole life i felt so empty alr and i dont usually reread a story but now id like to read it again orv made me appreciate reading a story to know diff povs of the characters i cant wait to read the upcoming chapters in webtoon too ❣️i recommend this so badly its so good read it i beg you you wont regret itits a mix of fantasy action and comedy i thought webtoon doesnt allow blood scenes 우리 독자 너무 잘생겼지 않음there are three ways to survive the apocalypse but that doesnt mean that only three people can survivei hope webtoon version give this series a happy family side story  our lovely squid dokja constellations deserve ittt 😭my dokjaaaaaaaaaaaa oh my god yeeeessssss this series got me hooked ay the first episode it is amazing and how he usus his knowdlege오 네이버 웹툰 영어판이 사이트가 있구나 근데요 전부다 무료네 뭐지김독자가 맛있고 중혁이가 만든 음식이 멋있는 그 웹툰소설okay but was this inspired from the japanese drama alice in borderlandi have read the webtoon but the plot is same for both survival games its just aib is more gore amd horror and this is scifiokay soo i calculated for how many years it will take for the manhwa to finishthere are a total of  chapters in the novel week   chapter month   chapters year   chaptersso  chapters   chapters a year   years years x  days   total days to finishand i didnt include other variables that may affect the number of chapters made eg months of hiatus and that theyll shortencut some scenes from the novel so that they can catch up and wont take too long to be completedso maybe the estimated years to finish will be about  years at least because the artist needs to take hiatus to prepare for the next season and also if theres any accidents or health issuesdamn thats long but ill wait because im so excited to see it drawnthis novel is completely different from the rest it is truly a whole new level of novel  in the novel is full of elements and believe me you wont be able to guess what will happen next  and have you ever tried to imagine yourself in a series where you are not the main character  and this series of novels will satisfy you it is very worth to read ita few chapters in and im already going crazy this is so damn good good doesnt even begin to explain how good it isprepare your tissues in advancethus the ugliest king was bornim a new reader of the webtoon but i am curious as to why huiwon isnt famous among the characters i mean i really love her character and i actually ship her with dokja😭am i the only onebtw should i wait for the manhwa or should i read the novellike very much this serie  ☺️when you like this so much it feels like you were became a certain constellation hungry for the story for this shit offif this doesnt get animated in the next  years or something i swear im ready to fightmerinding gila ngeliat trailernya this story has a lot of ■■■ our protagonist would get ■■■ and be ■■■ there are many fun characyers like yjh the ■■■ who is also ■■■ and an annoying character named h■■ who will be the protagonists ■■■paradox among paradox imoive been reading the noveland it legitimately makes you cry at timesits so goodits been a few months since ive read the novel and im still getting chillsi fking love this bookimagine if this gets an anime adaptation would probably take the world by storm ✨👏🏻who are youim just a reader and im the only one who knows the end of this worldi really hope this gets an anime or dramaguys  how do you make such good content what the fuckkkk im so excitedits been so long since ive finished the novel and ngl im still feeling empty whenever im missing dokja every now and then lmao imagine being so attached to a man who doesnt exist in your world line 🤡🤡oh es sorprende el número de visitas del vídeo ya entiendo porque es tan famoso en inglésthe  dislikes are from sl simps vdokja im just a readerme that is what im going to say if every comic from webtoon or manga become real why the heck she smiling at him🔊relationship alert🔊the light novel reader will be like kim dokja while talking to manhwa readers lololwhats the name of the song used in the trailerahhh goosebumps잘 만들었잖아 🥰esse manhwa é perfeitoaahhh kim dokja  uwaaaaahhhhhhhhthis is way better than solo leveling the only thing why solo leveling is so popular right now is because the artthe more i read this the more it feels like one of those soulless cultivation manhuas where the mc gets more and more op and crushes his opposition easily with little effort when i first started reading this i thought there would be some depth to the story given how the confrontation with the statues played out but right now its not anything like that there doesnt seem to be any struggle or deep thoughts or philosophy in the story just constant power ups except for the mc all the other characters are very forgettable due to how one dimensional they are and it seems the mc is rapidly turning one dimensional and forgettable as well its almost impossible to be emotionally invested in this story unlike in a good shounen like naruto or one piece solo leveling didn’t even get popular until the mahwa come out and become a huge hit while orv is already popular before the mahwa come out that’s the differenti love the webtoon hopefully the anime is gonna be goodive just been simping on kim dokja and jung heewon all the timefinallyoh kim dokja fans of the webtoon and webnovel theres an omniscient reader community on amino httpaminoappscomcomniscient_reader_amino 👌one fact wrong mc is not the only reader but he is the only reader that finished reading itdokja is lowkey sung jin wooprobably the best book ive readthe

always # this aint a adult manhwano gonna lie i got some chill when he said he can change the ending ouf this manhwa is crazyone of the best thing about this novel is that it indicates this story being passed to sing n song the real author of this webtoon by the op of this story which actually leaves you in the edge with this strong feeling of the apocalypse being real that this whole webtoon is a real happening and one of us could be mcs reincarnation존나 좋쿤fuckin yeahabout time it seems the best novel in history came with a webnovel hell yeaheu decido ver do que é o manhwa aí vejo issoit

nerden izlerim bunu yardım edin mangasını okuyorum şu anthe best part about this webtoon is that everyone thinks dokja is gaylove this webtoonaha the most ancient dreamthe webnovel of this is one of the best things ive ever read it was simply amazing for me전독시는 어디에서나 전설이다this webtoon is the perfect example of 🤣🤣reasons why this is a mustread webtoonthe entire freaking plot is so badass that you wont be able to handle it 😁mc dokja is the most savage protagonist you ever gonna meet 😇tons of other reasons are there too but my hands ache from typing but i promise you you wont ever regret clicking fight like a reader~dokjaomnisient reader is very different from some other manhwas or novels like every boys admire mc and every girls fall in love to mc every side characters have their own story and own development their are many genres in this story fantasy apocalypes comedy survival tragedy action and even little bromance just for humor omnisient readers mc is not overpowered character his only adventage is that he knows all the original story so he has to solve the difficult situation just with his knowledge however he tries to change the story since the original story is full of tragedy and failness and this makes really interesting story i highly recommand to read this both the webtoon and the novel its plot is awesome and all characters are great the novels english translation is quite awful but its okay to read iti read this on another site and i honestly just can’t wait for morebe aware of the king of ugly he will speed run this apocalypse with a simple novelwhen mc isnt the mc what the hellbruhh i already read this but😑 this is my first time watching this so its giving me a goosebumps😱☺️hahhahahahha😁so when are you gonna do a trailer for eleceedi just hope there will be no romance in thisour kim dokja is so handsome~spoilerthis trailer the last panel is that the th scenario the arkĺittttive been thinking abt this for some time now to novel readersarent we all the most ancient dream rather than a constelation since hsy basically wrote orv and the ending of the epilouge was left to be ambigious leaving us to use our own imagination on what we think the ending is basically dreaming about itwell turns out he isn’t the only reader lol peak homoerotic tensionnow this is a webtoon worth reading who knows one out millions of novels mangas etc can most likely become reality especially the apocalypselove this story hope this series is a  long one reading is powerful and knowledgeable조회수 뭐임sunfishman this trailer really makes it

create this intro pleasecan i just say i love the main character in this story he literally could of saved everyone in the cabin but instead he killed all the eggs on his own so he could kill one guy he didn’t likethis is not a yaoi rightare they planning on putting  episodes in to this because i’ve read the the first few and i need this in my life i haven’t read the novel but i really hope this web tune will end up being super longlets make this highest liked webtoon video in webtoon channeli’m reading this and the last episode we have to wait for  days what the fujsiskxkslakz i’m just kidding but it does take  days in order to read the last episode because it takes long to make a webtoon so i understandi already finished reading the whole  webnovel chapters what a ridethere were some points where i thought this is getting repetitive that its cliche cheesy cringe and i considered to drop it several timesbut i continue reading just like how kim dokja faithfully reads ways of survival and i gradually fell in love with it the unique plot the characters i love how well written they arealso the ending really got my heart a very proper one imodefinitely recommend it to anyone who read this commentyes to you the reader just as i am a reader toofor reference it is said that this webtoon is preparing to produce about hundreds of animations scheduled to be produced in  movies and drama  seasonscommon guys u got goosebumps while watching this didnt u~~well atleast i didi have been reading the novel for  days straight and its damn good currently on chapter omniscient readers viewpointomniscient readers viewpoint if his dad wasnt abusive aaaa i can’t wait to see how the future events in the novel will actually lookthis needs to be animelooks solid af  i will give it a chanceconstellation the watcher of light and darkness is smiling at youomg all of the main characters are in this scene omg dude i was here when the trailer was just out and it already has  million viewers less than a month thats awesome this webtoon is literally something its truly deserves it when is the anime version coming outi would love to see this as a animei underestimated the power of this webtoon now i am hooked to it😍hm~ another one was added to the list now ill just wait for a reincarnator adaptation sobsgood storyand i was quietly staring at that scenehappy  million views （＾◇＾）i am already reading this webtoon and i hadnt seen its trailer yetthe trailer is even more freaking awesome than the webtoonthis is gonna be the next solo leveling and when it does im gonna be the one of the few people to say that i was part of the og fam note part of the og manhwa fan btw i havent read the novel since im a kid so i cant pay for the chapters 😞😞that trailer give me goosebumpsand this kids is why you should read booksso they finally made it into webtoonthis is gayone of the best things is that the mc won’t be in a romantic relationship so the shippers can go crazy but not having romance also is one of the best thing about itthe novel is a masterpiece webtoon had just came out a month or so ago and i’m here anticipating for an anime to be made i very much expected there to be one after the webtoon but i know making webtoon and animes are hard work so i will wait patientlyeditactually now that they had decided to have omniscient reader will they also translate the manhuawebtoon for the trash of the count’s family i really hope they do  i know that there’s a korean manhuawebtoon but i don’t know koreani hope they will have it on webtoon but then the novel is incomplete right now and i think webtoon only picks up completed novels okay i’m just going to wait and hopewhere can i read this besides webtoonauthornim so how many times are you going to diekim dokja yesas a reader of the light novel i will only say one thingthe story of omniscient reader viewpoint is a paradox at some point i was asking a question similar to is the egg born before the chicken or is the chicken born before the eggits hereeeeeeeeeeeeeee finally cant wait until the comics go with  chaps itd be epicwould you like to use the stigma the absolute majority of constellations in the channel are feeling immense joythe constellation ‘prisoner of the golden headband’ is pulling out his hair in excitementthat dude needs to get a hair cut smhspoilerssun wukong too opjokes aside the art seems goodso the anime adaptation comes out whenthis man looks a lot like jin woo and his scenario is also very similar 🤔😂highly recommend you read the light novel that the webtoon is based on i’m pretty sure it’s completed too 👍👍👍endgame and infinity war are tremblingkim dokja you fucking bastard 😂😂 literally this is the best novel ive ever read i was overwhelmed for weeks when i finished you cant predict anything the characters developement everything is insane 💕✔️this is exactly what i wished whenever i finished reading a novel i wanted to enter the world of a story😂 for example i imagined myself as a wizard in the wizarding world of harry potter hahahathis trailer is in my opinion not good no i don’t wish to back that up with observations or facts i simply had a negative reaction to it and it made me want to pass on what could easily be a good piece of mediathe trailer is epic its like an animation movie 🤩it says from the studio that brought you solo leveling but webtoon doesn’t have solo leveling 🤔i put my high hope that in the coming future this will become a series episodes i would definitely watch it no matter what the animation were so amazing when i red the first chapter ive never been such so automatically amazed by it because i can usually sense that this is a spectacular storyline unlike any other comics that takes few chapter that pirques my interest this comic is on another level must recommend for anyone out there who havent read this yet a huge regards to the authorugh as a reader of the novel im speachless dont let me down pleasei found out about the novel because of the webtoon i thought it was gonna be just another no brainer read to pass boredom and i couldnt fathom why  chapters long chapters in and i was still invested chapters in and i was crying chapters in and im freaking wailinga must read with a steady plot great plot twists and very loveable and round characters im so excited for the webtoony u r i s or b l s pleaseimagine if they made this into an animei’m reading this at nightcan anyone explain to me how this has so many dislikes any drama going on or is pretty much one of the best novels and webtoons of this type with decent amount of chapters right now so whyi wont be suprised if crunchyroll turns this into an anime too once it gets enough episodesi mean this trailer had really good quality and animationbut for now lets focus on the comic and novel shall weew weeb stuffi downloaded webtoon for thisthis should be an animei hope this is how they animate the whole series of they make a animated versionits actually really good i invested into reading this all night lits getting so much views im cryiinngggthis story looks like it will get animated and if yes i couldnt be more happierwtf is even going on here with the random ass body shotsjust knowing what’s going to happen already changes the future not by much but it still changes iti think he and the novels mc will

the son of god according to the bible all christians who recognize jesus as the son of god are able to be savedread about jesus’ death on the cross to understand salvation in the bible god sends jesus to earth so that he can die and absolve humanity of original sindevote yourself fully to god in everything you do if your confuse just do this if you want to be saved do this repent  know that you are a sinner  believe  that christ  died for you for your sins  and that god raised him from the dead  on the third day  if you believe it  with all your heart all your soul and all your mind you will be saved by  the holys of holys  amen 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏theres a reason why this is the most popular webnovel in south korea the mc is not an op character but hes clever and way more charismatic hes also a strategist using the knowledge he knows in the novel hes not an emotionless robot or a killing machine side characters are not just there to be amazed by the mc theyre actually strong too on their own they are lovable there is no plot armor you know what that meanscharacter deaths the plot might be about survival and you think its the same for many others no its not you would be surprised so stop comparing this to a power fantasy like solo levelling as much as i love that manga because who hates an op mc honestly this far surpasses solo levelling because everyone has a mysterydislikeepici’m am so confused with this can someone explainthis comic is amaizngthere’s a lot more chapters on manga readersolo leveling got the webtoon game on smashtrust me this is really goodthis looks absolutely

webtoon you hit a big onelineマンガで連載してるけどこれも、webtoonだったんかif the “three ways to survive the apocalypse “ was an actual story then this came out that would’ve been amazing too lolthere’s more chapters on a another webs btwi wished this happened to me but instead i get reincarnated as another person and live a fantasy world like in a anime novel or showread the novel loved itliteral chills ´；ω；｀yes yes

gets an anime broooo please make it an animethis webtoon is new but already shining im gonna stay with it though all episodes till the end and then cry my eyes out for another great webtoon endingi underestimated this webtoon but it is a must readwaw 😌💅i wonder if this gets an anime adaptationthis is like the pure result to any weeb who wants attack on titan to happen irlthey want to be with levi ackerman이제 영어로 회차를 시작하겠다i’ve already started reading it i’m a chapter uriel best girlso they have time to make a new one but not add to solo levelingsomeone please make this an animewebtoon only has up to chapter  so far though and only up to chapter  for freeyou know that on other websites this webtoon has like  more chapters than on the actual appdang webtoon is really stepping up the game with these new trailersread the novel they saidit’ll be fun they saidno joke it’s actually pretty good i’m only  chapters in but damn it’s a novel that i truly enjoywho else here from the adthis is at  chapters online for free don’t waste ur time in webtoon waitingits like the neverending story but betteri knew it they had something similarlookie lookie there is now three jinwoosς◉⌓◉’ that looks so cool omgbrought to you by creators of solo levelingye it’s so tuff i slept on it for a bit cuz i was mad they stop workin on solo levelinghehe fools who use webtoon fear my power of illegal online reading in which there is already  chapters not the puny only a matter of time until we start getting literal animated webtoons webtoongif hype gonna be strongyesss the webtoon is here im getting hyped kyyaaawhy is there only  chapters when theres actually  or morei hope the mc doesn’t get powers like his only ability is that he knows what’s going to happen or maybe he also has some other power but it doesn’t boost any of his base attributes or stats if you’re a gamerreading a book mustve never felt so exciting huhi don’t dont know how they do it but the promotional video always makes the webtoon seem worse then it isi was actually avoiding this webcom but nowthink ima check it ouuuutthis new premise has become a rising gem it reminds me of “my new life as a villainess” and “scumvillain’s selfsaving system” in the awareness of our main character but it presents this main character as starting as a reader and taking up the role of hero immediately without being placed in the mind of an antagonist i’m greatly considering itthat was the worst trailer in the worldthis looks sooooo goood i gotta read thisyea it’s rlly good so fari am completely compelled to read thishe look like sun jin wooyou should read i am just reading it it is a mustit would hilarious if he just failed and that’s thatis this solo player prequelif this were made into an anime and made right this

today and its firethe art alonei fucking love this noveli feel like were actually dokja cuz cmoni was reading iti thought it was a manhwayeah i can tell the story is way better than solo leveling currently reading the light novel if it keeps up this is gonna be one of the best webtoonsget ready guys you in one hell of a ride dohhhhhhthaaats super coool i fcking knew it was the same something creator whateverso basically a prologue or an alternate universe of only i level upwhenever i meet a weeb outside or on internet i make sure to recommend this gem like you gotta read this shit right nowits like ripoff version of solo levellingwhen you read it for the free coins but you actually get hooked to the storythat ending gave me chillswhat the hell the trailer is so beautiful aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhafter reading orv in webnovel and webtoon medium _now i want to watch this as a high quality anime_ sobs dokja 😢😢😢😢this was actually a manhwa before it was even on webtoon you can read it on a website called webtoonxyzalso it is up to like chapter this is gonna be a great webtoon the light novel is a masterpiece in my opinion can’t wait to see it webtoonizedthe manga not being finished made me read the novel  but now i don’t know who is who when someone is talking and i get confused~this is why i’m better off with reading the manga but its not finished    ~~it is quite gooddamn i just noticed if this was animated it would look so goodthis is a great read i do recommend you read it if you haven’tcamecan out during sunmmeri’m still on webtoon because of inordinary remember when it first came out so long agoi would go against reading it to anyone its confusing if you dont know korean history and the ending is very disappointingseems interesting  i might look into itliterally read this  days agothis is no longer animated images by god this is an anime trailer yo when are we gonna get  everyone else is a returneei read some of the episodes already and they’re amazingi bet he wrote it for himself from the futurei wish animes existence was just fictionwhy did i get logged out my account the novel is really good toodad reading is powerme so you read it toguys its not a webtoon original comic thats why its actually goody’all remember when this was on reaperscans lol can’t wait to readwhen you already read the novel and your exited for the web toon alright give me all the spoilers nowwords cannot explain my excitement for this right nowwith webtoon getting anime’s this will be a great one for sure i’m already hookedit was an interesting novel i didn’t like it but you mightbetttman i read the novel a way back since it came out and i was mind blown by how good it was  now we get the comic version the comic does justice to the novel although some parts are missing because the novel itself has a lot of exposition but they make it up with the art like the background is really important like the background of the art comes back as really important stuff definitely a new experience just like it was meant to be i am happy for the comic versionthis looks pretty coolyeet i’ve been injecting this straight into my veins for the past month and a halfomg is anyone else excited to ship dokja and jonghyuk🥺 their relationship is probably the most developed out of all of them in the novel and its so cute🥰also pls dont hate on this comment😢this is a very promising webtoonyo the animation is opi just noticed the mc looks like jin woo from solo levelingso why is solo leveling not on webtoondefinitely recommendehhh this is a webtoon i read it at zeroscans better check it out  on the webtoon app might have more chapts nvm it’s at chapter  zeroscans is at like  they haven’t uploaded any new chapters so maybe webtoon bought the series from themi thought this was from the solo leveling people it had that art style so far it’s pretty goodwebtoon really is trying to push the ysa fl agenda lol but ljh looks so cool in that classroom shotoh man its officially out anyways so everyone join the omniscient reader english fandom discord because the webnovel was great and the webtoon looks just as great so far and theyve opened up a discussion area for webtoon only readers so you can talk about what happens as the chapters get releasedrip reaperscans they have my respect and i hope webtoon doesn’t make the redraws shit pls don’t do this to us againi thought the thumbnail was deku and iida from mha but holy damn this looks sicktime to see the greatest bromance in history in art formhype hype hype i just picked up the novel and mwah the flavori already started this on a different site but what the hell are those last chapter never seen that beforei started reading this comic because of the free coin event and i swear am not regretting 😍🔥this webtoon is ❤︎ beautiful ❤︎solo leveling is such a good webtoon so this should be great as wellanyone not gonna mention that same artist also drew solo leveling its very obvious thoughtthis is actually a pretty well written story so far you cant really predict what is going to happen next the mc is not exactly the mc of this story which will make you think what the hell is going on here and trust me when i say this they actually make this dynamic work excited to see how this story goeswhen i saw solo leveling i screamed and now it is my duty to read this before i diedi never thought i’d see the day webtoon puts a systemesque manhwa on its platform i assumed it’d never happen but then again with solo levelling they’d probably  want to get in on it hopefully they’ll put more web novel adapted manhwas on their platform it’d be nice if they were a bit more mainstreamlove the art style since its from the same studio that made solo levelingyall this is the best fucking novel i ever read please give it a read before checking out the web toon it’s on webnovelwhy im crying watching this yazzzz finallyconstellation  demon king of salvation is smiling from abovegood shit read the novel toowhat in the name of off brand sung jin woo is thiswhere are the animators😭if you havent read this yet i recommend it % the story is absolutely mindblowing and i say with complete seriousness that this will probably become one of my favorite webtoons on another note i do recommend reading the novel for that extra experience but im really curious to see how this story will turn out as a webtooni cant wait im so glad this got an adaption wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwget ready to cry peoplethis gave me solo leveling vibeswaitdid i just see bamthis is such an amazing webtoon the art is gorgeousi was just about to read the novel until this came up and my mind went must read this is so excitingdamn i got goosebumps because the background music was intense 😳 it is a must read ✨just a heads upfor those of you interested in reading the novel please give it a try as well its really good and it was one of the first novels that got me into light novels in the first place the novel was just recently completed too so you can go ahead and binge read it as well there is a lot of world and character building and watching yoo jonghyuks and dokjas relationship development as well as character though id prefer not to spoil it is going to be a nice treat for those of you interested in isekai genres dont mind an op protagonist or prefer a protagonist thats down to earth i highly recommend this trash of the counts family an ongoing fantasy novel with lots of world building and character dynamics and the sclasses i raised which has a similar yet different concept compared to orv with a protagonist thats trying to save his little brother these are the novels i started with and its also what got me into light novels in the first place please have a look at themi literally cried for an hour or so from happiness when i heard there would be a manghwa about omniscient readers viewpoint っ˘̩╭╮˘̩っi highly rate this manhwa i have been a huge fan of the light novel and have read the whole thing and with the solo leveling art it will be amazingwebtoon turn this into an anime you wont regret the decision and hire descent voice actorseditalso webtoon should really add solo leveling  to their web series collectioncoolthe artwork is absolutely amazing and this webtoon is my favourite you cant change my mindyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaaassssssssssfinally it got the

greater than solo levelling tomb raider king sao log horizon hello world dungeon seeker tales of demons and gods the live etc according to me its the best story i have ever read so far legit😮so far the best webtoon trailer i’ve seeni was waiting for this trailer since i started itfact the same who drew solo leveling is now drawing this webtooni love it i just came back from reading solo leveling and saw this as a recommendationthis is good and all but when is solo leveling coming to webtoon 😭😭bon aller jle call ça va être un des meilleurs webtoonthis is so goodcant express how happy i was when i first heard that line webtoon got the localization of omniscient readers viewpoint and not a similar website that have some paywall or some shizz 👀 more ppl get to read orv for free i hope they also license trash of the counts family ughhhhhhh the thoughts of my two faves getting the recognition feels good 💕better than most trailers 😂👌damnnnn best trailer ive ever seenabrooo this would be an amazing animei’m feeling a solo leveling vibe from thiswebtoon just hyped this up so fricking muchimagine how meta it would be if this was the webtoon in the webtoonal pareacer soy la única que habla

gonna read thisi just finished reading the first few episodesive followed the novel this was perhaps one of the greatest novels ive read of course the protagonist is a cheat in his own way but the world still would kick him down any time he pushes past his boundaries there were tons of character developments the worldbuilding was phenomenal theres really nothing much you can ask of it maybe if it had been longer i guess have fun with the webtoon version read it to the end you wont regret iti cant be the only one who thinks this is almost as good as those marvel trailers xdthe problem is this webtoon has  translated chapters already but on webtoon it has  with fast pass no one would pay for old chapters just release all the available chapters then people would read it on your website or it would be the same as diceomg i still cant believe its on webtoon now yessswhen will they make a trailer for antistalkerphasemom im sorry back to youkillmaxread it its amazing didnt think much of

really read novel specially korean ones but i must say orv is an amazing wellcreated story from all the mangas or novel i have read never i feel so confused with the plot and stuff yet feeling hungry to know what happens next and keep reading as if its something that must be read the ending was unexpected for me even tho a friend of mine who introduce me to it has giving a few big spoilerswhcih i asked them to since i need spoiler to keep reading i never seen a novelmanga with an ending like that an ending that makes you feel as if you are the of the storyi just finished reading chapter to me it felt like the theatre owner is the author of the novel because he blushed when dokja pierced through his forehead after entering dokjas mind memories where he saw the texts of the novelthis is probably the best official webtoon trailer i see props its intriguing straight to the point intense and sells the story for exactly what it is very nicewill get animation or something 😁a song that really suits this webtoonnovel isrokudenashi one voice good luck to fellow readersthis needs to be an anime so would without a doubt be way better than some of the main stream ones that are popular atm reading the novel then the comic make it even more impactful cant imagine how bad ass the fire dragon scene would be not to mention the other disastersyeah im just a readercoolwow i am reading this manga nowim dying of curiousity what actually is kim dokja what is that one thing even we as readers are still unaware ofthe contellation conie recommends everyone to read this piece of arti read

webtoon gets to lolbro im bawling my eyes outi hope this comic become animeyoo joonghyuk who are youlee jihye gasps in korean master he is obviously the love of your lifei came expecting copper but holy shit i found a gem mine i literally thought its your typical action comic containing all the tropes youd find in the book and now im reading what couldve be one of the best webnovels to grace this dark planettruly one of the bestwhen we say you guys are not ready trust us for what is about to come your jaws are about to fall and fall hardto the ppl who doesnt ship jungheok x dokja and say dokja x sooyoung or dokja x sangah is better just imagine jungheok was a girl then yall wouldnt have spent a sec to ship themyour double standards are showing homophobic ehi love dokjai have read solo leveling and many adventure webtoon however i must say omniscient reader is my favorite one it gave me great feeling so much emotion happy and sad love and hates rather than just fight and fight i also love the development of support characters and the best part is the chemistry between kim dokja and yoo jong huyk hahai am yoo junghyeokreading omniscient reader’s viewpoint was the best decision i’ve ever made i seriously love it so muchwill this getting animatedi never really enjoy reading an action fantasy manhwa but this series got me fixated with my phone for the whole chapters so farfor days straighti never feel so curious about a story because i cant guess what will happen nextkim dokja is unpredictable and i love iti love youi shouldve read this much earlier but i think im not that late too so far so great im currently on chapter on its webtoon and im so excitedoh god i just feel bad for the people who can’t see the actual novel i shouldn’t compare works but honestly this is the best novel i’ve read since harry potter it really feels like there’s a person named dokja out there how the authorsthe novel writers shing and shong carry out the plot is amazing it’s not just the plot how they describe the scenes and the raw emotions is beyond art believe me it’s the best thing i’ve read so far and the webtoon is good tooim coming back again lmaosince it has a vibe from re zero so i like it even morei read the light novel and all i can say is perfect periodwhat happened to this and the solo levelling anime tuyệt vời hi vọng ra phimlol their is also novelsheesh is it been already year damnthe moving images made me realize how amazing this would be as an animated series with the samesimilar artstylehonestly its a damn good webtoon like seriously it has such an intricate plot so guys please stop comparing this to manhwas like solo leveling although i dont hate solo leveling it has a simple storyline but the thing is the side characters get overlooked a lot and the existence of gods and monsters and other worlds felt shoehorned and that makes up for an unsatisfying ending while on the other hand omniscient reader has a complex story amazing character development and main character kim dokja doesnt punch his way out of every situation like sun jinwoo no dokja uses his knowledge of this new world he makes use of his party members he always has a plan and thats the thing like about him the most honestly this webtoon deserves more attention now again that said i am not in any way saying that solo leveling is inferior to orv i have read solo leveling believe me it was a very entertaining read but what orv does is it takes some of the elements from sl fills in the stuff that sl was missing and makes it much enjoyable would recommend ohhthis has a trailerto everyone who finished the novel what kind of ending do you want😭this is best novel ive ever read highly recommendonly later does he realize he creates entire universe as a dream and the dream becomes reality while he becomes the godwoahhlistening to mitski while reading novel chapter was the best thingmade me so hypedplease make this into a good extremely well animated anime ufotable or someone else hugehypeewait what he didnt wanted to change the ending he just helping people who didnt survive in the novel when i searched it said that there will be a movie but its impossible to cover that much important things in a movie manwha too seems to be not ending soon enough i hope its anime seriesthe story make my day but the ending ruin my daywow it looks dope as heckfirst ever manhwa that made me read the novel guess what didnt regret anything man u dont have any idea how crazy i am for kdj 😌🖤✨✨han sooyoung my wifewhat are the authors official accountsgilyeon is worthydokja world domination 🛐cant help but compare how the mc and his coworker lady look similar to the mc and the first healer lady of solo leveling offcourse the plots of both novels are like hell and heaven totally different this felt like it came from an avengers movie trailer oly frick im getting goosegumpswhy is there a manhwa in a webtoon channelorv is absolutely amazing i read the whole novel a few months ago and am uptodate with the webtoon the story plot is very different from the normal mc read the novel and becomes op trope the way the mysteries of the many characters converge into a single twist is absolutely genius definitely an amazing readlove this one give it a try you wont regretreading this webtoon and the novel is probably the greatest thing ive done in my entire lifeand then he realizes that he is the oldest dreammost ancient dreamこれさめっちゃ面白い…！！！！日本語版の小説出てくれないかな…単行本もほしい…翻訳して読むのって意外と疲れるし…✨ d e p r e s s i o n ✨ as a comic huehhh sayangkudokja bau mayadthis novel takung reader and bromance and tsundere to the whole new levelيا جمعه متى رح ينزل قولوا بسرعه رجاً o friday when is it going to come down say quickly pleasei had read the manhwa first before finishing the novel and goddamn orv manhwa now feels way different after all those chapters of the novel my perception of the manhwa as i was reading it for the first time was how refreshing it was and plot is packed af now ive finished the novel manhwas atmosphere became heavy its not like the manhwa failed to capture the angst of the novel it was my expectations who failed me for not noticing the angst beforehand lolif i continue to regress will i ever get to meet you againi know im late about it but its actually so funny when he says im just a reader hes also saying his own name xdi like the novel especially the dokja character 😘❤아 전지적 독자 시점이구나ㅋㅋgod i watched this trailer in an ad a year ago and i was like wow this looks like generic garbage one year later im chapters in when i realized this trailer was for the webtoon adaptation of orvthis is one of the best web toons i have read in the past year tog got too complicated and muggy whereas this is fun to the point and surprisingim % sure that no one can hurt me anymore thx orvpainful screachjust a random comment damn hope they make this master piece into an anime just like solo levelingthe best fiction novel everokay but it is hard for me not to be scared that this is a other way the story will spread and then the hell will start i wonder if it is just in korea or in all the worldi almost done the novel i only have two things to say one im depressed and two this is a masterpiece전지적 독자 시점은 웹 소설도 재밌지es tan hermoso que voy a llorari finally reread it and i have realized a lot something that i never realize when i first read itthis story is for just that one readerwebtoon you need to drop a physical version of the manwha because it is % true to the novel’s content istg the novel is amazing it never fails to make me cry and laugh and the art is amazing just take my money 😫masterpiece thats what orv is honestly one of my favorite webtoons bc the story is so interestingspoiler tagdokja is a great role model for gilyoungbest ln i have seen hands downreading the novels ending while listening to cold plays everglow made me cry like a riveri love dokja sm😫 i cry everytime i remember the noveli have lovehate relationship to masterpieces like this 😭 ive just know about the epilogue of this webtoon in its webnovel and its just wholesome and sad at the same time for me the type of story that you know that its super amazing but wholesomely broke your heart at the same time 😭i love how the true substance of this story isnt something like wish fulfillment op mc with corny romance and power fantasy hype despite being under the systemapocalypse themethe story is incredible albeit painfully slow burn and theres no telling what happensthe charm doesnt only stick and revolve around the mc and the side characters dont feel onedimensional and actually progresses on and off screen theres no pandering or delay in each chapter and story progression is real here every mystery is unfolded throughout the story and plot holes are properly concluded i truly appreciate plotcentric stories like this literal goldfor whoever still doubt whether to read this webtoon or no you must read it it is so greatt you wont regret it i already read the webtoon version ongoing & novel finished english translated🤩🤩🤩🤩its really the best thing ive ever read🤩😆😆😆😭💙💙💙💙💙im just a reader soo badass 😍one of

are totally different the only similarity i can see is the art style both are slow burn in term of progress from the beginning but become stronger after point and pretty consistent to the end sl plot is mediocre thus easy to understand whereas orv plot is complex sl has straightforward attack description of action that led immediate impact whereas orv has multiple attack engagements with world historyrelated that may require a bit of thinking before the impact of any action sl gaming system is only applicable to mc that powers by an entity whereas orv apply streaming system to all characters powers by fablestory sl reaches international popularity due to webtoon hype whereas orv has gained international high recognition with webnovel however i find myself able to engage more with orv due to the characters and worldbuilding especially towards kim dokja i resent and support him happy and cry for him empathize and sympathize with him altogether at the same time is that girl in white with short hair han sooyoungthe demon king of salvation is silently watchingi highly recommend reading the novel worth it글로벌 우리장르 자랑스럽다just finished the novel and i feel so damn sadbest webtoonjonna saranghemassive spoileri think that han sooyung and kim dokja is the canon ship here theres this underlying meaning on how sooyung would write a novel only for one person to read and that is kim dokja and dokja even accepted han sooyungs proposal of reading her novel dokja even suggested for its genre to be romance romance with kim dokja even warning her that if he read her novel he might complain that hes picky that he would always bug her with comments and that it is possible that he would bug her for more chapters to which han sooyung is really glad since thats what han sooyung has been searching for han sooyung was jealous of tls wont spoil who that is but those who read until final will know because tls got kim dokja who would always comment on every single chapter and she really wanted someone like kim dokja too if this story can really save you then ill keep writing the epilogue for you until the end of time for eternity this basically shows that she is willing to give her entirety to him for all eternity for the last chapters all she has been doing is writing all day and all night in hopes of saving kim dokja shes willing to give her time for all eternity to kim dokja and she was the one who basically saved him han sooyung literally saved him in more ways than one with even saving kim dokja before the start of everything there is a paradox within this context readers will know is it not obvious just how much han sooyung means to kim dokja and how much kim dokja means to han sooyung they are literally made for each other the beginning and the end from before everything started how everything started from the start every moment and until the conclusion han sooyung saved kim dokja and kim dokja saved han sooyung kim dokja agreeing to be her reader means he would dedicate everything of him to her for all eternity as kim dokja said he is just a reader and this really shows everything about himhe is a reader by becoming han sooyungs reader hes basically dedicating his entirety to her and theyre both constellations they can literally be with each other forever han sooyung would write for kim dokja for all of eternity and kim dokja would dedicate all of himself as a reader for han sooyung for all of eternity honestly theyre absolutely perfect together absolutely in the last chapters even it was all because of han sooyungs longing for kim dokja that they were able to save kim dokja which was supposed to be impossible she dedicated dedicated her humanity to kim dokja her everything to him and kim dokja also lived and was saved because of her dedicating his all being han sooyungs reader for all of eternity just for her this is absolutely love it may even be the truest love ive ever seen they dedicate everything of themselves to each other for all of their ■■ eternityhey webtoon readers if u didn’t know this is a novel adaptation so yeeeah read that tooi dont know if anyone commented on this yet but im liking the bits of animation in this trailershould i read the webnovel i already read the raws and im so hypedd and does anyone know where to read the webnovel for freecant wait to see yoo sangah in black chinese dress 😌👌if this was an anime it would get anime of the yearvba anyone plz tell me who is thr guy shown in in this trailer i really wanna knowthis story is a rollercoaster of emotionsorv is one of the best ln i ever read so im sure its going to be be a amazing ride oh i hope they dont make dokja gay in thisyeah the story better than solo lvelingdokja is my favorite characteri just started reading this at the very beginning of this month may and it’s become one of my ultimate favorites already it’s so mwahwhyd it keep saying hes the only reader he never thought that hes just the only one to finish reading itim up to volume in the novel and i have to say this is one of the best stories i have read in a long time you seriously wouldnt regret reading it the way dokja uses his knowledge of the story and adjusts to scenes he never expected are so impressiveguys do you know that dokja독자 means reader in korean so the title of this novel is omniscient reader view point 전지적 독자 시점will there be an animedamn this trailer is some another level shiti am just waiting for biyuujust finished reading the webnovel and i must say orv was the best novel ive ever read in my whole life i felt so empty alr and i dont usually reread a story but now id like to read it again orv made me appreciate reading a story to know diff povs of the characters i cant wait to read the upcoming chapters in webtoon too ❣️i recommend this so badly its so good read it i beg you you wont regret itits a mix of fantasy action and comedy i thought webtoon doesnt allow blood scenes 우리 독자 너무 잘생겼지 않음there are three ways to survive the apocalypse but that doesnt mean that only three people can survivei hope webtoon version give this series a happy family side story our lovely squid dokja constellations deserve ittt 😭my dokjaa oh my god yeess this series got me hooked ay the first episode it is amazing and how he usus his knowdlege오 네이버 웹툰 영어판이 사이트가 있구나 근데요 전부다 무료네 뭐지김독자가 맛있고 중혁이가 만든 음식이 멋있는 그 웹툰소설okay but was this inspired from the japanese drama alice in borderlandi have read the webtoon but the plot is same for both survival games its just aib is more gore amd horror and this is scifiokay soo i calculated for how many years it will take for the manhwa to finishthere are a total of chapters in the novel week chapter month chapters year chaptersso chapters chapters a year years years x days total days to finishand i didnt include other variables that may affect the number of chapters made eg months of hiatus and that theyll shortencut some scenes from the novel so that they can catch up and wont take too long to be completedso maybe the estimated years to finish will be about years at least because the artist needs to take hiatus to prepare for the next season and also if theres any accidents or health issuesdamn thats long but ill wait because im so excited to see it drawnthis novel is completely different from the rest it is truly a whole new level of novel in the novel is full of elements and believe me you wont be able to guess what will happen next and have you ever tried to imagine yourself in a series where you are not the main character and this series of novels will satisfy you it is very worth to read ita few chapters in and im already going crazy this is so damn good good doesnt even begin to explain how good it isprepare your tissues in advancethus the ugliest king was bornim a new reader of the webtoon but i am curious as to why huiwon isnt famous among the characters i mean i really love her character and i actually ship her with dokja😭am i the only onebtw should i wait for the manhwa or should i read the novellike very much this serie ☺️when you like this so much it feels like you were became a certain constellation hungry for the story for this shit offif this doesnt get animated in the next years or something i swear im ready to fightmerinding gila ngeliat trailernya this story has a lot of ■■■ our protagonist would get ■■■ and be ■■■ there are many fun characyers like yjh the ■■■ who is also ■■■ and an annoying character named h■■ who will be the protagonists ■■■paradox among paradox imoive been reading the noveland it legitimately makes you cry at timesits so goodits been a few months since ive read the novel and im still getting chillsi fking love this bookimagine if this gets an anime adaptation would probably take the world by storm ✨👏🏻who are youim just a reader and im the only one who knows the end of this worldi really hope this gets an anime or dramaguys how do you make such good content what the fuckk im so excitedits been so long since ive finished the novel and ngl im still feeling empty whenever im missing dokja every now and then lmao imagine being so attached to a man who doesnt exist in your world line 🤡🤡oh es sorprende el número de visitas del vídeo ya entiendo porque es tan famoso en inglésthe dislikes are from sl simps vdokja im just a readerme that is what im going to say if every comic from webtoon or manga become real why the heck she smiling at him🔊relationship alert🔊the light novel reader will be like kim dokja while talking to manhwa readers lololwhats the name of the song used in the trailerahhh goosebumps잘 만들었잖아 🥰esse manhwa é perfeitoaahhh kim dokja uwaahhthis is way better than solo leveling the only thing why solo leveling is so popular right now is because the artthe more i read this the more it feels like one of those soulless cultivation manhuas where the mc gets more and more op and crushes his opposition easily with little effort when i first started reading this i thought there would be some depth to the story given how the confrontation with the statues played out but right now its not anything like that there doesnt seem to be any struggle or deep thoughts or philosophy in the story just constant power ups except for the mc all the other characters are very forgettable due to how one dimensional they are and it seems the mc is rapidly turning one dimensional and forgettable as well its almost impossible to be emotionally invested in this story unlike in a good shounen like naruto or one piece solo leveling didn’t even get popular until the mahwa come out and become a huge hit while orv is already popular before the mahwa come out that’s the differenti love the webtoon hopefully the anime is gonna be goodive just been simping on kim dokja and jung heewon all the timefinallyoh kim dokja fans of the webtoon and webnovel theres an omniscient reader community on amino httpaminoappscomcomniscient_reader_amino 👌one fact wrong mc is not the only reader but he is the only reader that finished reading itdokja is lowkey sung jin wooprobably the best book ive readthe animation so good the animation is way better than the

was teleported into the world of the series which is my favorite genre isekai is the name of the genre so going to read thiswhat is with the dislikesyou guys cannot tell me that the mc from omniscent reader doesnt look like the young distant cousin of the mc from solo levelling nobody can change my mind👁👄👁this is the type of comic that keeps u on ur toes and makes u fall flat on ur face for the mc i dont regret itthis deserves a full fledged anime edition i cannot get enough my mind has been blown and the art is strikingly gorgeous ｡ﾟtヮtﾟ｡ cannot wait for more updates ❤️constellation lazy webers smilesmans hacking irlthis is better than solo leveling it hits in korea so hard always # this aint a adult manhwano gonna lie i got some chill when he said he can change the ending ouf this manhwa is crazyone of the best thing about this novel is that it indicates this story being passed to sing n song the real author of this webtoon by the op of this story which actually leaves you in the edge with this strong feeling of the apocalypse being real that this whole webtoon is a real happening and one of us could be mcs reincarnation존나 좋쿤fuckin yeahabout time it seems the best novel in history came with a webnovel hell yeaheu decido ver do que é o manhwa aí vejo issoit looks like a real anime intro hahahahahahahahahhaa love your comradeship coins has been sponsoredcant wait for king of a kingless world arc and every arc after that lmaoalso sooyoung dokja 😳와 조회수 미쳤네 가슴이 웅장해진다giving me the sweet home vibesnoat first i thought it was good but i was wrong it is the beststill can’t believe kaidou gave into the dark reunioni hope crunchyroll will make this an anime😁anyone please tell me kim dokja is a gay or noti hope no but only one thing is certain thati will survivei love this webtoon so muchim think that this incredible webtoon should have an animeabii nerden izlerim bunu yardım edin mangasını okuyorum şu anthe best part about this webtoon is that everyone thinks dokja is gaylove this webtoonaha the most ancient dreamthe webnovel of this is one of the best things ive ever read it was simply amazing for me전독시는 어디에서나 전설이다this webtoon is the perfect example of 🤣🤣reasons why this is a mustread webtoonthe entire freaking plot is so badass that you wont be able to handle it 😁mc dokja is the most savage protagonist you ever gonna meet 😇tons of other reasons are there too but my hands ache from typing but i promise you you wont ever regret clicking fight like a reader~dokjaomnisient reader is very different from some other manhwas or novels like every boys admire mc and every girls fall in love to mc every side characters have their own story and own development their are many genres in this story fantasy apocalypes comedy survival tragedy action and even little bromance just for humor omnisient readers mc is not overpowered character his only adventage is that he knows all the original story so he has to solve the difficult situation just with his knowledge however he tries to change the story since the original story is full of tragedy and failness and this makes really interesting story i highly recommand to read this both the webtoon and the novel its plot is awesome and all characters are great the novels english translation is quite awful but its okay to read iti read this on another site and i honestly just can’t wait for morebe aware of the king of ugly he will speed run this apocalypse with a simple novelwhen mc isnt the mc what the hellbruhh i already read this but😑 this is my first time watching this so its giving me a goosebumps😱☺️hahhahahahha😁so when are you gonna do a trailer for eleceedi just hope there will be no romance in thisour kim dokja is so handsome~spoilerthis trailer the last panel is that the th scenario the arkĺittive been thinking abt this for some time now to novel readersarent we all the most ancient dream rather than a constelation since hsy basically wrote orv and the ending of the epilouge was left to be ambigious leaving us to use our own imagination on what we think the ending is basically dreaming about itwell turns out he isn’t the only reader lol peak homoerotic tensionnow

please tell me the name of the software used to create this intro pleasecan i just say i love the main character in this story he literally could of saved everyone in the cabin but instead he killed all the eggs on his own so he could kill one guy he didn’t likethis is not a yaoi rightare they planning on putting episodes in to this because i’ve read the the first few and i need this in my life i haven’t read the novel but i really hope this web tune will end up being super longlets make this highest liked webtoon video in webtoon channeli’m reading this and the last episode we have to wait for days what the fujsiskxkslakz i’m just kidding but it does take days in order to read the last episode because it takes long to make a webtoon so i understandi already finished reading the whole webnovel chapters what a ridethere were some points where i thought this is getting repetitive that its cliche cheesy cringe and i considered to drop it several timesbut i continue reading just like how kim dokja faithfully reads ways of survival and i gradually fell in love with it the unique plot the characters i love how well written they arealso the ending really got my heart a very proper one imodefinitely recommend it to anyone who read this commentyes to you the reader just as i am a reader toofor reference it is said that this webtoon is preparing to produce about hundreds of animations scheduled to be produced in movies and drama seasonscommon guys u got goosebumps while watching this didnt u~~well atleast i didi have been reading the novel for days straight and its damn good currently on chapter omniscient readers viewpointomniscient readers viewpoint if his dad wasnt abusive aa i can’t wait to see how the future events in the novel will actually lookthis needs to be animelooks solid af i will give it a chanceconstellation the watcher of light and darkness is smiling at youomg all of the main characters are in this scene omg dude i was here when the trailer was just out and it already has million viewers less than a month thats awesome this webtoon is literally something its truly deserves it when is the anime version coming outi would love to see this as a animei underestimated the power of this webtoon now i am hooked to it😍hm~ another one was added to the list now ill just wait for a reincarnator adaptation sobsgood storyand i was quietly staring at that scenehappy million views （＾◇＾）i am already reading this webtoon and i hadnt seen its trailer yetthe trailer is even more freaking awesome than the webtoonthis is gonna be the next solo leveling and when it does im gonna be the one of the few people to say that i was part of the og fam note part of the og manhwa fan btw i havent read the novel since im a kid so i cant pay for the chapters 😞😞that trailer give me goosebumpsand this kids is why you should read booksso they finally made it into webtoonthis is gayone of the best things is that the mc won’t be in a romantic relationship so the shippers can go crazy but not having romance also is one of the best thing about itthe novel is a masterpiece webtoon had just came out a month or so ago and i’m here anticipating for an anime to be made i very much expected there to be one after the webtoon but i know making webtoon and animes are hard work so i will wait patientlyeditactually now that they had decided to have omniscient reader will they also translate the manhuawebtoon for the trash of the count’s family i really hope they do i know that there’s a korean manhuawebtoon but i don’t know koreani hope they will have it on webtoon but then the novel is incomplete right now and i think webtoon only picks up completed novels okay i’m just going to wait and hopewhere can i read this besides webtoonauthornim so how many times are you going to diekim dokja yesas a reader of the light novel i will only say one thingthe story of omniscient reader viewpoint is a paradox at some point i was asking a question similar to is the egg born before the chicken or is the chicken born before the eggits heree finally cant wait until the comics go with chaps itd be epicwould you like to use the stigma the absolute majority of constellations in the channel are feeling immense joythe constellation ‘prisoner of the golden headband’ is pulling out his hair in excitementthat dude needs to get a hair cut smhspoilerssun wukong too opjokes aside the art seems goodso the anime adaptation comes out whenthis man looks a lot like jin woo and his scenario is also very similar 🤔😂highly recommend you read the light novel that the webtoon is based on i’m pretty sure it’s completed too 👍👍👍endgame and infinity war are tremblingkim dokja you fucking bastard 😂😂 literally this is the best novel ive ever read i was overwhelmed for weeks when i finished you cant predict anything the characters developement everything is insane 💕✔️this is exactly what i wished whenever i finished reading a novel i wanted to enter the world of a story😂 for example i imagined myself as a wizard in the wizarding world of harry potter hahahathis trailer is in my opinion not good no i don’t wish to back that up with observations or facts i simply had a negative reaction to it and it made me want to pass on what could easily be a good piece of mediathe trailer is epic its like an animation movie 🤩it says from the studio that brought you solo leveling but webtoon doesn’t have solo leveling 🤔i put my high hope that in the coming future this will become a series episodes i would definitely watch it no matter what the animation were so amazing when i red the first chapter ive never been such so automatically amazed by it because i can usually sense that this is a spectacular storyline unlike any other comics that takes few chapter that pirques my interest this comic is on another level must recommend for anyone out there who havent read this yet a huge regards to the authorugh as a reader of the novel im speachless dont let me down pleasei found out about the novel because of the webtoon i thought it was gonna be just another no brainer read to pass boredom and i couldnt fathom why chapters long chapters in and i was still invested chapters in and i was crying chapters in and im freaking wailinga must read with a steady plot great plot twists and very loveable and round characters im so excited for the webtoony u r i s or b l s pleaseimagine if they made this into an animei’m reading this at nightcan anyone explain to me how this has so many dislikes any drama going on or is pretty much one of the best novels and webtoons of this type with decent amount of chapters right now so whyi wont be suprised if crunchyroll turns this into an anime too once it gets enough episodesi mean this trailer had really good quality and animationbut for now lets focus on the comic and novel shall weew weeb stuffi downloaded webtoon for thisthis should be an animei hope this is how they animate the whole series of they make a animated versionits actually really good i invested into reading this all night lits getting so much views im cryiinngggthis story looks like it will get animated and if yes i couldnt be more happierwtf is even going on here with the random ass body shotsjust knowing what’s going to happen already changes the future not by much but it still changes iti think he and the novels mc will

if you will revolutions can begin in underground settings with secret meetings and literature dissemination lots of it revolutions then manifest into cultural and political upheaval more than a coupwell maybe size or dimensions doesnt ameays matter a coup detat or a revolution from those who suffer oppression and ruling class dictatorship begin in many cases in history with rhetoric and a heavy emphasis of dissemination ofim going to cry if the child with the crickets ends up deadimagine after finishing the manhwa the apocalypse beginsfeels soo familiarooh god 🤕👣💞🙏😭😰👽🐸help

into an animeafter reading the th chap from manwha i couldnt contain myself so i for the first time in my life started reading novel and guess what id never this decision of minethis webtoon is seriously good but horribly short i used to follow it before it got on webtoon and on webtoon it is a couple chapters behindthis is so good on godthe artwork char looks rly similar to solo leveling at first 😅is it gay tho this should become an anime if tower of god bacame one why not this anime and manga is getting destroyed by manhwa and i love it because im an manga reader i only watch few anime arise manhwabrought a whole new level to the world of sioc huhyuss im screaming hope it gets adapted into an anime and good animationthe character looks like the one at the solo levellingim not really

stuff but after starting the webtoon i was hooked ended up reading the webnovel too now im already chapters in and its only been three days its really well written and nearly every character gets their own development the worldbuilding is amazing and the story development is well paced and interesting the relationships between the characters feel very genuine and well built it doesnt feel cheap at all the story itself feels so immersive its genuinely one of the easiest thing to get into for me its been a while since ive been this hooked by a storyyall the novel constantly established how kdj was considered ugly by everyone but if i hear one comment about it in the webtoon im gonna be sitting there like bitch is you blind#noonelovesyouno se ustedes pero quiero que ya salga en

korean flatform reader and i am sure that you must read this this is hundred million down loaded in korea the legend of internet nobelhow did the webtoon grow up this fast did the author self promoted himself or just it got popular on its own solo leveling creator anyway its awsomesince it has chapters and im assuming that one episode of webtoon is one chapterone chapter a week would take ten years to finish right ksajdhksjahh ya quiero que aparezca uriel mi bebesitaaomg is this a movie teaserhey web toon i request to make the mercules seris lady bug and cat noir pleas made romantic sireasthat line im just a reader made me want to read it 😍😍😍😍is this worth reading just askingthis webtoon is going to have a whole another level of paradoxesi wish it get anime adaptationcheck out the novel too

was what all mangamanhwamanhua readers waiting for come on guysthis thing is worth readingliterally better than what i expected i highly recommend reading omniscient reader❤️❤️❤️love this webtoon ❤️❤️❤️i’m obsessed with this webtoon but i’m too broke to buy fast pass ttx who are youme im just a readeri am really liking this webtoon not gonna liebtw yall there are chapters on mangakakalot lolmy baby has an adaptationnn congratulations자랑스럽다 대한웹툰자랑스럽다 전독시자랑스럽다 싱숑omg i love this novelno puedo creer que la vea ahora como webtoon no entendere nada pero ya se la historia así que ya sabre que pasa 😂if this becomes an anime i will donate so muchbackground songthis webtoon is like exactly what ive been waiting for game like level op mc apocalypse streaming wtf its so perfect god damni am just a reader woof that hit hard 😱crunchyroll better make an anime about omniscient reader or im gonna riot man it would be dope if they make an anime about this i would love it 💙💙💙💙dokja really out here speedrunning the apocalypseat you can see that that a is shining in the bottomi wonder what that means 😏😏😏😏add back solo levelingwhat about buying the rights to solo leveling with the crunchy boys and make an adaptation insteadohhh no wonder the art style was so similardokjaagghh i love my boiiidamn straight omg the trailer looks so good i’ve read up to chapter ish on the novelsoo when solo leveling on webtooni just wanted to escape from realityyeah me tooi wanted to make my manga as webtoon which i wanted to start but i dont know how to become featured artistlol you guys are slow the english scans is already out to chapter episodes gotta find that webtooni have read the ln a while ago and its a good fricken read would recommend middle gets a little slow but its still a great readi cant wait for yjh to show upsounds really stupid not gonna lie imma go read itlook id be more willing to read it with out the trailer if you just kept patt that same people who made solo made this i would of read it % from the studio that brought you solo levelingsay no more im hookedyurrsolo leveling must be next anime adaptationnot trying to spoil anything for anyone but lee gilyoung the smol child looks more scary than what i expectedlegit gave me chillsaccept jesus as the son of god according to the bible all christians who recognize jesus as the son of god are able to be savedread about jesus’ death on the cross to understand salvation in the bible god sends jesus to earth so that he can die and absolve humanity of original sindevote yourself fully to god in everything you do if your confuse just do this if you want to be saved do this repent know that you are a sinner believe that christ died for you for your sins and that god raised him from the dead on the third day if you believe it with all your heart all your soul and all your mind you will be saved by the holys of holys amen 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏theres a reason why this is the most popular webnovel in south korea the mc is not an op character but hes clever and way more charismatic hes also a strategist using the knowledge he knows in the novel hes not an emotionless robot or a killing machine side characters are not just there to be amazed by the mc theyre actually strong too on their own they are lovable there is no plot armor you know what that meanscharacter deaths the plot might be about survival and you think its the same for many others no its not you would be surprised so stop comparing this to a power fantasy like solo levelling as much as i love that manga because who hates an op mc honestly this far surpasses solo levelling because everyone has a mysterydislikeepici’m am so confused with this can someone explainthis comic is amaizngthere’s a lot more chapters on manga readersolo leveling got the webtoon game on smashtrust me this is really goodthis looks absolutely amazing even better than some anime trailersthis has a webtoon im indefinitely reading itso good never expected it too bebro someone turn my vampire system into a webtookread italright now i have to read the legendary mechanicsolo levelingand now thisgood trailer for a changethat moment you realize your a protagonist 🔪👄🔪i tried reading the webnovel and i dropped it i guess it’s like solo leveling that had a slow start i still can’t read solo leveling until spoilerafter the mc gets the system anyway i think i should try giving the manhwa a try and then move onto the webnovel when it’s goodthis webtoon is lit i just hope is uploads sooneroh i started reading this not very long ago it was good i just got a bit board with it a couple hundred chapters inafter reading god of high school solo leveling unordinary etc i have officially found a new found love and appreciation for webtoon and korean manwha in

the weak “it’s for the meager”nii hope theres an anime for omnicient reader sweet home and hardcore leveling warrior man i just love these series so much 🥺stumbled across this one completely by accident when it just came out a few months ago love itgood job line webtoon you hit a big onelineマンガで連載してるけどこれも、webtoonだったんかif the “three ways to survive the apocalypse “ was an actual story then this came out that would’ve been amazing too lolthere’s more chapters on a another webs btwi wished this happened to me but instead i get reincarnated as another person and live a fantasy world like in a anime novel or showread the novel loved itliteral chills ´；ω；｀yes yes yes yesyesyesyes a high quality novel is desrving of a high quality webtoon which i am eternally thankful for tthis plot is like a mirror on a mirror creating an infinity sequence of mirrorsif this gets an anime broo please make it an animethis webtoon is new but already shining im gonna stay with it though all episodes till the end and then cry my eyes out for another great webtoon endingi underestimated this webtoon but it is a must readwaw 😌💅i wonder if this gets an anime adaptationthis is like the pure result to any weeb who wants attack on titan to happen irlthey want to be with levi ackerman이제 영어로 회차를 시작하겠다i’ve already started reading it i’m a chapter uriel best girlso they have time to make a new one but not add to solo levelingsomeone please make this an animewebtoon only has up to chapter so far though and only up to chapter for freeyou know that on other websites this webtoon has like more chapters than on the actual appdang webtoon is really stepping up the game with these new trailersread the novel they saidit’ll be fun they saidno joke it’s actually pretty good i’m only chapters in but damn it’s a novel that i truly enjoywho else here from the adthis is at chapters online for free don’t waste ur time in webtoon waitingits like the neverending story but betteri knew it they had something similarlookie lookie there is now three jinwoosς◉⌓◉’ that looks so cool omgbrought to you by creators of solo levelingye it’s so tuff i slept on it for a bit cuz i was mad they stop workin on solo levelinghehe fools who use webtoon fear my power of illegal online reading in which there is already chapters not the puny only a matter of time until we start getting literal animated webtoons webtoongif hype gonna be strongyesss the webtoon is here im getting hyped kyyaaawhy is there only chapters when theres actually or morei hope the mc doesn’t get powers like his only ability is that he knows what’s going to happen or maybe he also has some other power but it doesn’t boost any of his base attributes or stats if you’re a gamerreading a book mustve never felt so exciting huhi don’t dont know how they do it but the promotional video always makes the webtoon seem worse then it isi was actually avoiding this webcom but nowthink ima check it ouutthis new premise has become a rising gem it reminds me of “my new life as a villainess” and “scumvillain’s selfsaving system” in the awareness of our main character but it presents this main character as starting as a reader and taking up the role of hero immediately without being placed in the mind of an antagonist i’m greatly considering itthat was the worst trailer in the worldthis looks soo goood i gotta read thisyea it’s rlly good so fari am completely compelled to read thishe look like sun jin wooyou should read i am just reading it it is a mustit would hilarious if he just failed and that’s thatis this solo player

aahhi love this light novel so much uwuthis manhwa has like episodes outbut on webtoon its only 🤦yess its out finallyyy aathe protagonist looks like jin woo from solo levelingi’ve read this before webtoon had it manganelo readers where you ati just read it on webtoon recommendation sneak peek and omg thank youthis story is just crazyonly if solo leveling was on webtoon they would be able to

fcking knew it was the same something creator whateverso basically a prologue or an alternate universe of only i level upwhenever i meet a weeb outside or on internet i make sure to recommend this gem

trailer is so beautiful aahhafter reading orv in webnovel and webtoon medium _now i want to watch this as a high quality anime_ sobs dokja 😢😢😢😢this was actually a manhwa before it was even on webtoon you can read it on a website called webtoonxyzalso it is up to like chapter this is gonna be a great webtoon the light novel is a masterpiece in my opinion can’t wait to see it webtoonizedthe manga not being finished made me read the novel but now i don’t know who is who when someone is talking and i get confused~this is why i’m better off with reading the manga but its not finished ~~it is quite gooddamn i just noticed if this was animated it would look so goodthis is a great read i do recommend you read it if you haven’tcamecan out during sunmmeri’m still on webtoon because of inordinary remember when it first came out so long agoi would go against reading it to anyone its confusing if you dont know korean history and the ending is very disappointingseems interesting i might look into itliterally read this days agothis is no longer animated images by god this is an anime trailer yo when are we gonna get everyone else is a returneei read some of the episodes already and they’re amazingi bet he wrote it for himself from the futurei wish animes existence was just fictionwhy did i get logged out my account the novel is really good toodad reading is powerme so you read it toguys its not a webtoon original comic thats why its actually goody’all remember when this was on reaperscans lol can’t wait to readwhen you already read the novel and your exited for the web toon alright give me all the spoilers nowwords cannot explain my excitement for this right nowwith webtoon getting anime’s this will be a great one for sure i’m already hookedit was an interesting novel i didn’t like it but you mightbetttman i read the novel a way back since it came out and i was mind blown by how good it was now we get the comic version the comic does justice to the novel although some parts are missing because the novel itself has a lot of exposition but they make it up with the art like the background is really important like the background of the art comes back as really important stuff definitely a new experience just like it was meant to be i am happy for the comic versionthis looks pretty coolyeet i’ve been injecting this straight into my veins for the past month and a halfomg is anyone else excited to ship dokja and jonghyuk🥺 their relationship is probably the most developed out of all of them in the novel and its so cute🥰also pls dont hate on this comment😢this is a very promising webtoonyo the animation is opi just noticed the mc looks like jin woo from solo levelingso why is solo leveling not on webtoondefinitely recommendehhh this is a webtoon i read it at zeroscans better check it out on the webtoon app might have more chapts nvm it’s at chapter zeroscans is at like they haven’t uploaded any new chapters so maybe webtoon bought the series from themi thought this was from the solo leveling people it had that art style so far it’s pretty goodwebtoon really is trying to push the ysa fl agenda lol but ljh looks so cool in that classroom shotoh man its officially out anyways so everyone join the omniscient reader english fandom discord because the webnovel was great and the webtoon looks just as great so far and theyve opened up a discussion area for webtoon only readers so you can talk about what happens as the chapters get releasedrip reaperscans they have my respect and i hope webtoon doesn’t make the redraws shit pls don’t do this to us againi thought the thumbnail was deku and iida from mha but holy damn this looks sicktime to see the greatest bromance in history in art formhype hype hype i just picked up the novel and mwah the flavori already started this on a different site but what the hell are those last chapter never seen that beforei started reading this comic because of the free coin event and i swear am not regretting 😍🔥this webtoon is ❤︎ beautiful ❤︎solo leveling is such a good webtoon so this should be great as wellanyone not gonna mention that same artist also drew solo leveling its very obvious thoughtthis is actually a pretty well written story so far you cant really predict what is going to happen next the mc is not exactly the mc of this story which will make you think what the hell is going on here and trust me when i say this they actually make this dynamic work excited to see how this story goeswhen i saw solo leveling i screamed and now it is my duty to read this before i diedi never thought i’d see the day webtoon puts a systemesque manhwa on its platform i assumed it’d never happen but then again with solo levelling they’d probably want to get in on it hopefully they’ll put more web novel adapted manhwas on their platform it’d be nice if they were a bit more mainstreamlove the art style since its from the same studio that made solo levelingyall this is the best fucking novel i ever read please give it a read before checking out the web toon it’s on webnovelwhy im crying watching this yazz finallyconstellation demon king of salvation is smiling from abovegood shit read the novel toowhat in the name of off brand sung jin woo is thiswhere are the animators😭if you havent read this yet i recommend it % the story is absolutely mindblowing and i say with complete seriousness that this will probably become one of my favorite webtoons on another note i do recommend reading the novel for that extra experience but im really curious to see how this story will turn out as a webtooni cant wait im so glad this got an adaption wwget ready to cry peoplethis gave me solo leveling vibeswaitdid i just see bamthis is such an amazing webtoon the art is gorgeousi was just about to read the novel until this came up and my mind went must read this is so excitingdamn i got goosebumps because the background music was intense 😳 it is a must read ✨just a heads upfor those of you interested in reading the novel please give it a try as well its really good and it was one of the first novels that got me into light novels in the first place the novel was just recently completed too so you can go ahead and binge read it as well there is a lot of world and character building and watching yoo jonghyuks and dokjas relationship development as well as character though id prefer not to spoil it is going to be a nice treat for those of you interested in isekai genres dont mind an op protagonist or prefer a protagonist thats down to earth i highly recommend this trash of the counts family an ongoing fantasy novel with lots of world building and character dynamics and the sclasses i raised which has a similar yet different concept compared to orv with a protagonist thats trying to save his little brother these are the novels i started with and its also what got me into light novels in the first place please have a look at themi literally cried for an hour or so from happiness when i heard there would be a manghwa about omniscient readers viewpoint っ˘̩╭╮˘̩っi highly rate this manhwa i have been a huge fan of the light novel and have read the whole thing and with the solo leveling art it will be amazingwebtoon turn this into an anime you wont regret the decision and hire descent voice actorseditalso webtoon should really add solo leveling to their web series collectioncoolthe artwork is absolutely amazing and this webtoon is my favourite you cant change my mindyyaassfinally it got the recognition it deservedthis webtoon is soo

all but when is solo leveling coming to webtoon 😭😭bon aller jle call ça va être un des meilleurs webtoonthis is so goodcant express how happy i was when i first heard that line webtoon got the localization of omniscient readers viewpoint and not a similar website that have some paywall or some shizz 👀 more ppl get to read orv for free i hope they also license trash of the counts family ughh the thoughts of my two faves getting the recognition feels good 💕better than most trailers 😂👌damnn best trailer ive ever seenabrooo this would be an amazing animei’m feeling a solo leveling vibe from thiswebtoon just hyped this up so fricking muchimagine how meta it would be if this was the webtoon in the webtoonal pareacer soy la única que habla español esta fenomenal el trailer va a pasar años

this would be shitty but i read some of it and it’s pretty decentthis looks so much like solo leveling must read❤cool here comes the normiesokay am gonna read thisi just finished reading the first few episodesive followed the novel this was perhaps one of the greatest novels ive read of course the protagonist is a cheat in his own way but the world still would kick him down any time he pushes past his boundaries there were tons of character developments the worldbuilding was phenomenal theres really nothing much you can ask of it maybe if it had been longer i guess have fun with the webtoon version read it to the end you wont regret iti cant be the only one who thinks this is almost as good as those marvel trailers xdthe problem is this webtoon has translated chapters already but on webtoon it has with fast pass no one would pay for old chapters just release all the available chapters then people would read it on your website or it would be the same as diceomg i still cant

      "Read omniscient reader nowhttpsbitlyjiwgmsemngattt author aku akan selalu mendukung mu  ini seru banget bestie who are youim just a readerme then who am ihan sooyong is the writeri dont really read novel specially korean ones but i must say orv is an amazing wellcreated story from all the mangas or novel i have read never i feel so confused with the plot and stuff yet feeling hungry to know what happens next and keep reading as if its something that must be read the ending was unexpected for me even tho a friend of mine who introduce me to it has giving a few big spoilerswhcih i asked them to since i need spoiler to keep reading i never seen a novelmanga with an ending like that an ending that makes you feel as if you are the of the storyi just finished reading chapter to me it felt like the theatre owner is the author of the novel because he blushed when dokja pierced through his forehead after entering dokjas mind memories where he saw the texts of the novelthis is probably the best official webtoon trailer i see props its intriguing straight to the point intense and sells the story for exactly what it is very nicewill get animation or something a song that really suits this webtoonnovel isrokudenashi one voice good luck to fellow readersthis needs to be an anime so would without a doubt be way better than some of the main stream ones that are popular atm reading the novel then the comic make it even more impactful cant imagine how bad ass the fire dragon scene would be not to mention the other disastersyeah im just a readercoolwow i am reading this manga nowim dying of curiousity what actually is kim dokja what is that one thing even we as readers are still unaware ofthe contellation conie recommends everyone to read this piece of arti read this webtoon months ago and finally decided to read the novel too finished it recently and just woww i dont regret ever reading it even tho its probably the only thing i did this summer lolseries is so goodare we getting an adaptation of this movie or anime i dont mind as long as its good this deserves a great adaptationwhenever i reread the novel i always amaze by how beautiful the author convey the idea and the story tellingthe story that started in a subwayi love orv because of this i got to read the entirety of the novel spoiler alertits an open ending so you get to imagine whatever ending you want  theres also multiple loops and paradoxes in the novel so its one hell of a roller coaster i recommend for ppl to read the novel too if you dont like waiting for new chapters of the manhwa anyways orv ruleslove itmamhwa readers will never know how amazing this series is gonna get here after chap on the novel haha diesits so good to the point i binge watch all chapters in a daydokjaa \\i recently finished this novel and i have never in my life read anything better i stayed awake until am crying over the ending it has left me feeling so many emotions but at the same time so empty this was the greatest read ever i highly highly recommend it to anyone towards the end when everything gets revelaed your mind will truly be blown i will never forget this i miss dokja already so much and the rest toounpopular opinion but omniscient reader solo levellingi love dokja cuz hes so sly and clever plus i cant get enough of the side charactersmc is trash weak compared to the original old mc a weak mc always needs plot armor noobs in the comments saying it has no plot armor forgot that if you wanna save a weak mc you need tons of plot armori hope they will animate orv in the futurefrom i seen this is like that show with time traveling microwave just pure insanity                          i usually dont like reading long i cant believe i wanted more chapters never gonna stop promoting

about storiesorv anime whenmy favorite novel of all timereally hope this series gets animated one daythe best story have the best mc dokja driving me crazyy afbafhsfhsfjtahgcvdvaahfthe novel got me crying thosee you guys inside a subway years laterque delicia de webtoon meus amigoscan u imagine when the webtoon gets to lolbro im bawling my eyes outi hope this comic become animeyoo joonghyuk who are youlee jihye gasps in korean master he is obviously the love of your lifei came expecting copper but holy shit i found a gem mine i literally thought its your typical action comic containing all the tropes youd find in the book and now im reading what couldve be one of the best webnovels to grace this dark planettruly one of the bestwhen we say you guys are not ready trust us for what is about to come your jaws are about to fall and fall hardto the ppl who doesnt ship jungheok x dokja and say dokja x sooyoung or dokja x sangah is better just imagine jungheok was a girl then yall wouldnt have spent a sec to ship themyour double standards are showing homophobic ehi love dokjai have read solo leveling and many adventure webtoon however i must say omniscient reader is my favorite one it gave me great feeling so much emotion happy and sad love and hates rather than just fight and fight i also love the development of support characters and the best part is the chemistry between kim dokja and yoo jong huyk hahai am yoo junghyeokreading omniscient readers viewpoint was the best decision ive ever made i seriously love it so muchwill this getting animatedi never really enjoy reading an action fantasy manhwa but this series got me fixated with my phone for the whole chapters so farfor days straighti never feel so curious about a story because i cant guess what will happen nextkim dokja is unpredictable and i love iti love youi shouldve read this much earlier but i think im not that late too so far so great im currently on chapter on its webtoon and im so excitedoh god i just feel bad for the people who cant see the actual novel i shouldnt compare works but honestly this is the best novel ive read since harry potter it really feels like theres a person named dokja out there how the authorsthe novel writers shing and shong carry out the plot is amazing its not just the plot how they describe the scenes and the raw emotions is beyond art believe me its the best thing ive read so far and the webtoon is good tooim coming back again lmaosince it has a vibe from re zero so i like it even morei read the light novel and all i can say is perfect periodwhat happened to this and the solo levelling anime tuyt vi hi vng ra phimlol their is also novelsheesh is it been already year damnthe moving images made me realize how amazing this would be as an animated series with the samesimilar artstylehonestly its a damn good webtoon like seriously it has such an intricate plot so guys please stop comparing this to manhwas like solo leveling although i dont hate solo leveling it has a simple storyline but the thing is the side characters get overlooked a lot and the existence of gods and monsters and other worlds felt shoehorned and that makes up for an unsatisfying ending while on the other hand omniscient reader has a complex story amazing character development and main character kim dokja doesnt punch his way out of every situation like sun jinwoo no dokja uses his knowledge of this new world he makes use of his party members he always has a plan and thats the thing like about him the most honestly this webtoon deserves more attention now again that said i am not in any way saying that solo leveling is inferior to orv i have read solo leveling believe me it was a very entertaining read but what orv does is it takes some of the elements from sl fills in the stuff that sl was missing and makes it much enjoyable would recommend ohhthis has a trailerto everyone who finished the novel what kind of ending do you wantthis is best novel ive ever read highly recommendonly later does he realize he creates entire universe as a dream and the dream becomes reality while he becomes the godwoahhlistening to mitski while reading novel chapter was the best thingmade me so hypedplease make this into a good extremely well animated anime ufotable or someone else hugehypeewait what he didnt wanted to change the ending he just helping people who didnt survive in the novel when i searched it said that there will be a movie but its impossible to cover that much important things in a movie manwha too seems to be not ending soon enough i hope its anime seriesthe story make my day but the ending ruin my daywow it looks dope as heckfirst ever manhwa that made me read the novel guess what didnt regret anything man u dont have any idea how crazy i am for kdj han sooyoung my wifewhat are the authors official accountsgilyeon is worthydokja world domination cant help but compare how the mc and his coworker lady look similar to the mc and the first healer lady of solo leveling offcourse the plots of both novels are like hell and heaven totally different this felt like it came from an avengers movie trailer oly frick im getting goosegumpswhy is there a manhwa in a webtoon channelorv is absolutely amazing i read the whole novel a few months ago and am uptodate with the webtoon the story plot is very different from the normal mc read the novel and becomes op trope the way the mysteries of the many characters converge into a single twist is absolutely genius definitely an amazing readlove this one give it a try you wont regretreading this webtoon and the novel is probably the greatest thing ive done in my entire lifeand then he realizes that he is the oldest dreammost ancient dream d e p r e s s i o n  as a comic huehhh sayangkudokja bau mayadthis novel takung reader and bromance and tsundere to the whole new level        o friday when is it going to come down say quickly pleasei had read the manhwa first before finishing the novel and goddamn orv manhwa now feels way different after all those chapters of the novel my perception of the manhwa as i was reading it for the first time was how refreshing it was and plot is packed af now ive finished the novel manhwas atmosphere became heavy its not like the manhwa failed to capture the angst of the novel it was my expectations who failed me for not noticing the angst beforehand lolif i continue to regress will i ever get to meet you againi know im late about it but its actually so funny when he says im just a reader hes also saying his own name xdi like the novel especially the dokja character    god i watched this trailer in an ad a year ago and i was like wow this looks like generic garbage one year later im chapters in when i realized this trailer was for the webtoon adaptation of orvthis is one of the best web toons i have read in the past year tog got too complicated and muggy whereas this is fun to the point and surprisingim % sure that no one can hurt me anymore thx orvpainful screachjust a random comment damn hope they make this master piece into an anime just like solo levelingthe best fiction novel everokay but it is hard for me not to be scared that this is a other way the story will spread and then the hell will start i wonder if it is just in korea or in all the worldi almost done the novel i only have two things to say one im depressed and two this is a masterpiece     es tan hermoso que voy a llorari finally reread it and i have realized a lot something that i never realize when i first read itthis story is for just that one readerwebtoon you need to drop a physical version of the manwha because it is % true to the novels content istg the novel is amazing it never fails to make me cry and laugh and the art is amazing just take my money masterpiece thats what orv is honestly one of my favorite webtoons bc the story is so interestingspoiler tagdokja is a great role model for gilyoungbest ln i have seen hands downreading the novels ending while listening to cold plays everglow made me cry like a riveri love dokja sm i cry everytime i remember the noveli have lovehate relationship to masterpieces like this  ive just know about the epilogue of this webtoon in its webnovel and its just wholesome and sad at the same time for me the type of story that you know that its super amazing but wholesomely broke your heart at the same time i love how the true substance of this story isnt something like wish fulfillment op mc with corny romance and power fantasy hype despite being under the systemapocalypse themethe story is incredible albeit painfully slow burn and theres no telling what happensthe charm doesnt only stick and revolve around the mc and the side characters dont feel onedimensional and actually progresses on and off screen theres no pandering or delay in each chapter and story progression is real here every mystery is unfolded throughout the story and plot holes are properly concluded i truly appreciate plotcentric stories like this literal goldfor whoever still doubt whether to read this webtoon or no you must read it it is so greatt you wont regret it i already read the webtoon version ongoing & novel finished english translatedits really the best thing ive ever readim just a reader soo badass one of the best webnovel ive read so faarrr im in love with all of the characters hereee i still cant believe at the ending mind blowing god ive only seen that many episodes on web novel both the mc and the author are dedicatedi love this story too muchthisss is reallyy good i remember i stayed up late night to finish my planned chaptershiii i have a question is it advisable to read the novel first before the manhwa or i could read the manhwa first are there a lot of revised details in the manhwa adaptation or is it just the samehoithe hyypei love this novel more than my entire lifeif dokja is a reader of the novel wouldnt that make him living in his own fanfici got goosebumps is there something like revolution gonna happen herek who dislike will be either cut off from sponsorship or wiped out by the demon judge of firepleas add arabic language to webtoon appif you havent started the web novel yet dont do it unless you want to be addicted and lose many hours of sleepmam i am towards the ending of the light novel and i also read the webtoon too and have only one thing to say and that is this thing is dopein both ln and webtoon the plot is indescribably great sigh but the novel already gave me depression imagine the reading it again in picturesif youre reading this story it means youre going to a therapistim cryingfeels like solo levelingwhats the soundtrack titlelindonangisin dokjaone of the holy trinity webnovels of south korea for a reasonno way i cant wait to watch it aaahhthis is such a well written story the mc is smart and charismatic and the side characters too are also very well written its one of the webtoons i enjoyed

tbh i like both series equally since they are totally different the only similarity i can see is the art style both are slow burn in term of progress from the beginning but become stronger after point and pretty consistent to the end sl plot is mediocre thus easy to understand whereas orv plot is complex sl has straightforward attack description of action that led immediate impact whereas orv has multiple attack engagements with world historyrelated that may require a bit of thinking before the impact of any action sl gaming system is only applicable to mc that powers by an entity whereas orv apply streaming system to all characters powers by fablestory sl reaches international popularity due to webtoon hype whereas orv has gained international high recognition with webnovel however i find myself able to engage more with orv due to the characters and worldbuilding especially towards kim dokja i resent and support him happy and cry for him empathize and sympathize with him altogether at the same time is that girl in white with short hair han sooyoungthe demon king of salvation is silently watchingi highly recommend reading the novel worth it  just finished the novel and i feel so damn sadbest webtoonjonna saranghemassive spoileri think that han sooyung and kim dokja is the canon ship here theres this underlying meaning on how sooyung would write a novel only for one person to read and that is kim dokja and dokja even accepted han sooyungs proposal of reading her novel dokja even suggested for its genre to be romance romance with kim dokja even warning her that if he read her novel he might complain that hes picky that he would always bug her with comments and that it is possible that he would bug her for more chapters to which han sooyung is really glad since thats what han sooyung has been searching for han sooyung was jealous of tls wont spoil who that is but those who read until final will know because tls got kim dokja who would always comment on every single chapter and she really wanted someone like kim dokja too if this story can really save you then ill keep writing the epilogue for you until the end of time for eternity this basically shows that she is willing to give her entirety to him for all eternity for the last chapters all she has been doing is writing all day and all night in hopes of saving kim dokja shes willing to give her time for all eternity to kim dokja and she was the one who basically saved him han sooyung literally saved him in more ways than one with even saving kim dokja before the start of everything there is a paradox within this context readers will know is it not obvious just how much han sooyung means to kim dokja and how much kim dokja means to han sooyung they are literally made for each other the beginning and the end from before everything started how everything started from the start every moment and until the conclusion han sooyung saved kim dokja and kim dokja saved han sooyung kim dokja agreeing to be her reader means he would dedicate everything of him to her for all eternity as kim dokja said he is just a reader and this really shows everything about himhe is a reader by becoming han sooyungs reader hes basically dedicating his entirety to her and theyre both constellations they can literally be with each other forever han sooyung would write for kim dokja for all of eternity and kim dokja would dedicate all of himself as a reader for han sooyung for all of eternity honestly theyre absolutely perfect together absolutely in the last chapters even it was all because of han sooyungs longing for kim dokja that they were able to save kim dokja which was supposed to be impossible she dedicated dedicated her humanity to kim dokja her everything to him and kim dokja also lived and was saved because of her dedicating his all being han sooyungs reader for all of eternity just for her this is absolutely love it may even be the truest love ive ever seen they dedicate everything of themselves to each other for all of their  eternityhey webtoon readers if u didnt know this is a novel adaptation so yeeeah read that tooi dont know if anyone commented on this yet but im liking the bits of animation in this trailershould i read the webnovel i already read the raws and im so hypedd and does anyone know where to read the webnovel for freecant wait to see yoo sangah in black chinese dress if this was an anime it would get anime of the yearvba anyone plz tell me who is thr guy shown in in this trailer i really wanna knowthis story is a rollercoaster of emotionsorv is one of the best ln i ever read so im sure its going to be be a amazing ride oh i hope they dont make dokja gay in thisyeah the story better than solo lvelingdokja is my favorite characteri just started reading this at the very beginning of this month may and its become one of my ultimate favorites already its so mwahwhyd it keep saying hes the only reader he never thought that hes just the only one to finish reading itim up to volume in the novel and i have to say this is one of the best stories i have read in a long time you seriously wouldnt regret reading it the way dokja uses his knowledge of the story and adjusts to scenes he never expected are so impressiveguys do you know that dokja means reader in korean so the title of this novel is omniscient reader view point   will there be an animedamn this trailer is some another level shiti am just waiting for biyuujust finished reading the webnovel and i must say orv was the best novel ive ever read in my whole life i felt so empty alr and i dont usually reread a story but now id like to read it again orv made me appreciate reading a story to know diff povs of the characters i cant wait to read the upcoming chapters in webtoon too i recommend this so badly its so good read it i beg you you wont regret itits a mix of fantasy action and comedy i thought webtoon doesnt allow blood scenes     there are three ways to survive the apocalypse but that doesnt mean that only three people can survivei hope webtoon version give this series a happy family side story our lovely squid dokja constellations deserve ittt my dokjaa oh my god yeess this series got me hooked ay the first episode it is amazing and how he usus his knowdlege                okay but was this inspired from the japanese drama alice in borderlandi have read the webtoon but the plot is same for both survival games its just aib is more gore amd horror and this is scifiokay soo i calculated for how many years it will take for the manhwa to finishthere are a total of chapters in the novel week chapter month chapters year chaptersso chapters chapters a year years years x days total days to finishand i didnt include other variables that may affect the number of chapters made eg months of hiatus and that theyll shortencut some scenes from the novel so that they can catch up and wont take too long to be completedso maybe the estimated years to finish will be about years at least because the artist needs to take hiatus to prepare for the next season and also if theres any accidents or health issuesdamn thats long but ill wait because im so excited to see it drawnthis novel is completely different from the rest it is truly a whole new level of novel in the novel is full of elements and believe me you wont be able to guess what will happen next and have you ever tried to imagine yourself in a series where you are not the main character and this series of novels will satisfy you it is very worth to read ita few chapters in and im already going crazy this is so damn good good doesnt even begin to explain how good it isprepare your tissues in advancethus the ugliest king was bornim a new reader of the webtoon but i am curious as to why huiwon isnt famous among the characters i mean i really love her character and i actually ship her with dokjaam i the only onebtw should i wait for the manhwa or should i read the novellike very much this serie when you like this so much it feels like you were became a certain constellation hungry for the story for this shit offif this doesnt get animated in the next years or something i swear im ready to fightmerinding gila ngeliat trailernya this story has a lot of  our protagonist would get  and be  there are many fun characyers like yjh the  who is also  and an annoying character named h who will be the protagonists paradox among paradox imoive been reading the noveland it legitimately makes you cry at timesits so goodits been a few months since ive read the novel and im still getting chillsi fking love this bookimagine if this gets an anime adaptation would probably take the world by storm who are youim just a reader and im the only one who knows the end of this worldi really hope this gets an anime or dramaguys how do you make such good content what the fuckk im so excitedits been so long since ive finished the novel and ngl im still feeling empty whenever im missing dokja every now and then lmao imagine being so attached to a man who doesnt exist in your world line oh es sorprende el nmero de visitas del vdeo ya entiendo porque es tan famoso en inglsthe dislikes are from sl simps vdokja im just a readerme that is what im going to say if every comic from webtoon or manga become real why the heck she smiling at himrelationship alertthe light novel reader will be like kim dokja while talking to manhwa readers lololwhats the name of the song used in the trailerahhh goosebumps  esse manhwa  perfeitoaahhh kim dokja uwaahhthis is way better than solo leveling the only thing why solo leveling is so popular right now is because the artthe more i read this the more it feels like one of those soulless cultivation manhuas where the mc gets more and more op and crushes his opposition easily with little effort when i first started reading this i thought there would be some depth to the story given how the confrontation with the statues played out but right now its not anything like that there doesnt seem to be any struggle or deep thoughts or philosophy in the story just constant power ups except for the mc all the other characters are very forgettable due to how one dimensional they are and it seems the mc is rapidly turning one dimensional and forgettable as well its almost impossible to be emotionally invested in this story unlike in a good shounen like naruto or one piece solo leveling didnt even get popular until the mahwa come out and become a huge hit while orv is already popular before the mahwa come out thats the differenti love the webtoon hopefully the anime is gonna be goodive just been simping on kim dokja and jung heewon all the timefinallyoh kim dokja fans of the webtoon and webnovel theres an omniscient reader community on amino httpaminoappscomcomniscient_reader_amino one fact wrong mc is not the only reader but he is the only reader that finished reading itdokja is lowkey sung jin wooprobably the best book ive readthe animation so good the animation is way better than the othersthe webtoon is rlly gudits my second fav  i hope will be different the ending in this manhwa theres

tense because we dont know what happened if the book protagonist died so mc has to think of a way to save his and someone elses ass also book protagonist have a depressionive been watching this countless times cant wait for the anime to existif it were an anime then it would probably be a global hit it shouldve in anime not comics maybe after the comics there will be anime bcoz most of the

teleported into the world of the series which is my favorite genre isekai is the name of the genre so going to read thiswhat is with the dislikesyou guys cannot tell me that the mc from omniscent reader doesnt look like the young distant cousin of the mc from solo levelling nobody can change my mindthis is the type of comic that keeps u on ur toes and makes u fall flat on ur face for the mc i dont regret itthis deserves a full fledged anime edition i cannot get enough my mind has been blown and the art is strikingly gorgeous tt cannot wait for more updates constellation lazy webers smilesmans hacking irlthis is better than solo leveling it hits in korea so hard always # this aint a adult manhwano gonna lie i got some chill when he said he can change the ending ouf this manhwa is crazyone of the best thing about this novel is that it indicates this story being passed to sing n song the real author of this webtoon by the op of this story which actually leaves you in the edge with this strong feeling of the apocalypse being real that this whole webtoon is a real happening and one of us could be mcs reincarnation fuckin yeahabout time it seems the best novel in history came with a webnovel hell yeaheu decido ver do que  o manhwa a vejo issoit looks like a real anime intro hahahahahahahahahhaa love your comradeship coins has been sponsoredcant wait for king of a kingless world arc and every arc after that lmaoalso sooyoung dokja     giving me the sweet home vibesnoat first i thought it was good but i was wrong it is the beststill cant believe kaidou gave into the dark reunioni hope crunchyroll will make this an animeanyone please tell me kim dokja is a gay or noti hope no but only one thing is certain thati will survivei love this webtoon so muchim think that this incredible webtoon should have an animeabii nerden izlerim bunu yardm edin mangasn okuyorum u anthe best part about this webtoon is that everyone thinks dokja is gaylove this webtoonaha the most ancient dreamthe webnovel of this is one of the best things ive ever read it was simply amazing for me  this webtoon is the perfect example of reasons why this is a mustread webtoonthe entire freaking plot is so badass that you wont be able to handle it mc dokja is the most savage protagonist you ever gonna meet tons of other reasons are there too but my hands ache from typing but i promise you you wont ever regret clicking fight like a reader~dokjaomnisient reader is very different from some other manhwas or novels like every boys admire mc and every girls fall in love to mc every side characters have their own story and own development their are many genres in this story fantasy apocalypes comedy survival tragedy action and even little bromance just for humor omnisient readers mc is not overpowered character his only adventage is that he knows all the original story so he has to solve the difficult situation just with his knowledge however he tries to change the story since the original story is full of tragedy and failness and this makes really interesting story i highly recommand to read this both the webtoon and the novel its plot is awesome and all characters are great the novels english translation is quite awful but its okay to read iti read this on another site and i honestly just cant wait for morebe aware of the king of ugly he will speed run this apocalypse with a simple novelwhen mc isnt the mc what the hellbruhh i already read this but this is my first time watching this so its giving me a goosebumpshahhahahahhaso when are you gonna do a trailer for eleceedi just hope there will be no romance in thisour kim dokja is so handsome~spoilerthis trailer the last panel is that the th scenario the arkittive been thinking abt this for some time now to novel readersarent we all the most ancient dream rather than a constelation since hsy basically wrote orv and the ending of the epilouge was left to be ambigious leaving us to use our own imagination on what we think the ending is basically dreaming about itwell turns out he isnt the only reader lol peak homoerotic tensionnow this is a webtoon worth reading who knows one out millions of novels mangas etc can most likely become reality especially the apocalypselove this story hope this series is a long one reading is powerful and knowledgeable sunfishman this trailer really makes

masterpieceimagine this webtoon specifically coming to life the first time you take the subwaycan somebody please tell me the name of the software used to create this intro pleasecan i just say i love the main character in this story he literally could of saved everyone in the cabin but instead he killed all the eggs on his own so he could kill one guy he didnt likethis is not a yaoi rightare they planning on putting episodes in to this because ive read the the first few and i need this in my life i havent read the novel but i really hope this web tune will end up being super longlets make this highest liked webtoon video in webtoon channelim reading this and the last episode we have to wait for days what the fujsiskxkslakz im just kidding but it does take days in order to read the last episode because it takes long to make a webtoon so i understandi already finished reading the whole webnovel chapters what a ridethere were some points where i thought this is getting repetitive that its cliche cheesy cringe and i considered to drop it several timesbut i continue reading just like how kim dokja faithfully reads ways of survival and i gradually fell in love with it the unique plot the characters i love how well written they arealso the ending really got my heart a very proper one imodefinitely recommend it to anyone who read this commentyes to you the reader just as i am a reader toofor reference it is said that this webtoon is preparing to produce about hundreds of animations scheduled to be produced in movies and drama seasonscommon guys u got goosebumps while watching this didnt u~~well atleast i didi have been reading the novel for days straight and its damn good currently on chapter omniscient readers viewpointomniscient readers viewpoint if his dad wasnt abusive aa i cant wait to see how the future events in the novel will actually lookthis needs to be animelooks solid af i will give it a chanceconstellation the watcher of light and darkness is smiling at youomg all of the main characters are in this scene omg dude i was here when the trailer was just out and it already has million viewers less than a month thats awesome this webtoon is literally something its truly deserves it when is the anime version coming outi would love to see this as a animei underestimated the power of this webtoon now i am hooked to ithm~ another one was added to the list now ill just wait for a reincarnator adaptation sobsgood storyand i was quietly staring at that scenehappy million views i am already reading this webtoon and i hadnt seen its trailer yetthe trailer is even more freaking awesome than the webtoonthis is gonna be the next solo leveling and when it does im gonna be the one of the few people to say that i was part of the og fam note part of the og manhwa fan btw i havent read the novel since im a kid so i cant pay for the chapters that trailer give me goosebumpsand this kids is why you should read booksso they finally made it into webtoonthis is gayone of the best things is that the mc wont be in a romantic relationship so the shippers can go crazy but not having romance also is one of the best thing about itthe novel is a masterpiece webtoon had just came out a month or so ago and im here anticipating for an anime to be made i very much expected there to be one after the webtoon but i know making webtoon and animes are hard work so i will wait patientlyeditactually now that they had decided to have omniscient reader will they also translate the manhuawebtoon for the trash of the counts family i really hope they do i know that theres a korean manhuawebtoon but i dont know koreani hope they will have it on webtoon but then the novel is incomplete right now and i think webtoon only picks up completed novels okay im just going to wait and hopewhere can i read this besides webtoonauthornim so how many times are you going to diekim dokja yesas a reader of the light novel i will only say one thingthe story of omniscient reader viewpoint is a paradox at some point i was asking a question similar to is the egg born before the chicken or is the chicken born before the eggits heree finally cant wait until the comics go with chaps itd be epicwould you like to use the stigma the absolute majority of constellations in the channel are feeling immense joythe constellation prisoner of the golden headband is pulling out his hair in excitementthat dude needs to get a hair cut smhspoilerssun wukong too opjokes aside the art seems goodso the anime adaptation comes out whenthis man looks a lot like jin woo and his scenario is also very similar highly recommend you read the light novel that the webtoon is based on im pretty sure its completed too endgame and infinity war are tremblingkim dokja you fucking bastard  literally this is the best novel ive ever read i was overwhelmed for weeks when i finished you cant predict anything the characters developement everything is insane this is exactly what i wished whenever i finished reading a novel i wanted to enter the world of a story for example i imagined myself as a wizard in the wizarding world of harry potter hahahathis trailer is in my opinion not good no i dont wish to back that up with observations or facts i simply had a negative reaction to it and it made me want to pass on what could easily be a good piece of mediathe trailer is epic its like an animation movie it says from the studio that brought you solo leveling but webtoon doesnt have solo leveling i put my high hope that in the coming future this will become a series episodes i would definitely watch it no matter what the animation were so amazing when i red the first chapter ive never been such so automatically amazed by it because i can usually sense that this is a spectacular storyline unlike any other comics that takes few chapter that pirques my interest this comic is on another level must recommend for anyone out there who havent read this yet a huge regards to the authorugh as a reader of the novel im speachless dont let me down pleasei found out about the novel because of the webtoon i thought it was gonna be just another no brainer read to pass boredom and i couldnt fathom why chapters long chapters in and i was still invested chapters in and i was crying chapters in and im freaking wailinga must read with a steady plot great plot twists and very loveable and round characters im so excited for the webtoony u r i s or b l s pleaseimagine if they made this into an animeim reading this at nightcan anyone explain to me how this has so many dislikes any drama going on or is pretty much one of the best novels and webtoons of this type with decent amount of chapters right now so whyi wont be suprised if crunchyroll turns this into an anime too once it gets enough episodesi mean this trailer had really good quality and animationbut for now lets focus on the comic and novel shall weew weeb stuffi downloaded webtoon for thisthis should be an animei hope this is how they animate the whole series of they make a animated versionits actually really good i invested into reading this all night lits getting so much views im

in addition literature that precedes reality is nothing new if you will revolutions can begin in underground settings with secret meetings and literature dissemination lots of it revolutions then

scenekimi wa dare ore wa reader datoo bad the manhwa was still at chapter the mc looks a lot like sung jin woo from solo levelingi havent read the comic but the novel truly is goodthe protagonist is aware that his the protagonisti have the novel in my library for awhile now but i havent started reading it yet guess this is a sign alreadyit would be pretty epic if this gets adapted into an animeafter reading the th chap from manwha i couldnt contain myself so i for the first time in my life started reading novel and guess what id never this decision of minethis webtoon is seriously good but horribly short i used to follow it before it got on webtoon and on webtoon it is a couple chapters behindthis is so good on godthe artwork char looks rly similar to solo leveling at first is it gay tho this should become an anime if tower of god bacame one why not this anime and manga is getting destroyed by manhwa and i love it because im an manga reader i only watch few anime arise manhwabrought a whole new level to the world of sioc huhyuss im screaming hope it gets adapted into an anime and good animationthe character looks like the one at the solo levellingim not really a fan of novel but im so curious whats the next chapter was so i read the novel and i cant stop reading it i started last day and im on chap now you should read this webtoonnovelhighly recommendedwhen is it being released as an animei have never been hyped to a trailer this is a must readseriously this manhwa not best because the plot is so stupid even cannot fight a story of solo leveling

meet your matchif you watch agents of shield you understand what i mean didnt look into this for a while bc i usually hate isekai stuff but after starting the webtoon i was hooked ended up reading the webnovel too now im already chapters in and its only been three days its really well written and nearly every character gets their own development the worldbuilding is amazing and the story development is well paced and interesting the relationships between the characters feel very genuine and well built it doesnt feel cheap at all the story itself feels so immersive its genuinely one of the easiest thing to get into for me its been a while since ive been this hooked by a storyyall the novel constantly established how kdj was considered ugly by everyone but if i hear one comment about it in the webtoon im gonna be sitting there like bitch is you blind#noonelovesyouno se ustedes pero quiero que ya salga en espaol im gonna read this because i want to find out if there is an author to this novel i wonder if the reader will come face to face with the authorguys guys if youre a webtoonmanhwa reader i really recommend reading this i finished reading the novel of this yes its completed a few weeks ago and its so good i still cant stop thinking about aa there is so much character development and plot is just chefs kiss mindblowingtheres a reason why omv is one of the most if not the most popular webtoon in south korea rn god i just love it so muchthis is actually goodthe art reminds me of tower of god season any song recommendations you all listened to while reading the webtoon and novelwhen the webtoon and novel hit you that hard is this anime omg plus chapters online dont buy itim korean flatform reader and i am sure that you must read this this is hundred million down loaded in korea the legend of internet nobelhow did the webtoon grow up this fast did the author self promoted himself or just it got popular on its own solo leveling creator anyway its awsomesince it has chapters and im assuming that one episode of webtoon is one chapterone chapter a week would take ten years to finish right ksajdhksjahh ya quiero que aparezca uriel mi bebesitaaomg is this a movie teaserhey web toon i request to make the mercules seris lady bug and cat noir pleas made romantic sireasthat line im just a reader made me want to read it is this worth reading just askingthis webtoon

ginihope this get animated some daythis isnt going to be a power fantasy manhwa its so good at how incredibly balanced everything is there are going to be feels part in this but goddamn mann itss so fucking good this manhwa is going to make subarus suffering looks like a fucking jokehow about solo leveling it was what all mangamanhwamanhua readers waiting for come on guysthis thing is worth readingliterally better than what i expected i highly recommend reading omniscient readerlove this webtoon im obsessed with this webtoon but im too broke to buy fast pass ttx who are youme im just a readeri am really liking this webtoon not gonna liebtw yall there are chapters on mangakakalot lolmy baby has an adaptationnn congratulations   omg i love this novelno puedo creer que la vea ahora como webtoon no entendere nada pero ya se la historia as que ya sabre que pasa if this becomes an anime i will donate so muchbackground songthis webtoon is like exactly what ive been waiting for game like level op mc apocalypse streaming wtf its so perfect god damni am just a reader woof that hit hard crunchyroll better make an anime about omniscient reader or im gonna riot man it would be dope if they make an anime about this i would love it dokja really out here speedrunning the apocalypseat you can see that that a is shining in the bottomi wonder what that means add back solo levelingwhat about buying the rights to solo leveling with the crunchy boys and make an adaptation insteadohhh no wonder the art style was so similardokjaagghh i love my boiiidamn straight omg the trailer looks so good ive read up to chapter ish on the novelsoo when solo leveling on webtooni just wanted to escape from realityyeah me tooi wanted to make my manga as webtoon which i wanted to start but i dont know how to become featured artistlol you guys are slow the english scans is already out to chapter episodes gotta find that webtooni have read the ln a while ago and its a good fricken read would recommend middle gets a little slow but its still a great readi cant wait for yjh to show upsounds really stupid not gonna lie imma go read itlook id be more willing to read it with out the trailer if you just kept patt that same people who made solo made this i would of read it % from the studio that brought you solo levelingsay no more im hookedyurrsolo leveling must be next anime adaptationnot trying to spoil anything for anyone but lee gilyoung the smol child looks more scary than what i expectedlegit gave me chillsaccept jesus as the son of god according to the bible all christians who recognize jesus as the son of god are able to be savedread about jesus death on the cross to understand salvation in the bible god sends jesus to earth so that he can die and absolve humanity of original sindevote yourself fully to god in everything you do if your confuse just do this if you want to be saved do this repent know that you are a sinner believe that christ died for you for your sins and that god raised him from the dead on the third day if you believe it with all your heart all your soul and all your mind you will be saved by the holys of holys amen theres a reason why this is the most popular webnovel in south korea the mc is not an op character but hes clever and way more charismatic hes also a strategist using the knowledge he knows in the novel hes not an emotionless robot or a killing machine side characters are not just there to be amazed by the mc theyre actually strong too on their own they are lovable there is no plot armor you know what that meanscharacter deaths the plot might be about survival and you think its the same for many others no its not you would be surprised so stop comparing this to a power fantasy like solo levelling as much as i love that manga because who hates an op mc honestly this far surpasses solo levelling because everyone has a mysterydislikeepicim am so confused with this can someone explainthis comic is amaizngtheres a lot more chapters on manga readersolo leveling got the webtoon game on smashtrust me this is really goodthis looks absolutely amazing even better than some anime trailersthis has a webtoon im

webtoongif hype gonna be strongyesss the webtoon is here im getting hyped kyyaaawhy is there only chapters when theres actually or morei hope the mc doesnt get powers like his only ability is that he knows whats going to happen or maybe he also has some other power but it doesnt boost any of his base attributes or stats if youre a gamerreading a book mustve never felt so exciting huhi dont dont know how they do it but the promotional video always makes the webtoon seem worse then it isi was actually avoiding this webcom but nowthink ima check it ouutthis new premise has become a rising gem it reminds me of my new life as a villainess and scumvillains selfsaving system in the awareness of our main character but it presents this main character as starting as a reader and taking up the

beautiful aahhafter reading orv in webnovel and webtoon medium _now i want to watch this as a high quality anime_ sobs dokja this was actually a manhwa before it was even on webtoon you can read it on a website called webtoonxyzalso it is up to like chapter this is gonna be a great webtoon the light novel is a masterpiece in my opinion cant wait to see it webtoonizedthe manga not being finished made me read the novel but now i dont know who is who when someone is talking and i get confused~this is why im better off with reading the manga but its not finished ~~it is quite gooddamn i just noticed if this was animated it would look so goodthis is a great read i do recommend you read it if you haventcamecan out during sunmmerim still on webtoon because of inordinary remember when it first came out so long agoi would go against reading it to anyone its confusing if you dont know korean history and the ending is very disappointingseems interesting i might look into itliterally read this days agothis is no longer animated images by god this is an anime trailer yo when are we gonna get everyone else is a returneei read some of the episodes already and theyre amazingi bet he wrote it for himself from the futurei wish animes existence was just fictionwhy did i get logged out my account the novel is really good toodad reading is powerme so you read it toguys its not a webtoon original comic thats why its actually goodyall remember when this was on reaperscans lol cant wait to readwhen you already read the novel and your exited for the web toon alright give me all the spoilers nowwords cannot explain my excitement for this right nowwith webtoon getting animes this will be a great one for sure im already hookedit was an interesting novel i didnt like it but you mightbetttman i read the novel a way back since it came out and i was mind blown by how good it was now we get the comic version the comic does justice to the novel although some parts are missing because the novel itself has a lot of exposition but they make it up with the art like the background is really important like the background of the art comes back as really important stuff definitely a new experience just like it was meant to be i am happy for the comic versionthis looks pretty coolyeet ive been injecting this straight into my veins for the past month and a halfomg is anyone else excited to ship dokja and jonghyuk their relationship is probably the most developed out of all of them in the novel and its so cutealso pls dont hate on this commentthis is a very promising webtoonyo the animation is opi just noticed the mc looks like jin woo from solo levelingso why is solo leveling not on webtoondefinitely recommendehhh this is a webtoon i read it at zeroscans better check it out on the webtoon app might have more chapts nvm its at chapter zeroscans is at like they havent uploaded any new chapters so maybe webtoon bought the series from themi thought this was from the solo leveling people it had that art style so far its pretty goodwebtoon really is trying to push the ysa fl agenda lol but ljh looks so cool in that classroom shotoh man its officially out anyways so everyone join the omniscient reader english fandom discord because the webnovel was great and the webtoon looks just as great so far and theyve opened up a discussion area for webtoon only readers so you can talk about what happens as the chapters get releasedrip reaperscans they have my respect and i hope webtoon doesnt make the redraws shit pls dont do this to us againi thought the thumbnail was deku and iida from mha but holy damn this looks sicktime to see the greatest bromance in history in art formhype hype hype i just picked up the novel and mwah the flavori already started this on a different site but what the hell are those last chapter never seen that beforei started reading this comic because of the free coin event and i swear am not regretting this webtoon is  beautiful solo leveling is such a good webtoon so this should be great as wellanyone not gonna mention that same artist also drew solo leveling its very obvious thoughtthis is actually a pretty well written story so far you cant really predict what is going to happen next the mc is not exactly the mc of this story which will make you think what the hell is going on here and trust me when i say this they actually make this dynamic work excited to see how this story goeswhen i saw solo leveling i screamed and now it is my duty to read this before i diedi never thought id see the day webtoon puts a systemesque manhwa on its platform i assumed itd never happen but then again with solo levelling theyd probably want to get in on it hopefully theyll put more web novel adapted manhwas on their platform itd be nice if they were a bit more mainstreamlove the art style since its from the same studio that made solo levelingyall this is the best fucking novel i ever read please give it a read before checking out the web toon its on webnovelwhy im crying watching this yazz finallyconstellation demon king of salvation is smiling from abovegood shit read the novel toowhat in the name of off brand sung jin woo is thiswhere are the animatorsif you havent read this yet i recommend it % the story is absolutely mindblowing and i say with complete seriousness that this will probably become one of my favorite webtoons on another note i do recommend reading the novel for that extra experience but im really curious to see how this story will turn out as a webtooni cant wait im so glad this got an adaption wwget ready to cry peoplethis gave me solo leveling vibeswaitdid i just see bamthis is such an amazing webtoon the art is gorgeousi was just about to read the novel until this came up and my mind went must read this is so excitingdamn i got goosebumps because the background music was intense  it is a must read just a heads upfor those of you interested in reading the novel please give it a try as well its really good and it was one of the first novels that got me into light novels in the first place the novel was just recently completed too so you can go ahead and binge read it as well there is a lot of world and character building and watching yoo jonghyuks and dokjas relationship development as well as character though id prefer not to spoil it is going to be a nice treat for those of you interested in isekai genres dont mind an op protagonist or prefer a protagonist thats down to earth i highly recommend this trash of the counts family an ongoing fantasy novel with lots of world building and character dynamics and the sclasses i raised which has a similar yet different concept compared to orv with a protagonist thats trying to save his little brother these are the novels i started with and its also what got me into light novels in the first place please have a look at themi literally cried for an hour or so from happiness when i heard there would be a manghwa about omniscient readers viewpoint i highly rate this manhwa i have been a huge fan of the light novel and have read the whole thing and with the solo leveling art it will be amazingwebtoon turn this into an anime you wont regret the decision and hire descent voice actorseditalso webtoon should really add solo leveling to their web series collectioncoolthe artwork is absolutely amazing and this webtoon

far legitso far the best webtoon trailer ive seeni was waiting for this trailer since i started itfact the same who drew solo leveling is now drawing this webtooni love it i just came back from reading solo leveling and saw this as a recommendationthis is good and all but when is solo leveling coming to webtoon bon aller jle call a va tre un des meilleurs webtoonthis is so goodcant express how happy i was when i first heard that line webtoon got the localization of omniscient readers viewpoint and not a similar website that have some paywall or some shizz  more ppl get to read orv for free i hope they also license trash of the counts family ughh the thoughts of my two faves getting the recognition feels good better than most trailers damnn best trailer ive ever seenabrooo this

gonna read thisi just finished reading the first few episodesive followed the novel this was perhaps one of the greatest novels ive read of course the protagonist is a cheat in his own way but the

it had been longer i guess have fun with the webtoon version read it to the end you wont regret iti cant be the only one who thinks this is almost as good as those marvel trailers xdthe problem is this webtoon has translated chapters already but on webtoon it has with fast pass no one would pay for old chapters just release all the available chapters then people would read it on your website or

      "Im happy with this twist im sick of characters who try so hard to stick to the moral high ground i’m really interested to see dokja’s developement at this point since he’s clearly not going to be a ‘good’ character i don’t think he’ll be straight up evil but i’m excited to see the extent of his neutrality at the very least the people “sharing is caring” dokja i don’t care person_shrugging‍male_sign️ edit just to clarify i don’t disagree with dokja’s decision i just thought it was funny how people were trying to get him to maintain a high “moral ground” but he was just like nah this an apocalypse my dudesfinally a mc that makes the most optimal choice ive been getting bored of mcs always trying to be the herofor real though aside from the people dokja originally saved with the bugs everyone is a murderer they have a lot of audacity to be begging for their lives i’m down with dokja’s pragmatismwait i just noticed look at the panel when dokja cuts the guys arms you see that he is facing away from his group then look at the last panel you can see that he has his back now turned to the guy whose arms he cut off and his body is facing towards his group so that means that this man just cut the guys arms off turned around and then look over his shoulder to flex on all these people xdthis really is gonna be the best webtoon on the app and if they end up making an anime adaption you know it’ll go crazyi really like the approach to an antihero type of character it’s nice to see someone who is intelligent but doesn’t magically make all the right decisions it makes him seem really human mostly fending for himself great work author please keep it up them gimme coinsdokja whythem ugh let’s just kill him and take the coinsdokja mistake slashthem pikachu surprised facei guess the guy at the end there was “disarmed” eh ehhlol why didnt he just let everybody know about the k coins the cursed guy with the suit hascrowd give me a refund dokja sorry there is a no refund policy give us coins dokja i missed the part where thats my problem this webtoon along with solo leveling is all i am looking forward to every weekcrowd let me get thatdokja its gone cost you an arm and legthey had time to complete the quest but they where sitting there all that time just crying about it and now its his fault pathetic pretty sure sangah has ariadne as her constellation ariadne is sometimes seen as the goddess of mazes and is credited with giving theseus a ball of string to find his way out of the minotaurs labyrinth i mean that was so iconic from that story it just seems too coincidental i dont know if a japanesekoreanchinese myth involving string exists to provide an alternative i honestly think that his decision is the goodone he needs verification that anyone he gives coins to will at least be able to offer something to him in exchange if they dont then they wouldnt be surviving very long anyways if he helped them it would probably just make them suffer longer with no hope of actually surviving and acclimating to the new world order i mean they couldnt muster coins dokja gets that much as a gift from the constellations all the timethe first theme being original sin would that mean the second theme is survival of the fittest he wouldnt be doing any of them a favor by handing out coins for free as they would be bound to the other guy they would rather take the easy path and just kill him when all they really need to do is offer either an item of their own or their services in future runs its how society is supposed to work in the grand scheme of things where all parties work at their own pace to contribute manager dude got k coins last chapter let him save the peoplem i think my favorite constellation is the secret plotterhes right he worked for his coins even with his knowledge he still had to accomplish those things to get an award this webtoon touches a lot of areas in society and its great thank you author for amazing comic i think the facts come down too no one has a moral high ground here like he said original sin they all murdered someone to be alive right now so the fact they expect some one to save them after that is ludicrous no one is good or evil here it’s just survival for survivals sakedokja is also not dokja i believe he is the omniscient reader otherwise he would cling to humanity and sins for example he would had tried to save as many people as possible but instead decided to let them choose their fates he knows what to do and how to do it instead of morals he thinks with the most logic very interesting and also very hard to stay on that path having the ability of the fourth wall also helped in move forward resistant to fear charm taunts very powerful indeedhe made a good point they all killed someone to get pass the first scenario even that little kid so if you dont take care of yourself then you dont deserve to live money grabbers jesus fcking christ the audacity of those assholesi cant wait to see inho cheon get whats coming to him relieved_face gonna be even more satisfying than watching little han boy become a mother pregnant_womanedit these arent spoilers this is just what i hope happensthrow myeongeh under the bus he’s got coins nowi love it when the main character doesnt stick to moral values like theyre in the apocalypse and they expect people to still follow the moral code even tho most if not all of then already killed someone i love love love dokja’s character i am incredibly sick of “good” characters that make stupid decisions because “it’s the right thing to do” i’m fed up with the moral high ground obviously he’s not a bad guy either he’s just selfish and i don’t find anything wrong with placing your survival first he is not responsible for these peoplejean henri fabre was a french naturalist in the late s known for his books on the lives of insects if anyone’s curiousis it just me or does dokja get hotter with each passing episode i love how he looks i love how he doesnt take bull look at him hes one of the many reasons why my standards are skyrocketinggod im already so spoiled with this one episode a day lol easily my top series cant wait for morei think the important thing here is regardless of whether or not sharing coins is the moral thing dokja not letting himself be manipulated is better in the long run leaving a mob under incite’s control will only hurt him in the end not to mention giving those coins would be like taking responsibility for those lives it’s too much for anyone to really bare people are saying that he wasn’t keeping a moral high ground or that the people were telling him to keep a moral high ground and he wouldn’t but i think that he’s still got a moral high ground these people the moment they were manipulated or had to think things through resorted to murder and that’s exactly what he expected of them so why give them coins why trust them i think that despite his looks saying ‘neutral chaotic with evil’ it’s more like ‘lawful chaotic with a moral compass’i see dokja as a survivor not good or bad just trying to livefinally this mc action makes sense in an apocalyptic world hes not bad but smarti love how they try to attack him he fights back and their expression is surprised pikachu face i don’t seem to follow why people have been saying this makes them evil they threw their own lives away unable to beat their inner fear and even attempt to survive it would be a waste to save someone like that in fact i’d say saving them just to force them into more suffering would be the evil choice if they are unable to even try and survive for themselves why not just let their suffering end it seems cruel on the surface but dokjas got a point in not being too generous people who live passively and allow themselves to get manipulated by relying on charity and sponsorships wont survive if their supporters suddenly decide to leave them be its true in the scenario and in this reality toodokja is not the protagonist of twsa so he will have to take hard and clever decisions in order to survive this game till the endand its much more fun to see him not following the moral valueshe really does look like a villain in that lase slide its so awesome no wonder the constellations are interested in him coins just means you’re alive one more day to beg for even more coins it’d be a waste hopefully dokja mentions boss man’s moniesalso i love he gave hyunsung lee a shield and lee loves him now they’re bros gotta max out that affinitydokja an actually good main characterseriously as if he’s some high level monster that you can defeat and he’ll just drop coins why don’t they just break some pottery and pray for rupees do they deserve my help its an important question he cant be expected to shoulder the weight of all these people through the whole apocalypse at some point they need to stand up for themselvesi love how the author sets dokja apart while inho says “return the coins to the people” it sounds like he is doing it for the good of the people and dokja’s “and if i refuse” sounds villainess but he’s the main character and it’s refreshing that he isn’t a morally bound person but at the same time hasn’t tipped too far off that has left him insane in this situation this is absolutely one of my favorite webtoons by far and i rarely read anything other than heartwarming and romantic webtoonsfirst they wanted free food next they were too scared to help him kill the giant rats for coins third when they came back they asked for free coins thinking that he would give after that they tried to kill him and expected him to be a sitting duck finally they have the audacity to be surprised that he sliced someones arms offhonestly i love dokja’s character he’s rational and doesn’t let his emotions take the reins over his decisions he’s the embodiment of someone going against the world’s corruption while not utilizing the common “good prevails” trope i’m % looking forward to his journeyhyunsung lee has started to trust youdokja hmmm i can use thisi agree with dokja there’s no reason for him to help these people specially in the situation they’re inthe mc did the right decision because if they can survive just that one scenario how will they survive the next one those people is so pathetic the mc help them for food then they will blamed him for losing of coinsexpressionless_facei don’t need sleep i need the next episodeyay a gray area characterpeople who rely on others too much usually drag down the whole group because they always expect you to save them and feed of the kindness of others in a survival situation you have to either drag them with you and risk getting the whole squad killed or you have to leave them behind to save those who are able to stand alone i think dokja made the right decision because it would mean hed have to take care of a bunch of people even in the future that is not a longterm solutioni feel like dokja is more rational than evil as people are saying he makes smart decisions and calls based on logic everybody is talking about the moral high ground and how hes evil when mans is making rational decisions and being smart hes neither good nor evil hes j a guy with a rational mindthis comics unreleased episodes are starting to make me agree with coins are poweri love dokja’s personality in my opinion he is correct this is the apocalypse and he isn’t obliged to help everyone everyone brought food because they were hungry it’s their own decision what does dokja have to do with it if they wanted coins earn it themselves it’s every man for themselves i love this author already theyre the first to actually show you when the veil of civilization is torn apart by apocalypse even after murdering another person to survive these people are acting dependant on others if they dont fend for themselves no one will fight for them anymore beautiful storytellingthats one the the reasons i really like this story the mc is quite different from the standar hero see-no-evil_monkey ill support him as far as he dont betray his team relieved_faceOK_handdam i caught up to quickly again i’m so happy that’s he’s releasing quickly and with great quality i’ll keep spending coins as long as they keep coming people i know that there are some people who came here from the webnovel but for those of us who are reading it for thw first time on webtoon dont google anything about omnimicent reader because it will just most likely spoil the manwha for you like it did for meedit did anyone else love hyeonseongs face when he was holding the shieldthis is absolutely perfect dokja maintains logical thinking in a time where it would be necissary to do so so it actually makes sense he isnt a hero just a guy a lucky guy but a guy nonethelessnone of you can say that dokja isnt good he doesnt do bad things he just does what is needed to survive moral ground wont work in apocalyptic world he didnt use them he just simply did what was best for him so i really like his decisiondokja badassdokja in the end of the story fucking badass🥴well this is real interesting dokja is a unique protagonist and i absolutely love italthough those background characters are hella annoying for being hypocrites their reactions and actions are all natural i mean who did expect this to happen not even dokja dokja is lucky enough to have knowledge about the overall situation also its understandable as to why theyre afraid to go out for the quest i mean their families and friends didnt come back after they joined something like that true neutral character coming throughas a mother i say kill the greedy bastards and save the children but as a lover of apocalypse stories the kids would get him killedi am now a simp for dokja raised_back_of_handthey only show interest in dokja when they need something from him why should he share his coins with them he made the right call face_with_steam_from_noseyou have me hooked dokja’s decision really gave a sense of reality to the comic most would make their characters be the ‘good’ guy stick to morals and would give themselves to save others dokja is a very rational character and i am excited to see where his story leads him y did i have the biggest smile on my face when he said y should i give u any am i psychodokja really takes no ones shit and i think that’s what makes him such an awesome protagonist like yeah it’s cruel but considering the circumstances he’s got every right to refuse no one else has done anything that deserves his help it’s survival of the fittest people are bound to show their ugly sides no matter whatif i was one of the people there i would be desperate and honestly feel some resentment towards dokja but id also understand that he very much risked his life to get the food and coins he has and i dont have the right to demand him to give me some especially if i havent even tried to risk my life to get them myself so i understand if they feel frustrated but it should be more with themselves and the situation what dokjas doing is perfectly fine and realisticabsolutely love this antihero what a fresh twist looking forward to the lack of romance and high action packed chapter to followi love him hes not evil just logical and fairtheyre all using scrap metal bats tools and pipes as weapons with some waving bone weapons as the highest thing there and this mf pulls out a swordhe risked his own life to get the food of course he is not going to give it all out for freei like a lot dokja just because hes not pretend to be like the hero or something like that hes just acting like the situation are and the instinct of survive the woman’s constellation has to be ariadne right like with the whole thread to get out of the dungeon thing is kinda like her and the labyrinth i mean why should he give them coins when they are threatening him i was wondering how they were going to portray the dokkaebi chat i must say i am thoroughly pleased i love the emoticons face_with_tears_of_joypurple_heartthis webtoon is so amazing the art is some of the best ive ever seen it is so well done i love it the plot is awesome i normally dont like apocalypsethemed stories but this is amazing the characters are fantastic too especially dokja i love how realistic they all are i can tell how hard the authors worked on this and they did truly some of the best work ive ever seen well donedokja me too give me just coins to know what happens next in the story and then give me more and then more and then more then i will pay you back please i just want to see more of your surprising and amazing intellegence and decisions second later rip my arms god i wanna read more why cant this series just be over so i can binge it i love that hes not a hero i get tired of all the high morals and instead hes a survivor this comic is amazing what’s the old saying about jesus “give a man a fish he will that day teach a man how to fish he will eat every day” giving them coins doesn’t solve the issue because what about the next day and day after that they’ll need someone to help them rather help themselves these people complain about morality but dont hesitate to kill people for coins at leat dokjas transparent they all knew about the survival fee yet they still bought so much food that they didn’t have any left for the fee now correct me if i’m wrong but didn’t you get coins for clearing the first situation they had enough coins there alone to survive two days but they bought large quantities of food in order to have it now doesn’t that sound like the sloth and fox sin gluttony and greed screw them dokja is definitely doing the right thing its funny how those people went from pleading for dokjas help to being completely hostile towards him talk about true colors huhunrelated but i swear to god i am screaming about this little boy gilyeong i love you so damn much i dont know what it is but something about him has just stuck in my heart since the beginning and every reaction with dokja just makes my head spin the big brother vibes are killing mehonestly it’s messed up that they’re all so dependent of dokja since he has the food and the coins like damn if yall want some then stop sitting around and get some yourself survival of the fittest and wisest am i right if your kid doesn’t have enough coins or food stop babying himher and teach them to survive not to depend on othersdude is a true capitalistdokja is such a badassin an apocalypse there could have been no better choiceleshgoo im so glad hes not your typical hero he has his own sense of neutrality nd i love that damn it why is he so hotpeople can hate dokja all they wanti still think hes bae weary_facered_heart️raised_handmedium_skin_tonedamndokja is sparklesｆｉｎｅ sparklesah yes this is the type of mc i like relieved_facey didn’t he say that guy with the glasses have coin just ask himface_with_tears_of_joyhes using like a mythical max level weapon on level villagers i love how people were trying to guilt him using morals and then literally two seconds later tried to kill himomniscient reader is the best thing on this universe i completely understand why he chose to do that if he wouldve chosen to give his coins out most of the people would die anyway and he would’ve wasted coins for no reason leaving him with way less coinsits funny how the same people willing to kill to survive are the same ones that ask for coins to survive like get your crazy ideas that world revolves around you under control dokja aint at fault for the fact u domt have survival fee after all u did was sit on your asses and wait for someone else to take care of youi really like where this is headed so many stories have the main character stick to the typical hero plot which there’s nothing wrong with because it always makes a good story but i really like how different this is it’s a way more accurate portrayal of the chaos and the human desire to survive people really wouldn’t be generous in this scenario it really is a fantastic depiction of survival of the fittestthe reason wednesdays exist omniscient readerdokja just became one of my favourite mcsi like this so much i didn’t think he was going to kill someone but you got to do what you gotta do and it’s not some game this is actual survival you already payed for the food so no refunds this is a game of survival and you must think wisely i think everyone can agree it’s so refreshing to have a character who cares about others but also knows to look after themself first can’t wait to see how it develops further thank you author keep up the great workdokja’s character is what’s lacking in solo leveling limits i rly rly like dokjams character the whole series i believe is a gem that needs to be caressed slowly great job author hope it continues to prosper im a caring person but im siding with dokja they dont see that they allowed this situation and are still being manipulatedwhy do i feel like dojka is going to turn into a nuetural good charactercan i just say that sword is real nice dokja sold food for $ while inho sold his food for more why should dokja be responsible for all these people lifes if he isnt even part of the group if inho the leader shouldnt he be responsible for everyone people can lie about how much coins they actually have people already knew about this coin system early so shouldnt they have been responsible with their moneylook our favorite dokkaebi is back🥰🥰🥰its not that he doesnt care at all he just knows that he needs those coins to survive later because he knows the relative future it is his life over others so obviously he has to choose himself no one is going to pay him back laterhyeonseong lee is the type of guy that would never cheat on you relieved_faceanother thing i love about this is that his group stays by him they understand that he doesn’t owe these people anything and he’s not a bad person for refusing to give them food and money i’m glad that they aren’t falling for any of itdokja has made his way to my top favorite badass manhwa characters sitting at # right behind sung jin woothis doesnt make him evil or even neutral as he points out no one here is good and hes resisting the evil manipulation of the incite powerlook ma no handswhy are people trying to get refunds for the food that they already ate lmao im with dokja you foolshow can they ask for a refund after they have already eaten the foodi stan dokja it’s not on him to save everyone do you boo boohe really just said dont touch me or my family at the last scenedaammnnn this is the character ive been looking fooorrr oh sweetcheese dokja imma go marry youloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_facedokja is smart as hellgosh that kid is quite op oh cool sangah have some useful skill too woah so dokja can now collect information on the target character omg the cute evil dokkaebi bihyeong is back oh so the dokkaebi can use telepathy with dokja thats interesting lol the soldier hyeonsyeong is happy with his shield bruh this annoying guy again yes im waiting for you to make your decision too dokja deym he went full cold psycho thats so awesome he even cut that guys arm off clean im so proud of youit’s is time ladies and gentlemen this is what i call sweet fucking satisfaction everyone is like oh he doesnt have morals but thats not true his morality is just different in an alignment chart he would be lawful neutral possibly lawful good compared to everyone else he doesnt believe in giving away things for free the people could offer him something and he would probably agree that doesnt make him morallesshonestly dokja’s character development really resonates with me if i have been put at the edge of my life’s cliff numerous times hanging on with my teeth i’d be sick and tired of people’s shit toooh my— dokja is so— jfjdhskfhdjebdjdndj fire fire fire fire yes yes dokja worked so hard for his coins and he is without any sponsor why should he give them just because they think he shouldnt let them die they killed people without problem to survive the first scenario face_with_rolling_eyeswtf he is hero for his friend and villain for others i love it face_screaming_in_fearface_screaming_in_fearface_screaming_in_fear i love this types of character thank god he’s not like other main characters 🥺person_raising_hand‍female_sign️ dude he’s so cool t^t is intrigued by dokjas choicesnnoo i read all the episodes this is one of those ones where they should make into a showyo i think dokja made the right decision it’s an apocalypse and he has his own to care for plus how many of those people would give up their coins if they were in his situation i’m pretty sure none of them would relieved_faceit’s literally the apocalypse you live on by every decision you make and being nice isn’t going to keep you alive forever dokja did the right thing im honestly in love with dokjas characterdokja in the beginning of the webtoonim not smart or handsomedokja right now is the most attractive character everi smell anti hero development and im here for itsmiling_face_with_smiling_eyesdokja has shown us he’s considerate but he’s not a pushover either when this is your th time reading the comic and it still hasnt gotten oldwell if he would not have sold them food they would be already dead person_shrugginglight_skin_tone‍male_sign️im % with dokja in this why the hell he has to share his coins just because some random dude ask you lmao tbh ill do the same he doesnt have the responsibility for others lifes only for his own survival dokja is one of the best mc ive seen in a while love the line about the killing in the first triallike youre capable of premeditated murder but not to take care of yourself you dont even have to do everything alone you can team up if they didnt just stay in one place roughly % of them would be able to survivehonestly i would have behaved like that too dokja is not selfish just because he isnt being blindly selfless he is strategic because this world is all about survivali love how hes not our typical hero and is a human to be honest if i was in his position i probably wouldnt help them either its a dog eat dog world only the fittest will survive every man for himselfi like how he refuse he earn the coins with hard work and good thinking while those people are desperate to survive but they don’t think outside of the box like dokia in the first scenariodokja is good and evilyes mess them up do not i repeat do not let this sick ass bastered get away with thisits literally not his fault its like attack a stranger because they didnt want to help you with your problems its your life to deal with dokja is such a refreshing main character i feel like most mains are usually true good or true evil but so far id say hes pretty neutral hes so interesting and unpredictabledick leader hey bro dont you have the most coins everyone communism intensifieshonestly i’m happy protagonists should focus on their own survival it’s not realistic to expect someone to sacrifice themselves for a bunch of strangers not to mention ones who have killed innocents to survive forget morality this is spartathanks author how is this comic not popular you need to be appreciated author nice decision he worked hard for those coins those people should’ve worked for coins when they clearly had the chance not leeching of someone else’s coins it is also not even his fault that they don’t have coins from not using it wisely so honestly don’t give me that shit face_with_steam_from_nose fuck i love dokja sm i think dokja is doing the right thing even if the other people think he is being selfish in a survival scenario you cant depend on others to save you the incite guy is banking on dokjas morality forcing him to play nice but survival is the goal not being likedariadne was a princess who gave someone theseus or daedalus i think her magical thread for them to escape a labyrinth im a super greek mythology geek so my theory is sangahs constellation might be ariadne or something its funny how they blame dokja for everything like did he forces you to buy the food or what dokja i’ll give you the coins back if you can undigest all that food you bought from mehe handled that nicelyits funny how similar this is to real capitalism people always seem to demonize people with money because there are needy out there and thus try to take their money through various means just a connection my brain madeoh shi turned him into overhaul rolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingpacifism is a point of weakness in a world where everyone has already killedive never bought any coins or tried to on this app but this story not only made to buy and look for coins but also the only one for which i use all those coins and thats saying something no sorry a lotttbtw i just love dokjas character the right balance of good and evil he knows when to be good and when not to be he doesnt follow common guide lines or general society morals which are dubious at times like thesei read it in the novel but i still get irritated and upset with this scene kim dokja may sound selfish but everyone else needs to be responsible for their own lives giving them fish for today wont help them tomorrow ironically i have ran out of coins so now i have to waitthe constellation the reader of a thousand webtoons gives dokja a bro fist of approvalare you jeanhenri fabre or something bahahahahahaha amazing face_with_tears_of_joyaslal is really interested in every decision dokja make she has become a fan of yours here’s your five coin bro we all just people spending money to read will we all heard this qoute if you make this a game ill show you how its played thats how exactly how he manage to not keep going to his game plan i love it and im still willing to waste more coinsstrong escanor vibes^°^well at least this webtoon is close to reality in terms of attitudeim done with hypocrite characters so always have those high values that sometimes it doesnt feel real at all i cannot express how much i love protagonists like dojka a person’s bound to get tired of mary sues at some point pensive_facei love moral grey points in post apocalypse i hate seeing the goody twoshoes in these situations its literally kill or be killed everyone there has taken a life so they dont deserve true sympathyall yall getting heated in the comments coz dokja aint fit your standards of high morality theyre all murderes lmao dokja raised a very good point on “they can’t even take responsibility for their own lives” so why would dokja be responsible for their lives… yes it would be kind and generous of dokja if he’s willing to give it to them for free but for him this is survival of the fittest and he earned those big money because of his smart thinkingstrategy he has the right to refuse as selfish and cruel as it sounds them trying to leech on him forcibly and badmouthing him when they aren’t even——be nice and give these murderers you dont even know some of your life line and risk you and your own groups safety and survival to make these people who just sit in a corner till someone comes whom they can leech off on survive hours then leech off on you again next time cuz youre nice yeah sure no shtpff to be completely honest i wouldve been worse in dokjas situation like i dont know why i should save them i dont mind being called the villain i just protect those people i value and im not about to risk nor sacrifice the chances of our survival to murderers i barely knowi love it when the mc is neither a hero or a villainbro wjy is he so hotim beginning to like this man i think i’m in love right now i would just mention that this fella right here killed a demon and got coins as reward so one of your men now has enough coins to save everyone sheesshhh mah guy turn to erenok but bihyeong was so cute in that one panel xddhe watched his own hands wave him goodbye waving_handlight_skin_tone face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyrolling_on_the_floor_laughingface_with_tears_of_joyi might sound wicked but i really liked how he reacted smiling_face_with_hornsim still not done reading the novel but dang i love dokjas character so much but once again none of these people tried to hunt monsters and complete the task like bruh theyre just a bunch of leeches and the spirit said that coins will be drawn daily even if they had it for the night they wouldnt have any for the next night and they still wouldnt try to go kill monstersrn my favorite constellation is prisoner of the golden headbandthat moment when u are done playing the good guy routethis is definitely an interesting scenario nice to see bihyeong again toochaotic neutral lol well hes not evil bc all of these people are murderers too lol even worse theyre entitled ones who did it wo thinking in the first taskgrimacing_facedokja is really right i mean they taken someone elses life for their survival and now they arent ready with their life to be taken thats so ridiculous lol dokjas a chaotic neutral typehe is being realistic tho im sick of mc who is always trying to be goody two shoes its an apocalypse who tf in their right mind would want to help others lets be reali think dokja is a complex morally grey character i like those typesam i the only one having a deja vu of kirito from saoits their fault that they dont have coins leeching off of other people and then blaming a guy who worked hard for his coins no thanks face_with_rolling_eyesraised_back_of_handmedium-light_skin_tonetheyre just pretending to have a high morality high morality yet illogical face_with_rolling_eyes buzzing excuses without even thinking justice should be served who cares about morality when it’s about your survival feels good to see a mc that doesn’t want to be a hero all the time“i want a refund” bruh you’re saying you want to uneat food you yourself had chosen to survive by tf lmaomorally grey characters are the most interesting imo im interested to see how dokjas personality and choices influence the original storygod mode has been activated that dude deserved it tbh that sword just cut through flesh ligaments veins and fricking bones in just one clean slice thats literally impossible its an upswing toohyeongsong lee is so smiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyesdamnnn dokja is seeming to be more malevolent now even the art is making him look evil wonder if his allies will keep supporting him though they didnt seem like theyd want to share their coins either sangah seems reminiscent of ariadne from the greek myths so im wondering where shell stand tooeven the constellations were speechless flushed_faceholy shit this is so refreshingdokjas principles astonished_faceastonished_faceastonished_face○○ that was hotwow i think hes going to be an anti hero i love how he cut off that guys arms with hesitation these peoples hypocrisy is just so real to me if ever this apocalypse happens the audacity to be guilt tripping someone to greed over their lives when that persons already trying to survive himself too you have been gifted coinsi just like how much he fking loves his new shield yes an mc that doesn’t stick to the morals ‘help everyone’ also they know what theyre doing with the cliffhangers lmaoaoaogive me your hard earned coins so i can survive i dont deserve to die did you kill another human being to get here um yes then screw off thumbs_uplight_skin_tonebrohe arms wentyeet skullthese people are the most unreliable if he helped them now then later they would probably betray him when the odds are against him dokja is seriously my number character and development i agree damn well with his choices i would do the same its the apocalypse not a guy begging on the street i dont mean that rudely btwi love this because he just stick to surviving that’s all sure he may be doing some wrongs but also some right he is more balance if anything i dig dokja hes more in a grey area instead of being a goodytwoshoes a lot of protagonist with his powers and knowledge would use them too much and create more problems for themselves im glad a lot of webtoons seems to promote this kind of less predictable protagonistdokjas face expressions coupled with his black shirt was really hot dokja is against communism dokja isnt a hero nor is he a villain hes a survivor doing whatever it takes to live and give the people he cares about the opportunity to survive without taking care of themyou know what i think he is making the right decision its there fault for being greedyunamused_face love the twist btwgrowing_heartafter reading this comic my eyes are still shining from excitement 🤩 think about it those people are getting what they deservedokja is the most fair of all them it may seem a little too drastic but giving that people coins would be like giving thousands of money to murderers bc of the first scenario im so happy there is finally a character that dont care about what the others think that is fair and trust on their own point of viewdokjamy guyi simp for youi just wanted you to knowi definitely love dokja being a real one giving coins to everyone doesn’t help anybody what a masterpiece of a webtoon weary_facethe last panel was literal fire dokjas squad are preparing to destroy those idiotsthis webtoon is so much like the novel such a loyal recreation so fardokja nah frick you i have excaliburthey paid him fairly for food and get mad that he stole his money he just went and got food like any of them couldvethe constellation webtoon fangirl is very intrigued i’m curious to see how dokja’s party thinks of this them ppl thought dokja was pussy face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy the entitlement of all of them as if he had to help them because why to be a good person please they all sat around on their asses instead of trying to fend for themselves and expect him to give out his resources he earned for free byeee aint his fault since he didnt force you guys to buy the foodshit i love this webtoon i think im addicted to iti like dokjas thinking all those people literally killed other people to make it this far but now act like their the victims at the hands of his mercy if they were ready to kill other people for survival they are responsible for their own survival as well its also unlikely for them to survive anyway if they dont stop to rely on other people and they literally had the choice to either try finishing the scenario or die because of lack of coins the first might have even provided some coinshonestly what are they gonna do to him if he doesnt share in a matter of minutes theyll all be dead anyways soi love his character its real who would want to share his live freely with someone he didnt know survival of the fittest bitch you adapt or you die face_screaming_in_fearface_screaming_in_fearface_screaming_in_fear me likey smirking_face and thats how this became my favorite webtooni love that do you have a death wish or something look at the end OK_handdokja doesnt have time for your bs dude here i am the person who read the novel patiently waiting to see kyrgioschaotic neutralwait until you see what he become in the futurewhat i find interesting is that these people who are themselves killers trying to hold dokja to a moral high ground like bishyup inho needs to see he ain’t the boss and the people need to see that inho has been mooching off of them parents with little kids children women have it rough in scenarios like these but even dokja knows that he needs to cull thieving menaces to be of real help and that dude that got violated by a demon seems to not have learned his lesson either the point is that all the people in this scenario are murders they have killed someone to be in this scenario for them to be asking for coins as if it is the moral thing to do is ridiculous it depends on who actually deserves to be helped sangahs ability reminds me of the legend of theseus and the minotaurim glad the main character is basically saying fck you im tryna survive too aint no charity in these streets this is just life the rich people dont hand out money we work for our coinsi think his point is justifiable he straight up asked why do you deserve his coins prove it get them this is the apocalypse being friends wouldnt help you survive for long relieved_faceto be honest dokja is the type of person who is alone but when it comes to lifethreatening situations he would do anything and help anyone if it benefits him as well the type of people dokja is helping are the type to giveandtake they are all compatible in there small group that dokja made they help each other out on the other hand inho cheon who dont give any fs and use other people i would also like to see inho cheon face when that man hands got cut of by dokjaalso dokja legit is getting food and this is what they do the respect he might point out that the got who killed the monster has coins and that the guy leading them didnt seem worried so he must have plenty of coins to sparedear santa please give me coins so i can read the next chapter i promise ill be good remember people to heart this chapter lets appreciate the characters uniqueness red_heart️killin old ladies one moment and begging for mercy the next naaww bruhs im good ah chaotic good i am familiar them give us our coins back dokja ¯\\_ツ_¯ survival of the fittest ¯\\_ツ_¯dokja is looking out for his newly formed family notice how he was telling his new kid brother not to use his ability until he tells him to or how he lets the girl know not to tell anybody about her contract or how he got a shield for his buddy it seems to me hes looking out not just for himself but his friends oh and love the back and forth with the dokabilmao i just realized something coins are the most powerful thing in that world and this is the same for us people who have enough coins can fastpass while us peasants are left to die in boredom and impatience lewlthe moral high ground has no meaning when the first thing you had to do to survive was take another lifehe just had enough of your shitthank you for the realism when your life’s at stake there’s no time for a moral high grounddouble_exclamation_mark️double_exclamation_mark️help me i have a serious thing for dokjai feel like you could never stick to a moral high ground in an apocalyptic universe people are gonna die and you want to survive what you have to do to survive may not he the most morally good thing to do but thats lifei like dokja’s way of thinking it’s not the typical “hero” personality that he’s got but at least he thinks rationally depending on the situation they are in stan dokja place_of_worshipdid they think theyd survive if it werent for dokja giving them the food what do they think is dokja to them their nanny ofc hes gonna ask you to pay for shit nothing is free in this world nothing i really do love dokjas character to death hes not the usual annoyingly good guy mc and even the protagonist of the story isnt nice theyre human and it shows i love how much this webtoon shows the flaws of us living beings i also would do the same thing hes smart cunning and selfish plus he tells it how it is like why should i give up my coins for yall when that has nothing to do with me he reminds me of myself and i love iti think dokja is a good person he does help people when he can like heewon but theres a line between nice and stupidty he cant just sacrifice himself for everyone else in such an insane world it really forces your true self out of you i like how this mc isnt just gonna blindly follow we must help others sharing is caring~ like many other mcs do another example of an mc i think is similar to dokja in the above stated manner is medea from your throne dokja sure is one hell of an interesting character huhi love how realistic kind of dokja is i mean his personalitydokja had to risk his life in many situations in order to earn that many coins it’s his right to keep those coins to himself instead of giving it to people that sat around in a safe zone waiting for coins and food while others went out and risked their lives for coins and food person_shruggingokay but seriously how many of them killed to survive the first round only thise who didnt deserve it and honestly survival of the fittest and his friends he and his crew went out and earned those coins they didnt kill a single person eitheridk why people think the protag is evil in the first game he saved the child when he had no reason to and he also saved the woman from the poison when yet again he had no reason to it just so happens that they were useful the child was not in the webtoon that he was reading and the woman was but he had no idea who she wasim just waiting for the constellation secretive plotter to reveal that heshe is the author of twsano shits were givenbro what abt the suit guy he has like coinsthe ad i got at the end of this episode just so happened to be a snickers adself defence moral high ground they took lives why should he save theirs i dunno still pretty high morals and he attacked only when his life was in danger person_shrugging‍female_sign️ it’s not all so black and whitedealing with people is exhausting irl and even in apocalypseare we just gonna ignore hyeongseong lee being adorable after polishing his shieldright if you need coins get them for yourself dokja literally fights everytime while the others just wait for food and coins its an apocalypse i dont like it morally but i do agree with him since he did earn the coins and this is life or death he cant rlly be charitable in this kind of situation yep im addicted ddokja was like nah this an apocalypse not a charity fearful_facefearful_facefearful_face dokja sometimes is really scary i want a refund huh lol ok karen i want a refund when you ask for a refund you gotta bring back what you bought no then give the food back oh you cant not his problemdude theres literally a survival fee for everyday say dojka gave away all these coins for the people ok and then what he cant do this everyday so theyre going to die anyway like bruh hes not even being evil i played way too much etrian odyssey to not recognize an ariadne thread when i see one face_with_tears_of_joyooh what a powerful boy we got therei love grey charactersthat army guy is so cute when he wipe that shield smiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_closed_eyessmiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_closed_eyessmiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_closed_eyesskfjfjsjfjj why am i so into the whole morally grey mc trope weary_face especially when they got that iq OK_hand🤌 like medea muah chefs kissthings have gotten so interesting i misread have you all been well and saw it have you all been in hellluke skywalker would be proud i love me some psychological warfarethis is survival anything goes if only you hadnt bought excessively then none of this wouldve happened he may look like hes making heartless decisions but its simply survivallol our favorite doakabi is backi mean even if he went full on humanitarian and gave away every single scrap he still couldn’t save everyone in rescue training they teach you never to put yourself in a position of unnecessary risk bc you’ll just increase the number of people needing rescuedsame idea here some degree of selfishness required im satisfied with dokjas decisionmorally grey characters are my weaknesswhy isnt anyone talking about bihyeong he was hilarious and adorable that wink and that totally innocent whistlingso chaotic neutral character niceother readers i love this doods attitude me yay bihyeongs backa character with common sense and isnt an asshole im hooked now dokja is so badass im here for itbruh the kid in the back is lookin just as evil as dokja he like mfer deserved it person_shruggingmedium_skin_tone‍male_sign️im kind of happy a little sad that some kids will die but these people cant seem to understand that this world now revolves in a different way and dokja will ride the wavesim glad that dokja didnt give infck that dumb face inho i wannaunamused_faceoncoming_fist himi love how this dude really keeps targeting dokjahe doesnt even help them out himself just using their misfortune to manipulate them no more kind dokjai like how dokja has gone from “i am a normal person” to “i am a super genius” to “why should i give a shit if you live or die” over the course of ~ chaptersin a situation where you dont need morals to survive i like that attitudehehhes so hot god i need a minutethe look in his eye is crazy and i love itcheckmate communists yesyesyes yes kill them alli love it when the mc turns evilooo goddamn dokja is becoming a morally grey character someone who isn’t good but not baddokja is my new religion 🧎‍female_sign️honestly i get it why sacrifice for people who leech off of you and kill you the first chance they get the best thing to do while they still had plenty time wouldve been to try to fulfil the scenario with the strongest leading the charge or with inho inspiring the others but unfortunately those in charge are selfish cowards im glad he chooses to be selfish cause for what reason he wanna give them the coins in this time you should save yourself first before save other people yay the little crazy creature is bk and l love dokia face is like a crazy person laughing to himselfthis webtoon is awesome the main character is very progressive and hyper aware of the situation i love it hey uh dokja got cake all these people survived by murdering someone if anything they shouldn’t even talk about sharing and having morals i think dokja’s decisions are right i think morally he is doing the “right” thing to survive what about what’s his face that received coins for finishing off the demon couldn’t he sharei love how dokja thinks fck morals be smart this is why i love antihero main characters am i the only one who laughed when the guy looked back at his falling armseyes it was funny to me im not sadistic tho lolif this was real life than id probably have to think about my personal morals and the situation a bit before siding with dokja but since this is fiction im satisfied as hell with whats happening right now go dokja dugh man i read it to fast now i have to waitsmiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_cold_sweatcrying_faceooh yes i love dokja hes one of the best characters ive seen in webtoon so fareveryones gonna forget that coins that evil rich dude got for slaying the monsterwould have been funny if he said that the annoying ex workmate had just won coins just wondering what would have happened then p holy fudge this is the mc that ive been looking forthis has nothing to do with the webtoon but long live the demon kinghe’s not rude he’s just being smart all these ppl would never give him if they hadperiod they would never and we all know that so ya why would he dokja is the one character whos neither too kind and good to be true neither evil and ruthless hes smart and wise its so refreshing to see such a character and well ofc hes climbing up the d best list too quicklyomg make this an animeawooga bark bark grryesss love a good chaotic neutral character i wonder what the backstory of that kid did since the first scenario is to kill an organism i wonder if he killed a person or something else the kid as in one of the woman’s kidi love it when my main characters go chaotic neutraldid anyone notice huwons traits is about to blossom hope she doesn’t become a mass murder like dokja said she mightplease make this an animei like how the authors made clear dokja its not a piece of cake by making him cut both arms of the thug at once no joking aroundi love this i cant even writehe went from zero to badass in secondsill call it as a realistic smart and pratical good character dokja is the epitome of true neutral im really curious to see how his friends are going to react for him doing that in a survival speaking it was a really good choice if your point in that time is to survive then morals and feelings are useless however in a human way of seeing this situation no matter what you tell yourself there is this feeling of morality that tells you what he did was wrong to those persons who are just trying to live and you shouldnt be with him so it becomes a huge psychological conflictdokjas perfect retaliation this is why its one of the top webtoonsthey all asked so nicely for the coins and food before but when hes finally being a little selfish because there his coins they all just try to kill him like dude he gave away all of his food and risked his life to find more and this is what they resort to loloriginal sin i think it refers to the deadly sin pride inho the b@st@rd lust the guys that tryna rape girls by luring them back in the early ep greed them hovering over dokjas food and money sloth them be just sittin there waiting for food wrath inho and the people attacking dokja envy cursed dude envying dokja for its achievements gluttony idkyeah this decision seems logical to me person_shruggingmedium_skin_tone‍female_sign️new world new rules even on normal world there is no good people and evil people there is survival your mind own sense od justicethis webtoon is a war between my “work together to survive” mentality vs my “give no shits cause they don’t deserve it” mentality it’s getting so fucking goodour coins what i find funny is how they all say they want a refund but they already ate all the fooddokja really said f in the chat to the people who cant pay for it eyemoutheyei want dojak to turn the tables besides none of this fee stuff would have happened if greedie boy over there didnt stockpile foodlove when main characters go semi dark in these situationsi really shouldn’t be laughing this hard face_with_tears_of_joy dokja really is the definition of true neutraldojka in the last panel left me with shivers down my spinei would have turned it around i would have said okay but only if you and your group redistribute your own coins first lets see your status screen and the other search party members and have you pay off as much as possible then i can pay the remainder that should be fair since i havent officially joined this group yet and have been attacked twice already dont delay too long of you want everyone to surviveim eagerly waiting for the next episode dokja is not a hero known for his heart of gold and his bravery hes just another player with a distinct advantage he has intricate knowledge of the game world and he has to use that knowledge wisely im sure he doesnt want people to die but theres no point in killing himself for them so early in the game he might give them a chance if he deems them worthy of joining his party but thats about it dokja is so freaking cool because he is not one of those goodygoody always do whats right and angelic and kind at your own expense kind of character but he is not just a straight up kill everyone and make explosions for no reason but to cause suffering kind of character either it is so amazing and i love itit was the people decision to buy the food in the first place then they crazy cause they don’t have the coins to survive anymore tough luck man person_shrugging‍male_sign️i think dokja is chaotic neutralhe did the right decision i would of done the same or just not returnyou see those mental gymnastics right there first they blame dokja for all their problems then they expect him to fix their problems and then expect him to just sit their and let them jump him hilarious hahaha the fine line between morality vs justice it may not be morally right to not help those people but they put themselves in that position so it would be unjust to dokja if he were to selflessly sacrifice what he had earned himself it’s all oh so sweet gotta love dokja my man clapping_handsmedium-light_skin_toneclapping_handsmedium-light_skin_toneclapping_handsmedium-light_skin_toneit isnt morality its justice what have they done to deserve the coins its just stupid the next time they need to pay the fee they wont have any coins because there aren t helping nor going out for supplies btw black shorted hair girl is waifu uwui was getting tired of him playing along for the love of god its the fcking apocalypsei really like this character development unlike other main characters this make apocalypses more realistic i hope dokja knock some sense into those people against inho or even themselves they let themselves get into a position where inhos group has power over them it may not be the best decision for dokja but it may have been a wise oneyes finally an mc in dealing with these kind of scenarios the way i want them too no more playing the hero and saving people who dont need to be saved or will just flip on you at the drop of a dime my god the adrenaline kick from this episode love it anyway i really hope this gang stays as allies relieved_facerelieved_facehm so dokja is a gray characteri

didnt get to eat bc it got confiscated and also they didnt huntthey cant just stick or think someone will do things for them to survivethen they have the audacity to ask for coins when all they do is complain best mc everof course those people deserve coins but if they’re all clamoring and running up towards him violently he can’t give them to anyone since he doesn’t even have enough coins in addition they are only thinking of themselves when doing this trying to attack him saying that he needs to give them coins because they need them more than him because it’s evil to do otherwise they act out of selfishness so why can’t dokja act out of selfishness too this is the apocalypse i badly want an animation of this webtoon i know it will and i cant for itsneezing_facesneezing_facedokja is right all of these people killed someone else to clear the first scenario now why they are asking him for help thats not how you survive fellas you go dokja as long as he is not betraying anyone he is finebihyeong in the background looking adorable and secretly chatting with dokja is precious best thing ever bihyeong is my fave even though hes a cosmic being that basically runs a torture channel ruining lives and hes not actually like a good guy i guess but whatevs he fictional and sometimes lovelyi think he just wants to see who attacks him and help out the restthe satisfaction when undeserving people dont get what they want flushed_facepersonal attribute of a badassits nice to have a main character who thinks rationally and makes the right decision i love reading his thoughts because they analyze the situations clearly if they cant take care of their own lives what right did they have to take others anyways even if he gave them coins today they will ask for more tomorrowthis is basically equity vs equality should we all receive the same or should we all achieve the same levelyes thats exactly what i wanted to see this webtoon just climbed up the ranks of my top with a gigantic leapeveryone who is saying dokja is gonna be a bad character kind of person i will say these are his survival tactics if he just agrees to everything other people say then whats the profit in reading twsa he needs to be one of the protagonist that i feelit feels to me like dokja is going to walk a weird sort of moral grey area and apply pressure on both sides to survive i like thisok but suit man has like k coins someone let them knowwhy does he let blond main group leader live he kills for lessthis is totally interesting survival story where moral ground is in conflict with survival of the charactersfinally tbh i would of been done killed someone bro like fr idc let me be the villain that is full and is rich off coins i earned my fair share should of read the book sucks to suck tell on the so called leader that bastardit would have been seriously idiotic if dokja had chosen otherwise usually all the protagonists try to be heroic and hold on to their morals and stuff with the stupid self sacrificing personality but dokja is straightforward legendary and his face in that panel why should i give you any was so badass it’s nice to have heroes that act selfish once in a while it’s quite refreshing to see the people’s faces like “what but we wasted our money on your food refund” i’m like “bruh if you can’t return the food in one edible piece why should he give back the coins”you dont care about him so why would he care about you unamused_faceohohohohohoits not censoreddokja keeps showing traits of maybe why his destiny chose him to hold more power in the times of apocalypse people deserve love mercy and sharing to prosper together but dokja also knows how to find the true deserving ones when you go to attack someone you should expect them to fight back he has more coins than all of you for a reasonnow this is what a protagonist should bewell frick why does dokja have to be so hot and cool help me pls somebodyyou don’t need to set yourself on fire to keep other people warm greedy people just take and take there’s no end to it one day it’s this another it’s that i’m glad he’s not giving in it’s rare to see a main character not maintain morals this series is so original and well written and honestly i hope it gets its own animeme who needs coins to feed the next episodewhen u try to roleplay a true neutral pc on dungeons and dragonsfinally a main character who isn’t always niceoh i like him more and more why should dokja share his coins if they didnt even earn them everyone literally wants everything for free and its patheticyess a protagonist makes a practical decision he looks dead on the insidehe literally disarmed that guythis was a ratherdisarming episodethread and labyrinth huh i think her sponsor is a greek mythdokja yesss you will not be fooled by that evil manokay but why is the dokkaebi so cutethis webtoon is so amazing i do not regret fast passing lee hyeonseong lee hyunsung whatever spelling your name is lmao you precious bean i wanna protect you with my life i wanna wrap you in a blanket and sing you lullabies this webtoon always makes me coins spendin and im not regretting it aahhh this nigga rawdokja gives a lesson stand up for urself u always gonna be kind to everyone then u gonna get urself killed limit ur kindness ^_^the fact that i have to wait is killing me but this is now my new favorite series fast pass isnt fast enough if you reached the last available episode neutral_facei like how dokja is a true neutral character not a protagonist but also not a villain he doesn’t hurt or help anybody he doesn’t have to with exceptions lol and i am excited to see where his character development goes from here finally i feel bad for the guy who got his arm cut off but damn that is one effective way to settle a crowd and get them to listen real quick even if only for a minute it could make all the difference is this man just going to straight up murder the leader damn i hope sovote dokja for most savage man of not even someone just spare me more coins i promise ill pay you back just more to make it to the next scenariowelp now i’m officially going bankrupt thank you webtoonssharin ain’t carin in face_with_medical_maskexcited to see a well written anti hero these are so hard to cone by these daysi see dokja being a grey area character not necessarily evil but not good either hes just true neutral people kill the man who survived the subway dokja deletes a mans arms please do continue to try if you want to diethat’s insane he’s giving out coins in trade for handsi love dokjathis is not a handy situation its all out of hand and in the palm of chaos but this story is finger licking goodcame to comment on how much i like having a neutral main character but so did everyone else face_with_tears_of_joyoh boy he’s not playing around anymorewhy cant they release two chapters a day they got me fcked up having to wait eyespouting_facepouting_face also i love homegirl that asked for the sword lol bish has no chill and i love it she is def gun be a bad ass character raised_fistmedium_skin_toneoncoming_fistmedium_skin_toneanger_symbolthatll be me when i stop acting nice to everyone and smilingdokja is right why would he give his coins for them if he gave his coins they will just be thankful at first but the system will collect coins and the cycle will repeat again its % waste he dont even know or owe them theyre parasites and you wouldnt want parasites stick on you and extract all you have until you have nonei’m not gonna put dokja on a pedestal for cutting the guy’s forearms off but i will say this is getting pretty interesting slayyy dokja as you shouldhe always think logically i love his characterim so addicted to this webtoonwhat high morality and shit dokja collected all those coins himself he risked his life to get the foods too if anything its those leechesthat went from please give us some of your coins~ to kill him and get his coins from him real quickdokja is just keeping it if they wanted to live they couldve gone out and put the work in instead following a prick who just talks all the damn time dokja earned his coins he owes nothingwhy do they want a refund i mean they bought it and ate itskulli mean think about it what would happen in the long run its just like that saying you can give a man a fish but you can teach how to fish and hell fish for the rest of his life its not exactly like that but in the future they wont have enough coins either and he cant just keep giving them coins that will get him killedyk i love it when characters drop the good deeds and decide that they dont wanna deal with any of the bs hes also got a point as well and yeah majority of the people were asses anyway who killed to survive in the first scenario but now theyre all going up to dokja and beg him for coins and shit im excited to see where this is going and him slicing the dudes arms man ive never been so satisfiedreally love dokja so much sick and tired of mcs who are like “ohhh yeah i’m a good guy lets share some shit” he is like nah bitches not happening lmaodokja believes in justice so hes right to ask why if u have bad intentions why should he helphes so hotthis is why i love dokja rolling_on_the_floor_laughingred_heart️if its not just me but why do i feel like dokja is not normal either… from the start where he instantly knew how to use his bookmark and hi calm demeanor while facing people deaths its not normal it feels like he knows something but i couldn’t explainoh yey ~ theres a difference to logic and morality thats why philosophers always grind their brains with ethics coz they have different values and principles with survival as the main objective being charitable kills even the recipients not just the giverbihyung is back lol but he looks so cuteeven im scared and pleased to his decision its just so good that the author makes the plot twist excitingdokjas decision was realistic idk the right term for that bcs i mean they are all fighting for survival being righteous and kind would actually bring them nowhere or something like that dang i should work on my vocabularyomg im so in love with his attitudethat last panel chillsmc so bad assthis is refreshinghyeongseong is a big softiehahah i like how his arms got chopped off they are saying that he is a bad guy but all of the survivors are bad people for what they have done so they shouldnt even say a person is bad because their is no good peopledokja lookin hot there wtfam i the only one who missed the dokkaebi and thinks its cuteno just me okayexpressionless_faceok damn that was hothes kinda like a prantagonisti would have just murdered anyone who tried to take the coins no moral high ground in this universe screw you inhothey want to get coins easier than accomplishing the scenariosthe best way to describe dokja is dark heror thought their methods are cruel they always do whats justicethis is exactly what i expected him to do in the previous episode people should learn not to blame others for their errors eren likethis is actually a depiction of the sad reality people will blame you for their own misfortune they will ask you things and if you wont give it to them they will blame you for the things they couldnt attain bc of the loss of that something when in fact they couldve made a way to get that something dokja is so hot grrokay look if he gave them coins just for free like he’s not getting anything in return free he’s giving them a free pass they will end up just sitting there with their hands outreached waiting for you to put the next thing in their palm they have to earn it even now you have to work for everything so like they’re not just gonna be given a free pass even the child was like “im not gonna be useless” and got skills to help and actually helped that’s not a lack of morals or empathy disarming a grunt with ] has taken and is impressed with the hard decision] i wonder if he could have gained any traction by mentioning the incite ability people hate being manipulated once they know then again that would probably be showing his hand too muchantiheroduhyeah like they killed another person to save themselves and now they want him to save them without any profitwhy should hesmirking_facewhat about the dude with over coins did he diemama got a point though it’s not his fault you’re there thinking_faceokay but why did he seemed so hot like i can’t handle one more fictional crushthings are about to get interesting uhonestly they don’t have any right to make others stick to morality if they themselves have thrown theirs away also that inciteful fellow is annoying too and i’m excited to see the tables turndamn i just started reading this for just coins but its so addicting lolhe is starting to get the dripi just want someone to look at me like the tank is looking at his shield maybe its just me trying to justify it but i think when he said something to the effect of they all took a life but couldnt take responsibility for their own he knew most of these people didnt even look for an alternative theyre people who wouldnt help him were their positions reversed not after consideration consciously just out of pure cowardice the way people make excuses not to help others every day when theyre easily in a position todokkaebi communication you mean when you and your friend are in the same room texting each otherre reading this was worth it ahh my cute bihyeong is backkkloudly_crying_faceheart_suit️to be fair he never has stuck to a moral high ground not in the slightest he has been doing everything as if he wasn’t actually in the situation himself he is doing everything in order to make the constellations want to pay attention to him fulfilling his end of his contractcame here to get free coins and got a nice webtoon to read winwin situation at its bestglowing_starthis hole coin situation is kinda funny when i realize im reading this for free coins in the app these idiots they were the ones who were going to steal food from dokja and now their mad because he gave it to themdude dokja tho firefirefirefire get em for some reason my brain sometimes automatically reads dokja as doja cat thank u he same situation happened to me obviously not as dangerous but still i was playing and online game and i traded stuff for a rare item and the next day the girl wanted it back i was like no it was a fair trade if u wanted to keep ur items then dont trade theminteresting a john henry fabre reference i highly recommend his book on entomological science the insect world its such a fun book face_with_stuck-out_tongue_&_closed_eyesaye why is that mf mr han siding with the other guy after all that hardship dokja went through to save him unamused_facedamn hes so badass weary_facegive me some dokkaebi plushie pleasegilyeong lools like the child of dojka and the brown haired woman that has the same colored has as gilyeong sorry if im spwlling it wrongoohh im excited to see where this goes love the change of his mood humans are so pathetic just blaming someone else always he giving off that bad bitch energy i love this story so damm much ughthat last pannel scares the hell outta medokja is about to be the ultimate grey area lolllfkki like this side mci think dokja is doing the right thing if you want to survive an apocalypse you don’t really try to protect everyone around you this isn’t a game it’s life survival of the fittest my dudesfrankly when trying to survive you can only look after yourself and your loved ones in good times or bad you can share what you can but if i had myself to look after i would be the same and im a really giving person you gotta be smart and dokja isso glad the mc isn’t a generic trash that tries to have a moral high groundi fucking love dokja hes one of the best mc out there he sees no need in having a high moral ground its a damn apocalypsei literally love this character its ok to be badsmiling_face_with_hornsi like how both dokja and the station ppl are to blame for their situation right now the reason theyve run out of coins is bc they gave it to dokja and now everyone is pointing fingers at him its a kindness of dokja to even think of sharing his food to them this webtoon is just amazing cant wait to read moreಠдಠ﻿yeeaahh lets goi meani would’ve done the sameface_without_mouthlike dude you ain’t gonna remember me tomorrow for what i do today when you were already up with a rod to kill me nowperson_shrugginglight_skin_tone‍female_sign️ive decided since im a six foot six giant in real life my constellation will be named giant of moralityi’m enjoying the fact dokja isn’t falling for that guys manipulative ways so muchh a little too much if i may addwhy didnt the mc just say that the glasses guy has more coins than him like glasses guy literally has kyes pop off on em dokjadojka is a good character its the others who are bad and i see alot of people saying dojka is being bad and its cool yes hes not helping others whore not even trying he did help them earlier by giving them food for a cost money is a convenient tool for people and theyve just relied on it anyways like he said the first scenario was themed on original sin so it makes sense for everyone else to be sinfulsome people here really makes me wanna slap my phonevery interesting strokes nonexistent beardi think were entering the corruption arc thinking_facei love the mc so much holy shti’m glad he isn’t sticking to the moral high ground because i’m sure that guy that’s using incite would just use dokja until he was completely worn down it’s probably why the other protagonist left the subway immediately as well if he gives k coins today then he’d have to give money again tomorrow and the next day because this group is just sitting arounddamn mc badass level skyrocketed from to a freaking but thats kinda cruel honestly i dont know what id do in this situation smiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_cold_sweatsmiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_cold_sweatsmiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_cold_sweatokay cause dokja was definitely justified in doing that all of these people have no problem turning on him if they had the opportunity so don’t bring this moral crap on him nothing is free you need to work for these things so accept your fate or try to change and earn those damn coinsi really like the original sin dynamic herenow heres a character i can relate to honestly im sick of characters who always stick to the white side in a gray world theres no black and white really love dokjasht just went from to real quickdamn the kids power is strong never expected him to be able to connect to a monster that size

and cant take care of their own like thats factsperson_facepalminglight_skin_tone‍female_sign️person_facepalminglight_skin_tone‍female_sign️person_facepalminglight_skin_tone‍female_sign️who else hopes this will be adapted into an anime in the near futureim crying from pure fucking happiness i cant belive how good this is bringing back memories from when i read the novell t^tguys remember to like the chapterim laughing cause the regular main characters be like we need to uphold the moral standpoint and share while dokja just be like pay up btches~ i dont fcking care if you die only me and my friends can survive for almost free~ like oh my god~ xd he is like an anti hero or like one of those people you think are more logical than moralsome villains but are actually the main characteraka drstone you have been gifted coins aa hes so hoti am really really happy for dokja he turned it out amazingly i am waiting for the next episodesmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyesfck yesdokja woke up and chose violence and i love itbro that sword is so coolthis is is just too good ive spent my night reading thisloudly_crying_facedon’t these people know it was their choice to buy food from him you can’t get your money back with out giving the product back dummiesgoo dokja he doesnt owe them anything when they treated him so badly dokja kinda looking like a psycho at the end there and i kinda i like itthe secret is that the coins they use is the coins us readers use to buy fast passeswinking_facedammnn dokja you rulei agree with dokjas logic why should someone that killed someone else to save themselves get coins from him for free what makes them so deserving of the coins also the food he had hed gathered for himself and was even willing to sell it to them they were not obligated to buy it nor was it his fault when it disappearedhonestly i would do the same in this situation being pushed around by the incite ability can only go as far as you let itdokja just killed a strong monsterwhat are these puny humans gonna do to him lol gtfohes simply just thinking about his own future theres nothing wrong with that people already do it in this world but are more corrupt about it damn manz tryna live dudei thought he would tell them that the glasses clown has coins but this might be better since even if all of these people manage to get past this round theyre guaranteed to die on the next round anyways lolfinally a character not scared of anything take their arms off kingwhy should you share you grabbing other people shit without asking to borrow it this guy is a smart dudeyou know what this is kim dokja the best mc ever and for novel readers did dokja acted like this in the novel i dont remember clearly but i think he was not that angry i really really want this to get turned into an animei got where hes coming from if he gives those ppl the coins thats equivalent to giving all the clothes off your back in the dead of winter and you die and they still in trouble it benefits for a sec but it didnt truly help i kind of like the route his character is taking a lawfully good character would have been supremely irritating because they would continuously sacrifice themselves without thinking of the personal repercussions just like an avg person hes neutral preservingoh my god im loving this so so much and its getting better every single episodemental note dont ask dokja for anything or i might lose my handshe risked his life to get those coins and what did y’all do just sit around in the station expecting someone else to do the work for youdokja has hit his point i like this character so awesome i like itthese comments literally sound like constellation commentary lol but dokja really is an interesting character because he has a lot to deal with pleasing the constellations trying to stay alive while also helping others it’s really unfair because he has worked really hard for his coins while other people do nothing and just expect the coins to be handed to them gosh this whole comic is amazing sparkleskingsparkles periodtwell that was hot nosebleeds you see nothingif dokja decide to side with that high moral to help those people he will defintely get trapped in cheon inho plan just like if you being kind to the people for one time they will ask you another kindness thats how human do even in the our world and inho want that for his own selfishness and so he can using and controling dokja thats why what dokja do here is right that last panel tho OK_handlight_skin_toneyaaass im so satisfied with his decision not everyone deserves your own kindness just gotta show em what u r truly capable of which enough to dread others and back offlegit wanna hear dokjas voice and the action asfkjfdlflushed_face if this turn out to be an anime speak-no-evil_monkey theres no word can express my mind see this is why i couldn’t survive in an apocalypse i’m too nice the lawful neutral best clift hanger everthis is definitely going to be an anime the way this story is progressing and the twist and turns they’ve made so far and it’s only been chapters yes yes yes i love this scene what comes after is so great honestly so satisfyingbiyungs reactions on the indirect messages is so kawaii he is a antiheromy man went from midoriya to kirito real quick really thinking about buying the fast pass now this is hype afi think i would make the same decision considering the coinsi would ask and i would make decisionsya know what would be really awesome if dokja just killed the leader and took his coins im really liking this series thanks for your hard workdokja has impressed me by showing how smart and calm he iswhat those fools should of known is that everyone has a breaking point and his just got destroyedim glad that dokja isnt gonna put up with this pricks bull anymore it makes me happy to see hes not in a gaming moodremembers how people usually ask for scope the day before an exam and the aducity to ask for stationery the hour before exam me why should ibest character eversparklesthe apocalypse blame gamefinally the snowball plushy mini demon is back not that other bratthe constellation is very impressed with your performance she decides to gift you she also says thank you for replinishing her sanitydokjas squad shouldnt return back to the camp they can just survive on their owndaaanggg someone cover the kid’s ears this is about it get even uglierafter reading the webnovel i can’t begin to tell you how happy i am with this seeing it in picture is one thing now we just need a studio to bring it to lifedokja be likei dont give a fucki love how he doesn’t care if i were him i’d do the same cause why should you care when these ppl are all selfish bustardsdamn how i hate these people in storys who only blame others like that wont help or solve the problem mc has no friggin bussines giving them free coins and then die himself like bruhi did think he would pull out his sword but i did not expect him to cut off the dudes hands jsjsjjsjsjsi feel like the mc is going to become more of an anti hero you know kinda like deadpool but a little more sanedoes anyone know how their names are pronounced especially gilyeongme being a huge fan of rpg’s i’m really interested to see how our little group of characters changes not only emotionally but their skills and items tooi % agree with my mans over here billion iqhmm i’d say he’s a lawful neutral still does good things and follows the law but like he’s really only in it for himself and maybe a few others if he cares about them enough although that’s probably not that likelyok but dokja that was kinda hot ngl see-no-evil_monkeywhat about the business man he got like million or thousand coins from the curse thing didn’t hei love dokja even morebadassi was so interested in this webtoon that after reading the last episode i went ahead and read the webnovel lolwhy the hell he needs to share this is apocalypse he gained his coins slaughtering demons he doesnt need to share it with some man only sitting in the corner safely i would do the same with one exception i would spare kids pov you dont remember the actual main characters name they may think he was acting villain but no hes just being logical and i like itdont worry bro you can open your character status in like chapters i’m so glad dokja didn’t do what other people would deem the “right” thing those people are hypocrites especially that whatshisface he should die firsthuh come on even the lil kid is using his survival skills its high time these people understand dokja way to go boy man i really dislike inho cheon i think dokja is doing the “right” thing we’ll see exactly what he plans next chapter he didn’t take those coins from anyone they willingly paid because they wanted the food he originally collected himself and he brings up a good point that all these people who are alive now most likely killed someone in the first scenario to survive i can’t wait to see how the characters develop especially huiwon also can’t wait to see what fate belongs to inhowho would give out coins to help killers survive like who the hell they think they area lot of top comments are saying everyone there had to kill in the first scenario but like there are clearly young children & older people present maybe they got lucky and had a different scenario bc i dont remember dokja or dokkaebbi saying the first quest was the same for all users but also even if it was the same maybe some of them had similar solutions to dokja in that scenario and the comments are saying its pragmatic to let all those people die i disagree thats eugenics i need coins too face_with_stuck-out_tongue_&_winking_eye to read any furtherlolall this time i thought the dokaebbi eyes were just hollow sockets when in reality he’s got these cutesy bubble eyes loudly_crying_facedamn he really said bye bye to that guys arms i like how different dojka thinks im quite interested to see what he does next i cant deny it that guy was good at manipulating people at the right time he knows when to use his powerful enchanting words that was a nice battoujutsu i like this episodeomg i think i have a crushdokja hello my name is dokja and im chaotic neutral nice to meet youdokja thats dark i like it hehehethe color of his words are as ice cold as he is ryt now lolread the web novel guys it is srsly amazing and you will not regret it i couldnt wait for more of the webtoon so i started the novel and i have been reading it non stop for the past three days coz its so good i keep trying to recommend it but it feels just like when dokja tried to recommend twsa and no one listened to him yk this is a very interesting turn of events eyesaand now we have a psychopath as the thumbnail for a week being kind is good but being a pushover isnt all those ppl would die anyway because they are bad players so dojka would only kill himself for nothing he made the correct decision when the world gets bad enough the good go crazy but the smart they go bad he just stated clearly no to socialism just dokja being dokja at this moment they should know they fcked upthey do realize they are trying to say they deserve coins and then attempt to murder their only chance at survival plus they dont even know killing him will give them back their coinsi need coins too yasss dokja slayss sparklessparklesthat villain is dangerous and cunning he turns everything against you including your actions and wordsgenius kill someone then take your coins back by having to touch fingers where the person transferring coins has to think absolutely brillianti would rather be a villain who does good sometimes than be a heroyass i had to same he very logical character and puts himself first mf went sicko mode skullim not even halfway through this webtoon but i just know this is going to be one of my favouritesif u want your coins back give the food back or did u eat it alreadyconstellation broke reader is satisfied with the amount of head rubs dokja is giving gilyeongcrissy wake up i dont like this grinning_faceright decision dude dokja is not your typical saviour protagonist lolall i could say is slaydokja i love you very much dasurrrvv ahabshsjjdhssudokjas character sparkles🤌light_skin_tonehe kind of look like sung jin wooi’m liking dokja he’s being smart and realistic in this situation yess i like the kind but logical mc hes kind but hes a human he must be kind to himself and the people he care first before random people who just want to leech red_hearthes right he risked his life for those coins and he better not give them to people who just sat there and complained as said before age or gender doesnt matter here u can just upgrade ur stats instead of complaining abt not wanting to diedokja is karma incarnate you reap what you sowthat was a wise decision dokja clapping_handsi am very sick because of the development of the dokja character upside-down_face it making the situation more interesting day by day cowboy_hat_facehe’s being realistic i mean these people are murderers and can’t even pay for the sin the committed dokja went out of his way and earned these coins so why should he give them he would just make lose and what would these people give him backin return nothing he’s not all goodie it’s an apocalypse a fucking apocalypse crazy people skull he wants to survive everyone wants to survive you should be held responsible for you own live they are all moral incorrect inc dokja protag who doesnt care about moral high ground woof woof woof person_bowing‍male_sign️person_bowing‍male_sign️person_bowing‍male_sign️others give me back my coins dokja suck my ass the absolute irony of making the beginning villain a literal edgelord just to pull the same garbage with your main charactereven if he did give them coins they would be monkeys and stay in the station and die the next day anyway _ bruhanyone sharing is caring dokja i dont get paid enough to carethats right show them what kind of people would be like in the future aggressiveness and despirationthese people have the audacity to think that they can kill someone and then beg for their lives like btw has anyone realised that there is another little kid there with his mum r u telling me he killed somebody too dangi would of done the same and i would say that if you arent going to risk it for the biscuit then you are unreliablei love how the kid is just holding his skull weapon so calmly while watching a mans arma get cut offskullwait… i just realized that people would have automatically completed the first round as the body regenerates cells and others die off constantly and a cell is a living organisim rightif these people want to survive so much then they should probably go and do something instead of expecting to leech off of people who go out and earn their survival like dokja doesyes lets go dokjaa i really love his character its a breath of fresh air im so happy dokya isnt the stereotypical goodtwoshoes im so tired of seeing main characters doing things out of guilt and morals especially if theyre not obligated toi mean you want coins but do nothing to help its a tought world you live in you gotta earn the right to livedeath note vibes right nowi love dokja glad hes not a dumb mc actually love his villain side loldokja joey doesnt share food hes a villain a smart one that protects his comradessoo coolllbut not rlly i woulda done smth to return fire on that other evil guyoh and welcome back bihyeong fluffineeesshiit that was so sexy damnthis unlike him~ but this is going to be exciting dokja youre so coolbihyeong~ i miss you ~~yes dokja slice themlove this don’t give in to the majority complainers who did this to themselveschaddokja slayyoh you want your coins back revive every single person you killed in the first scenario and give me back every bit of perfect food i sold to you ^^i dont think hes decision is not really evil if think of it those people are the one who blame him from the start so in short those type of people are just face they only agree with you if they get alot of benefits from it without doing something think about it he work so hard to reach that point while those people are just chilling there waiting for miracle to happen doing nothing and blame other for their own misery oh my goddd i got goosebumps dokja my king hello he is so cool weary_faceweary_faceweary_faceweary_faceweary_faceweary_facei’m freakin so enjoying this twist of personality ughhh i hate constantly seeing unrealistically good morales people bruh in this kinda situation u gotta do everything to survive it’s a two way street if ur gonna help someone hes so coolok not gonna loe they coulda put a finer face on that last panneldokja casually showing off his absolute dumptruck as he slices that man’s arm offwhy does the last slides remind me of ninang bryan from tiktokface_with_tears_of_joywait i just want to make sure that her god person thingy is theseus or theaus i forgot but i remember playing a game and it was labrynthy and it said something about the string the thsues guy used to navigate the doungeoun but im pretty sure were thinking thinking_face rightactually i agree with him i would probably be the villain so to say if i was to a survival world like this also hes not completly selfish he did share things with his companions and gave them a very good discount too all in all hes just trying to survive and the people in there all have killed someone to survive while he hasnt so in the end the way he does things to me is pretty justifiedomfg finally a character who doesnt have hero saving syndrome hero saving syndrome is something i created it basically means the mc tries to save everyone even when its clearly dangerousyes use the dagger i wanna see what it does smiling_face_with_hornssmiling_face_with_hornsif i had to guess dokjas moral alignment if guess that hes either chaotic neutral or neutral evilfinally but i do hope atleast the children can be savedomg dokjas new sword why is bihyeong so cute i want to hug him so badif i was in dokjas position i would have given them help immediately but probably would regret it later on because people are fickle minded they can demand for your help and forget what you did for them and turn on you later on he became that nerd into badass real quickhe actually did the right thing its good he said no coins arent cheap they should of worked hard to earn some they had all day lazy people wanting handoutshes just like meevery bitch in this platform other then dokja group survived by killing someone and now they are begging for there lifeohh schnapp eyeseyeseyesgoatjany goati love himthats what i would have done if i was himbro this guy so badass it’s hotloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_face no homoifw dokja being such a dynamic mcdokja omg ily hes so fineget disarmed squatsman this is awesome i love a good antiherojesus loves you finally yes my insides are melting this is a top tier protagonist right here not like some cliche saint wannabe masochistic protagonist like in every other web novelmangahes so handsome constellation dark flame phoenix smiles at dokjas sudden change in personality and cruel wayshe made a good move literally half of the people there were bad people anyways they deserved itthe way dojka cut the persons arm was the coolest thing ever i have seen all weekshit escalated realquickhell yeahhh texting with the host snapping this is amazingdespite most people thinking that secretive plotter is the author im gonna guess its dokja himself or at least a different version of him my reasoning the fact that the secretive plotter recommended a scenario and that dokja has said that he has recommended twsa to others is the reasoning weak yes but its there and weak enough for it to be a well crafted twist in my opinioni’m absolutely in love with this story shame on me for not finding this earlieri dont care how cruel i might sound right now but just kill them all already i cant stand this anymorei really cant hate bihyung if hes this cutemoral high ground umm excuse me but this is the apocalypse yes tell them dokja weary_facehonestly id be so fed up i wouldve snapped a lot earlier than dokja didas he should beat they asses dokja this is why everyone likes dokjaalthough tonka is acting a little evil he probably is trying to do this to somehow reason to the people and break hans incite skill and probably earn a incite skill himself furthermore he might himself ask the people to collectively kill hans and his henchmen which will make the people earn the required coins go kinghyeonsyeong is a big man child and i’m here for itagain hes so hotdokja is a really interesting character ambiguous gray characters are my favorite if portrayed correctly its their fault too hahai love dokja he’s not one of those “good guys” but he’s more interesting love an unhinged character more of him plsi love how dokja is keeping a balance between the ryt sense of morality and the manipulative aspects of the situation while on one end he is keeping his promise to get food and is doing as much as he can to keep the ones in charge from doing anything bad he isnt tolerating any kind of manipulation and taking his stand we stan loudly_crying_faceraising_handsyaasssjhdhhdhhdhdhdshshvnndndndnhf so satisfying im curious in the raw is gilyeong call dokja only by his name or he call dokja by hyung dokjaa my duudeegod damn dokja is cold blooded kissing_facevictory_hand️ beat their as smiling_face_with_hornssmiling_face_with_hornsfolded_handssmiling_face_with_hornssmiling_face_with_hornssmiling_face_with_hornsogreface_blowing_a_kissi love his character so much more nowconstellations smiledok smiles evilyme both but with laughterdokja do be having a cute butt doeand if i refuse on a tshirtchillshyeonseong cutiei like that it seems like dokja is becoming more like yu the longer the story goes ondream be like sharing is caring and i dont caredokja is maintaining the high moral ground as he said the first scenario was the original sin they all murdered someone to survive but have since been living on handouts failing to take responsibilities for their own lives after taking someone elses in his eyes they arent good people and have proven time and time again to be scummy or pathetic on top of being murders besides coins doesnt seem that hard to make with these mood constellations rolling_on_the_floor_laughing hell yes you dont owe these people anything they have the gull to take a life but not the balls to survive by their own accord i think he should just drop it all on han and let him use those coins he just goti love that dokja isnt the golden child and is morally gray like so happy for it its so much more realistic i really like this dude he is giving me serious life lessons atmyou need to make an anime out of this i havent got this worked up over a story in a whilepfft at least dokji and i have the same though it’s their fault for being so dependable they should also hunt their own foodsif i were him i’ll be like “i need to take care of myself for today tomorrow and so on” called me selfish if you want but it’s survival instinct why did i smile when dokja slice that man armskullslayy them alll hun esp tht bastard incho whtever tht iswelp time to kill them allface_without_mouthhe do be kinda scarycutie bihyeong is backkthe constellation of me is satisfied with your doingsmiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_closed_eyessmiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_closed_eyesmy guess is he’ll help ppl who help him and leave ppl behind who wrong him but who knows idfk im getting major bi himbo vibes from hyunsung since the beginning yeah glad he finally snappedoh man i missed bihyeong like he’s so adorable i really appreciate the constellations comments lolso no ones gonna talk about how the giant insect beat the stone rhino in a fightok lets be reali mean why would he give the coins he earnedeven if he give how long they are gonna survive day day and to how many of them he can givethe only thing they will try to do is suck him until his coins get finished ofc becoz he looks easy among ones with high coinsinho or they may even kill himand then go to another thats how it workswhat a badasswonder what the constellations thought of that stop using your money on coins ii didi just think it’s funny and creative how they incorporated the constellations reaction to different situationsi dont know how the angel will react thoughhe attac backthe constellation the sleepy chaos is too lazy to interactcheon inho keeps getting on my nervesbro they didn’t risk their lives to stay alive why should he share with lazy cowardsi know this guy is tired i feel bad for all of them i mean probably all those people killed or let someone died in order to survive yes the good thing to do would be to share but why should he really i do think that moral is an important thing and kindness is a great value to have but you cant force other people to be kind nor righteous specially in a world like that and especially when theyll most surely turn their backs on him once he stop been useful i dont like many of his decisions but i understand themis it just me or is bihyeong looking more like the demonic child of monokuma and pikachuto be honest people probably thought there wouldnt be a survival fee so they mightve bought food with the rest of those coins so in a way he is kind of responsible for their deathyeah bihyoeong is back i thought they removed him bachade he made the contract but i guess not nice though hed be really cute if he wasnt such a sadistah a fellow antihero i see i really wanna find out who is the secretive plot constellation ook like um naofumi was like this the stupid princess lied got him in trouble and he became a good bad guy just like dokjakinda wish we could see his total coin count would k really break the banknoo don’t lose your mindhah plopbeautifuloooh that hurt woah dokja hejehehwbnehd so coolloudly_crying_facefood horder is pleased by dokjas actionsi mean he’s not wrong but he’s also not rightitd be funny if he sold out mr suit for his k coinsi jus noticed this but the art style is similar to unholy bloodthe entitlement really jumped outhyeonseong lee looks a bit like our voltron space dadabsolutely no onedokja the concept of what we know as what is good and what is bad left this world when this game started damn perfect response reminds me of those beggers in assassins creedthe way i smack my leg from that scene can be heard all the way to the next villagefr you wanted to live you cant take care of your selfthat old man is uselessinteresting 🤩 i really want this to be a book so i can keep with me and i can recommend to others oh get over yourselffinally a realistic character me why would i give my coins to you too i just find it funny that the sound effect for dokja cutting of that mans hand is ploploudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_facei dont know why but i like the main character always teaching the person in wrong a lessonoop if he lost his finger did he loose his money xdoh he’s somewhat of an evil character evil in the way that he causes grief to those who care about himdokja i love youyay bihyeong is backi love how dokjas a morally grey character i completely agree with everything he did it makes sense cuz hes not obligated to anyone and he is kinda helpful to some people so yeahomniscient reader huge chicken legsits finger lickin goodi mean dokjas right theyre the ones who survived because they killed people and now they blame dokja for them not being able to survive because of the lack of coins so pathetic and what a hypocritedude was like no thanks hes backdamn dokja yes kinggg relieved_facehave i ever said how much i do love dokja confounded_facered_heart ahh and the story is barley beginning gosh damn someone pass me some chicken wings this is getting goodwould dokja count as a morally grey character thinking_faceoh finally this is what ive been looking for to an mcwell it is true if you can not survive on your own in that kind of world why would you still wanna live eyesshart getting realomg smilethose ppl deserve this they already commited sin in the first scenerio and now they r blaming dokja for this situation heck yea dokja made the ryt decisionwhy is everything going so smoothly people give the coins dokja why people kill that bastd dokja big mistake slash people sht readers yessthat was unexpected i thought dokja would defer the crowd to that han guy who has coinsi wonder where this will gohyeonseong lee has begun too simp on you face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyif he has the most coins that means he has the most fighting experience some people should know that instead they should bargain with himthere are people like them everywhere manipulated by others and just live following the flow they dont have any passion to pursue and go with the majority even i am like that sometimes this just gave me a smack on my head watch out junghyeok yu theres a new protagonist in townyaaasss dokja yaasswow dokja is really cool but why didn’t he throw that guy who killed him under the buson that last panel dojka got birthday_cakebirthday_cakebirthday_cakehahaha i like this f@ckng reader this type of character is what i want to see may the f@ckng creator make more characters like this hahaha f@ck you guys btwas marcus always says no refundsthis is true shit bro why you gotta be helpful and all that stuff selfishness is human nature but they bought the food with their coins earlier then they want a refund smham i sensing light yagami vibes right nowgive his food back if they want their coins i like dokjas neutral personlityeeeki felt bad for them up until he pointed out that they had to kill someone to get this far ok ok okaay be a bad bitch fine by mewhy do i remember shen qingqiu with the blue thingy heck yeshyeonseong lee is adorable with the way his eyes are sparkling

time smiling_face_with_hornssmiling_face_with_hornssmiling_face_with_hornssmiling_face_with_hornssmiling_face_with_hornssmiling_face_with_hornsdamn dokja i got chillsthis is great for a moment there i thought i was reading solo leveling this webtoon is so good it reminds so much of solo leveling and i like how they dint copy solo leveling and made it their own thing every week i have to wait for a new chapter for solo leveling but now to wait i can read this this is probably my second favorite webtoon behind solo leveling i love this bookdokjas development is impressive his judgment based on logic and reasoning and him not letting anyone wear him down or manipulate himits a leader quality clapping_hands his eyes went from innocent at the start of the series to downright badass nownow he pulled it out and slammed it on the tabledokja is a true capitalistholy fricking moly i love this webtoon who else read the web novel im up to ch now smiling_face_with_sunglasses btw im bragging %did sangah notice what dokja was doing when he was trying to see her personal attribute im afraid of what will happen to his group now so far they have all trusted him because he has helped them out to some degree but after he cut off that guys arms and isnt helping anyone then maybe they will go against him too if they did how would that change things and how come he didnt out the other guy didnt he get a bunch of coins after taking the last blow of the monster dokja beatremember the name roecleanconstellation galiate is speechlessi want some of his wits also his ability to read the room and say no impresses me to an extreme levelthis manga is exactly my type sad thing is i cant buy coins cuz im broke cliffhangers are illegaldepending on others is not a bad thing but if they tell you to depend on them otherwise that would be cruel to them pensive_faceshits going down mananyone else thought dokja is doing hood rnthe constellation fangirl shipper is pleased with this developmentpeople giving all they got just to live another day hes a reader its understandablethe moment dokja drew his sword i heard megalovania begin to playdude that last scene was sooo bad asome people bout to get torn upi feel like hes a little too prepared for this world that right now hes not fully accepting what around him is real hes just doing what hed dream of doing for years while reading the story i think theres going to be a moment where he really reflects on his actions and maybe breaks down ngl sangah gave away her attribute and sponsor with this but since it’s major spoilers i’ll refrain from saying anything wait bihyung was the one responsible for the item box jeez i’m on chapter and that’s still new info aww they’re all so happy and now they’re not i gotta say inho was clever but dokja was just two steps ahead heythe cursed guy got k coinsso once they realize that he’ll be chased by the others xdlol dokja’s not just gonna give these people welfare they don’t deserve itwhat about the deamon killer with k coins wheres he at throw that btch under the buslook at the flick of that wristskullhe looks so psychotic in that last panel i love this character so fking muchyeah if it were me id be a clear looks like you fellas are gonna die today siigh i wish i werent broke then i could read the next seven episodesim so proud a main character with some gutsdokja i love you i deada died when he said that face_with_tears_of_joyi wonder how will be the character development of dokja hmm me when my sister tries to take my food her gimme summ me why should i what really shocks me about this story is how no one out of the main group has said anything about their family members its so sad to be taken away from everyone you love so fast gosh thats why i really really like this webtoon wooh plot twistimmaculatemans grew moon ballsthat guy i dont have enough coins to give coins to all this poor peopleme if i was dokja bitch do i look as if i caredidn’t what’s his face sell them food toome reading all the episodes times wiating for the next oneplop plop the dudes arm got chopped choppedi love dokja’s character he’s not going to be the main character that always wants to do the right thing even when it could cost him his life he’s more logical and i think that’s gonna make the story a lot more interestingthe next week well see a lot of blood and i cant waitthing is he still kinda is maintaining the moral high ground who knows what these people did in the initial scenario on top of many already having shown to be straight up bad guys particularly those led by the gang leader dude so not only is it not a stretch to assume these people arent as innocent as they seem but its also very likely that they werent lucky and killed some bugs like dokjas group did which considering what dokjas thoughts have been this is exactly what hes thinkingthe man snapped lmaogod dayum double cheeked up weary_faceflushed_facedokja showing them what’s upbesides that guys hands hes so hotjust walk to him poke poke poke with that iron thingy and coins rewarded from the neet godthat was one hell of a turnthe way my voice cracked when i screamed hell yedokja made it clear that hes not messing around why would anyone take him as a push overoh theres gonna be one for female character and she go be a badass this is so good i loving this so farsmiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_smiling_eyescan’t wait to see what happens nextit’s the apocalypse bishesrolling_on_the_floor_laughing something had to snap eventually he was petering on the edge of this from day onei have to wait days for the free episodenooo i neeed moreit would be cool if dokja ends up being the antagonist and the protagonist remains the same he did say the regressor lost his humanity after regressing times maybe dokja will lose his over time given how strong he is itll be interesting to see how characters like sangah can beat his fourth wall ability especially since he has no character profile on her it is possible to beat dokja since gilyeong already has an idea of what dokja is capable ofif im remembering this correctly isnt the cost of a human life coins so if he killed half of them probably the ones trying to kill him then he could save the other halfi feel like dokjas alignment would be neutral because he seems to fit into a morrelly grey area seeing as he isnt evil but then he also isnt good either its really cool to see characters such as dokja who dont stick to morals but still arnt evil i’m in love with this webtoonhe got you the food twice you

stand up to the republicans that stronglydokja is true neutral maybe even evil neutral definitely not any gooddokja is a dope mc tlike bish if you wanted to survive should have gotten the other

smiling_face_with_open_mouthsmiling_face_with_open_mouthyes dokja slay kinglmao i would’ve asked them for a scholarship essay relieved_face earn your share bishhthat scene right there reminded me of light and lyesssfinally the killer instinctactually i dont know if i would have been capable to refuse helping others but i love how he responded to them i am totally in love with this comic and i wanted to ask if you have a book in the making or possibly making this into a anime series i will buy all of them as soon as they come out this is the best comic i’ve read in so long and you literally have me hanging on a thread can’t wait to read some more your loyal readerdokja is not one to stick to being the gold coin of the people and that is great because it is proof that u owe nothing to no one and u are not entitled to them and honestly i wouldnt share coins either if i were in the place of dokja cuz he worked hard and killed beasts to earn those coins and they think just by threatening him they will get coins hell naw get off ur asses and go do something useful for once lmaoodayum the art looks so much like solo leveling im sooo excited yheeits so good to see something different fuck heroism life is hard and heartlessgive me some coins i wanna read what happens next otlhaha dokja is pissedlets goooaahhh i love this mc he’s not like tho’s mc who will always choose to do the “good” things this is getting to be more interesting and i love itoh damn dont get any closer or you gonna look like a trex with short armsholy shii nuggeysgangstaoh my gosh yes i’ve been searching

dokja to give the coins for which he sacrificed many things🧐🧐ohh i love his crazy eyes still those poor peopleugh that was so sexy of dokjathe constellation asks for five coinsdokja im your proud and loud simp did he really think dokja would just let them kill himnooo i want to read moree sobsyess slice themaye rambo kill them all an donedokja is so cooli would’ve said that cursed jerk off has thousands of coins he is pissedomg i missed bihyeong soo much ^^ kissing_face_with_closed_eyeskissing_face_with_closed_eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyes glad that hes back yall being like the moral high ground um bro it’s even the moral high ground to give them coins i wouldn’t say that decision is morally not good at all obviously it’s isn’t the bad thing but like jdjeh yeits true it does look pathetic to blame dokja like its their fault for not go hunting for the mf coins dokja is such a cool character i love characters like himglad the survival fee only exists in the story otherwise i’d be dead right now smiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_cold_sweatface_with_tears_of_joy i have zero coins on webtoon & it’s right nowfuckemim here just hoping that gilyeong and others in the group wont get scared or distrustful of dokja because of this or telling him that he should help them those people dont deserve it and dokja is % right with taking that approach even if he helped them theyd never pay backi really love this webtoon so freaking satisfying omg im in lovesmiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyesunlike other male leads his plots are different and alot more intresting neither op nor weakwell a man tries to murder you to survive at the orders of a coward so you make an example out of him perfectly reasonable in the apocalypseyes that badass moment im waiting for he trynna survive the apocalypse okayno time for begging noobs just get good smhsuper coolfreak school ami right fellasyess yess take my moneyyou don’t always have to be kindariadnes thread sjsndbdis he going to go full lelouchwow i dont agree how he handled the situations but then again when the other guy is like that the rest wont listen to what he wants to say but this is so amazing tt_tto kawaii koto“dokja is not like that” she saidgirl don’t do it dokjadokja be like oh please just shut updokja adios “amigos”took dudes arms ok that was hot 🥵🥴face_with_thermometerface_with_thermometerface_with_thermometerface_with_thermometerwell its true that everyone there had to kill someone or something to even get that far and they have nothing to offer him still i hope he doesnt go full edgelordi like how dokja chose a nonethical way the next chapters are going to be glowing_starimmaculateglowing_staro holy mother of god this made him x hotter 🥵thats my baby loving how closely this follows the novel glad to be able to see the characters ive only read about drawn out and coming to life this toon makes my wednesdays betterwe love seeing morally grey characters man give me someone i can really relate too wait didn’t the other guy who got cursed have the most coins everyones gangsta until dokja shows upnext week needs to be here tmmrloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceit’s the apocalypse at a certain point it’s everyone for themselves person_shrugging‍female_sign️just a reminder to all the people who want him to share because its the right thing to do all of these people begging for coins are murderers and its not like hes obligated to help them either just because he is the main charactermy man dojka is going for that chaotic neutralevil routesavage dokja i admit it i am bored of all good and soft main leads i want something worth and here comes dokja the savage king actually in real life everyone is selfishblood for the blood godeveryones coming up with big brain comments and im here like lol dokjas hoti love this sword it makes me feel like im welding a idk justsomething good ya knowdaamn that was sickkill them alli hadnt thought of the first scenario like that they all killed someone else to be here and thus nullifies any reason to even attempt for a moral high ground most of dokjas group killed insects and remains for the time being non murderers very interestingits easy to say this cause its a fictional story but not everyone was gonna survive anyway why not just get rid of the pricks and assholes like thisthe decision he take might be seem wrong but tbh if i was at his place i would do the same thing i guessyeah cut their asses thats mah boyi would have had them compete for the coins like top five get a loan for the survival fee and maybe i’ll let them join me or fight for me later to pay it back their debt pahahahahaha i love psycho dokja hahahahahais there no one mention about how gilyoungee calling dokja in the novel he call dokja hyung since he is younger than dokja maybe its better to change how gilyoungee call dokja in the next episodethey fucked up they fxcked up they fxcked up my mans went off not like they can cancel himi like the scans translation of the last scene more it was more epic and cool which got me excited for the next chapters this mess youre all in do you really think its my fault goosebumps all over my body after that linefinally im sick of these people who just wait for help and do nothing that inho cheon too his character is disgusting people like him never admit their mistakes and push the blame onto others all the time while making it seem that theyre a saint despicable i agree with dokja those people are being pretty selfish even though they want to survive they cant be aggressive and start asking for a refund of what they already ate sotoo late people skullooh its starting to get interesting teehee smiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_closed_eyessmiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_closed_eyesaye yoi screamed out loud when he cut his arms off he’s serious imagine you attack someone and they whip out a sword and chops your hands off ah a normal dayyes suddenly the apocalypse is turning into a double apocalypse he can’t give all these people coins everyday just to survive dokja has no real obligation to these people they never saved his life he only profited off of them and the only people he really has ties to is the people in his party so i stand by his decisionbihyeong is backloudly_crying_facered_heart️oofhe does have a point everyone there is likely a murder and the people who tell him to be a good person are the worst ones well they are the one who demand food and now they are putting the blame on dokjawow such a pathetic humansconfused_facei want to see the thug leadee diesmirking_facei want to see the thug leadee diesmirking_facehe gonna kill that blonde and when he does i’ll be laughingwell he did nothing wrong everyone who managed to make it here killed somebody but did not have the guts to carryon and earn their living so no one has any obligation to meet their demands if he lets them survive now by giving in they will only die next round because they are incapable of surviving on their own thats a wasted investment okay that went from to real quicki highly doubt dokja is gonna let the random kids die if he does then the support of his allies goes down the gutter and most the constellations gonna hate himi love this series the constellation dania twilight is laughing her teeth off due to the evil face of the incarnation dokja kim the constellation dania twilight is too broke to gift you coins coins please i just need coins to buy the next episodeugh i love main characters like this bc the plot is so interestingdokja i getchu bud thats the exact reason why i dont like to play a hero every person will ask u about ur morals i have read this novel til the end just incase you know survival of the fittest bitchesdokja looks more handsome when hes being mean are interested to see your moves to me dokja seems like a good guy but instead of giving handouts he’s teaching others to be responsible for their actions and in his own ways helps his friends enjoy this type of kim dokja while you still can this man is going to throw handsboi this world is twisted now and days so survival is the way to go not that i percent agree with dokja but still i love the twistsy e swhere did those huge drumsticks go 🥺we get dokja is a badass and the other people are idiots but is no one going to talk about hyeonseong lee and his sheild its so sparklyhehe im excited to see everything illustrated i recently picked up the novel and am on chapter things haven gotten extremely interesting i recommend giving the novel a try if you ever have spare time ^^badassthis is funholy shitscary but real fing cooldamm hes neutral i dont know why people mad he cant look after others with no disregard to his own life in my opinion people should never be blamed for doing what they need to do to survivei love dokjas character aint like some typical protagonist with golden heartthis is a prime example of a good protagonistyeah bitches stop free loadingtheres a lady with a little boy i hope he does share some coins with them though vg is fascinated by your story and is waiting for new episodes he have no coins vis it me or dokjas really hot with that swordjust like the people in this current chapter i need coinslove it novel plot is really good and now the drawings i dont deserve this one bitcharacters like dokja are my favorite everyone its his faultdokja lemme tell you somethinlemme tell you somethinremeber communism works in theory but when put into practice it fails horribly everyone at the shelter should know thatuno reversed that green shirts threatooh~ dokja is so tenseyes boy ask for some respect if i may her skill reminds me of hisokas bungee gumskullunbroken faith in action looks absolutely stunninghe is taking a very interesting route had it been me i would have also refused to disclose little to any information as well fearing that it would cost my life however im kind of concerned to his development as an individual because in the beginning he was shy and seemed nice enough now he has become nearly similar to the regressor and its quite hard to hd anything against him when any other person in his shoes wouldve done the same bihyeong i missed yougreat chapter dokjas character is super interesting im very excited to see how this scenario endsbut i’m just a kidloudly_crying_faceif i was grown and had lots of mobey i would turn this into animedokja is soo cooli rate it lowkey the big ego dudes fault cause he built a community that became like thati know that the crowd of people are heavy hypocrites but i really cant blame them theyre just trying to survive by buying food and asking for help from people who can help them its just a survival instinct and also imagine if you were in that situation you dont have powerful friends maybe youre not very good you dont have a good constellation and youre broke most importantly youre not the main characterprotagonist in the story at all so you have to live its just pitifuli love it this character us going closer to the chaotic neutral side but sticks firmly in true neutral this way in terms of dnd allinment checks he could instantly alter his actions to output a spicific looking outcome like he looks true chaotic evil then maybe if your pushing it episodes later he is neutralhe need to get to the alignment slowly and slowly he looks like the ideal lawful good protagonist instead he is a neutral character who is on for the ridecant wait for kim dokja whipping those bastard assesomg getting these updates is always one of the highlights of my studyfilled week im really interested to see how dokja turns out i love the direction its going in right nowyeess we love a morally grey characterjudgment time kim dokja is awesome xdonline schoolhome work can wait the childs life is more important must proteccraised_fistred_heartgod i love it when character don’t take any shît relieved_face dokja is an ultimate savage loli just wanna binge thislook at those happy blushing face lee hyunseong is such a dorklets go dokja whooprotecc bby gilyeong my bby leemans speakin the teuth they all killed on the first round and everything they did up til then was their choice so they cant really blame amyone but themselvesdokja has a point here while he obviously wants to help he doesnt owe these people anything if they failed the test they failed the test he doesnt have to sacrifice his life for the sake of somebody elsepeople erase my foolish decisions and give me coins again so i dont suffer my own consequences dokja no red_heart️smiling_face️dagger️dagger️cant he just finish the scenario and save everyone from payingdokja is added to the list of dark haired mcs i simp for thank you creator for my birthday giftsleepy_facered_heartim i the only one that finds the cotton ball thing cute“oh his arm got cut off huh”dokja you lit flexed_bicepshe didnt have does kinds of morals he just didnt want to stand out but was forced to do so by a jackass with the power to manipulate the masses i’d kill someone for more coins to read ahead in this webtoon neutral_facei really want this to be turned into an anime it would be so good viva la revolutionbut it kinda made sense all those people survived because they killed someone and now that they can’t even manage to survive on their ownyou prick that t man is soo pathetic i cant stand ityou know what i like about dokja hes not like your usual mc who wants to save everyone who doesnt want anyone to die who wants to be the hero hes not really sympathetic and he sees things as they are eg these people were shit to me before so why should i help them do they deserve my help he wants to do whats best for him just like they all do except that hes not leaching off of others hes doing it himself i really respect him as a character for thatsome of you will die but that is a sacrifice i’m willing to make he looked like a badass at the end just like a villain and i absolutely love itsparkling_hearti am so hyped for next episoderealistically speaking most of these people are going to die anyway maybe not today or even tomorrow but they wont last with the monsters as a whole most people are weak they look for easy ways out and for others to do for them giving the money back or paying their way for more day only prolongs the inevitable and leaves you with even more people begging tomorrow this decision had to be made sooner or later this series is so amazing i’m so excited every tuesday after a hard day at work to read thiscounter offer nodokja you bastard that was too badassu go dokja i missed you dokkaebi if that was the spelling loldang dokja is ice coldinsert evil giggle if words dont work they bout to talk to these sparkleshandssparkleswhat a badass protagonistwill i get killed if i say yesquestion for people who read the manhwa gilyounges stance in the last panel shows he is ready to throw hands for his new father figurehell yeah no stupid goodytwoshoes here babyhe could of shifted it to the rich annoying guy i dint remember the name of whi kill stealed to get k coinsdokja did the right thing you can’t blame some one for everything game is game i get excited when he cut off that mrons hand cant wait ∆ decision]he looks so badasssmiling_cat_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_cat_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_cat_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_cat_face_with_heart-eyesomg slayythat one guy who has over coins be like $$$see this is what im saying omniscience has a cost and that cost is that every interaction you have down to the smallest level is an equation you just need to solve for the best possible outcome and it doesnt matter what that takes or gains because its deffinitionally best its basically blue orange moralitytbh i dont like the heartlessness but at the same time i know damn well id do the same thing honestly its hard to judge this situation bc he doesnt know if everyone there actually killed someonesome couldve had the same idea with the bugs but at the same time its most likely they didi love his character right nowhyeonseong omgconfounded_faceconfounded_facesparkling_heartthe leader of the major group is so manipulative i dont think any of the about to die characters tried it but if they had some coins left just not enough for the survival fee i might have been tempted to negociate with dokja to an exchange in order to die with a full belly like the last smoke but instead a last steaki know they probably have to do that but i laugh every time i see the notice of depictions of violence like you should have written that into the manga description its in almost every chaptersmiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_cold_sweatgod damncrossed_fingerscrossed_fingersblushin like a maniac rn 🤭🤭what kind of dummy rushes someone with a sword personally… who even cares bout these people they’re bloodthirsty as soon as things turn sour and they can’t see that the obviously evil leader is in the wrong here unamused_faceedit and if you want to survive in an apocalypse situation like this you have to figure out a way to survive being a mindless background groupthinker is a surefire way to die ingenuity is the way to goha people with no moral tryna be moral loli really like how dokja doesnt try to compromise with everything in his way pretty refreshing tbhi think this would happen when something like this happen those people should start taking responsibility for their own after killing people from st round damnn that was so damn good so satisfying weary_faceweary_faceyes dokja slay slay those bitchesyes good choice dokjaslay dokjai really like the constellations they seem extremely cool especially the prisonerim happy he did that hyeonseongs reaction to the shield is pricelessahhh this feels so much better im tired of those characters who try to stay at societys standards you go dokjayay morally grey characters are my favoriteyeah kindai love that he is not niceamazing story and art please support the authortranslatori agree with dokja theyre in a position where they have it make an effort to survive and its the law of the chain strong and weak ones and he doesnt have to share his coins that he collect with his and team effort also you share once and theyll keep coming all the time cause they want the easy wayso agree totally with dokja hes not wrong or baddeserve so muchyesss ugh that was satisfyingslice oh your arm hit my blade congrats youve lost a couple of pounds loseryou seem confused you dont have power over him because he cant kill every single one of you you had power over him because he didnt want to that white thing are cute lol yet scaryso should i just ignore that there was no comments for the past few chapterswhats so bad becoming a villainoh yeah things are starting to get interestingbihyeong is taking me out loudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_facedokjas character is interesting than most protagonists ive ever seenwait hold on arent we the readers the constellations in this casehe unlocked the rinnesharingan thats all i gotta sayhan myungoh had around thoque delicia finalmente um enche linguiça dessa apanhando morality doesn’t even exist in this world anymore it all depends on the person’s values and dokja’s got pretty unpredictable values im sure he cares about the people he considers his team now and he even saved huiwon without expecting to gain anything in return which is odd cause he’s been doing things for his own benefit he also lied to gilyeong so he’d still have some hopeoptimismgod im loving dokjaman i love this but it makes sense since his whole thing is like im not the protagonist so why should i be a herogileyeong has a power to communicate with animals how cooolhe is so🤌light_skin_tonethe constellation loves the mche should at least give the coins back to the people that bought food he knew they would charge coins to live and took advantage not cooli like it dokja kim sharing is caring my ass idk but i like dokjaright decisionno hesitation i like ityeeess go tell em bruhhyou know i feel sorry for the small children unless their parents held someonesomething down and mental scarred by having them kill the children died dokja makes jin woo look like a saint lmaohe is starting to look slowly but surely like sung jinwoomorally gray characters like erenaotare really interesting for me its great to have new types of characters from time to timebihyeong

becoming cooler by every episode zjhajaim like dokja and he did great in this survival game only care about yourself and the people you actually care about your comrades you dont need other peoples

pity and kindness to random peopledo you really blame me for this situationi got chills from this fr i alreadyknow this whole webtoon finna be goodgoddamn dokja finally a protagonist thats an

goodsmiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyesthe people sharing is caring dokja no its communismat first i disagree with dokjas actions but in second thought i realized he was really just fending for himself while it seemed like dokja swindled coins from the crowd knowing that the food he sold would vanish anyway and thus decreasing their chances of survival he only did it because the pressure was placed unto him plus he really didnt anticipate that survival fee so the incited mob were just reaping the consequences of their gullibility in letting themselves be manipulatedthe constellation ybahmedd laughs at the despair of those who tried to kill dokjayasssi genuinely love the fact that dokja is an antihero heyy our favorite fluffy pokemon is back oh my goshh hes so cool i love himmdamniminluvsmiling_face_with_heart-eyesre leerlo es asombroso como siempre a main character who’s merciless huh new to me but i’m looking forward to this edit if this ever happened in real life i would’ve done the same thing nglim not hating in the least but i love the influence solo leveling had in breaking more mcs away from the traditional build dokja is

really awesome byebye armsomg omgdokja is developing moral is a creation of the previous world in this world moral dont existoh damn o he got unarmed omgkirito ngh dokjaam i the only one who thinks hes hot🥵i love dokja’s character smoh god hes so hothdjdjfwhjsthcdamnlike you should only get help if you deserve that if not dont make moral excuse rightwhy there is no music im literally being so loud right now just rooting for himanti heroi just hope the others dont lose trust in him for this because hes not even in the wrong tbhbro why tf is he built like the mc from tomb raider king all the characters have a really big similaritytjats my boynice dokjatbh im agree with dokja rolling_on_the_floor_laughingdokja is my unbothered king idk i think he is weeding out the evil people to help the good ones i think morally he does have the high ground on thisi am so curious at to the type of person dokja ishe isn’t a hero and not a villian eitherwell i meannn itll just be a nuisance if this type of people actually surviveskraaazythese people knew what was coming and if they have other people like kids or elderly to pay for as well hold off on food for a day if needed do something anything to get them that doesnt involve waiting til the last minute and going mental on this guy that worked hard for his im so glad he didnt back down or cave in to this worthless leaders gamesplop went his handgooddd my manpeople really get crazy when they are about to die why did they come back aywaysyes yes its starting to be interesting i love dokjathese idiots why did i laugh tho whats wrong with mewhy should he give them his coins they are just going to die soon i doubt they’ll even make it the next payment point that’s a complete waste that’s not being a villain that’s just being smart do what you have to to survive i love how our mc is moral or immoral depending on the situation its refreshing that hes not % moral or % immoral dokja is really out here explaining the theme “sharing is not caring”the goon squad was so ready to attack pathetic scum he aint rich for nothing face_with_tears_of_joydokja worked very hard to get the coins and the weapons he worked very hard to level up to survive so what right do those people who have done nothing but living on other people’s efforts just like a parasites have to ask him to give them coinshes just surviving with a reason guys no need to be so poopy i completely agree with this decision because as shitty as it is this is the reality of this world and he knows that things cant go back to normal and if theres a wish that can then if they die at this point it wont matter so rather increase his chances as much as possible right now and keep as many coins to himself as possible because if they have to depend on him to get coins they wont survive in the future eitheryes finally hes not dumb and trying to act like a hero like other mc in every storyiesamen to that you made your bed so lie in itunamused_facewowdokkaebi looking cute rnone pair of hand is gone pair moreyou are special you are loved black swordsman oo this mans looks like nothing but a main character bruhspoiler warning please dont read this comment if you arent far enough how does this not count towards him not having ever killed anyonedamnnn i wonder what the others are gonna think of him nowsige lang dokja maging demonyo kapa hahahahah noicei wonder how many coins dokja have nowhow come the mr han is still alive what was the curse imposed on himabahhahahahahha bihyeok’s wink was cutei really want sokka at some point to pick secretive plotter since they seem to have the same mischievous actionstime to put that op sword to a good useaccording to what he said i believe that he doesnt want to share something worthy with murderersdokja aku padamu loudly_crying_face he reminds me of the anime darwin game damn that was a really good anime for mei love it i love it i love every single episode of this story 🤍🤍🤍🤍situation aaahh periodt hands sikee one last chapter i swear i’m gonna sleepmahak na ata kita dokja aa wjshsbsjsisjjsjsjsyeah dokja rat bastard my beloved secretive plotter is such a bro well well i would have made first attack if i was mci brought the food you eat it and now talk about refundgah daymndokja is a slytherin for surehonestly i would just lie and said id spent all my coins on the sweet new sword sorry not sorrycool theres no mercy for dishonest gangsters give us back our coins give me back my foodhonestly the people got that far by killing at the very least they could try to complete the scenarios although people in crisis rarely think rationally especially with that shit startertiny bihyeong ʕ•ᴥ•ʔhis legs were cut off his arms were cut offi would stand in line for thisthere’s always room in life for thisoo shwapfuc tht these ppl hav no shame just latchin on him for free everytimepove how the psycho faces are drawngo off dokjacommunismayy pop off you bastard and i oophell yeah boiii fuckouttahere with that weakass shitthats right kill them allmario yesbruuhhe didnt do anything wrongwhy do ppl blame himits not his fault all their food got abductedwhat was the scenario again wouldn’t they get out of paying if they just completed iti better not see one constellation complainy e a h d o k j a the anti hero yesshehehehe gold diggersthis is so excitingthats how you play with these mfspls kid dont think bad about him you are sharp you know that is not his fult rightinsanity its kinda like letting a murder off his or hers sentence you wouldnt do that so why would he have to help them when they have nothing useful for him agree with his pov can somebody clarify if the completion of scenarios accects every member of the group or just who is fulfilling the requirementsi would’ve have said “what do i get for” or “prove your worth” because these guys are just desperate anywayi would have paid them off in order to recruit an army to deal with inho with people dependent on dokja for food and then their very lives he could easily seize control of the station but i suppose power isnt his goalnot a single coin spent herewowowowowowi’m glad they are finally fighting those bastards constellation water sound and wind sound wanna see biyu asapgilyeong is so cute omghell yeah dokja go offf u are a literal icon i love this story so muchhow can you expect someone to be morally good if you yourself are not morally goodsee how filthy humans can be arent they ashame tsk tsk tskwhy is it the more not nice but not evil makes they more hotloudly_crying_faceoops this quickly turn into horror huh hshshyeonseongshi is so precious i want to protect him like holy poop hes so cute hhnnnggg ∆dif i were him i would only help the people who were close with me and part of my group the women the boy and the other mani like this side of dokja i think dokja will end up as an antivillain or an antihero as we can see here he is still a good guy but has some evil qualities by not sharing his coins though i do agree with his decisionmeanwhile ima take a guess as to who sangahs constellation is httpsenwikipediaorgwikiariadne and dont tell me if im righti know hes seems like hes turing to a villain but i bet this is something hes doing just to scare them he really doesnt want to be the bad guyim so glad he isnt a generic character this is getting so gooddio “you dare challenge meyes pop off clapping_handsclapping_handsclapping_handshe pulled a iq on them wonder how hes going to make it outyeah i am glad that he didn’t just follow

rolling_on_the_floor_laughingyeah think the man could spare us some coinsthere wasn’t any point in sharing coins the situation would repeat once and again and in the end people would still die and he’d be in an unfavourable situation with little to no coins he is not assessing the situation morally but practically in the long run he cannot really help themyuh dokja just snappedwelp natural selection bishes morals wont save you rn and thats how that man became withered chicagrinning_face_with_smiling_eyesactually i liked dokjas decision as all the people there didnt had any morals right now & they are just burdens with selfish motivesits apocalypse do i have time to be nice i dont think sogod im so glad dokja isnt some kind of a saint too naive to just give coins to those people thats the reality you gotta knock or even slice some arms to give sense to some people loli love dis me whenever someone wants me to share my food because they think ill always be kind to them ughumm this is interesting i like this approach he’s takingdont you dare

dokjadamn this webtoon is gold keep up the good work manthis is soo my favorite webtoon i love the storyline along with characters and the drawing stylewhat a badasshis plan is to break the control of that influencer he is truly a terrifying villain he has to take him out before he levels up morewhy does this feel like fallout soo much dat buttshit i wanna sword like thatme reading episode on seriesalso me wow i like thems artsanyone say antihero because i thought i heard antihero lmaotell em dokjai thought dokja was just going to say myeonghan has coins to spare so he doesnt become the villain and doesnt lose coinsyou tell em dokjai didnt think this would be so good during the first few chapters im glad i didnt drop itwoeiooww theses people i want to fucking straggle themwow so much thought was put into this webcomicoooh this is getting excitingbihyung why you look so cutesneezing_facesneezing_faceguys be ready for the unpredictable scammer kim dojegai love they changed the perspective and made it seem like he was the bad guy and good guy at the same timei am loving this series so muchgreen shirt dudeim going to kill youdokja face_with_tears_of_joy nopepeople people attack the other dudehe looks scaryi like itohohoh some gonna die tonightthis is badhow can they just say that likethey should try to prove thier worth instead of trying to kill him like how dumb are youhe have more coins because of some reason peoplehes right though why should he give them coins also if he did the next time the fee shows up they are going to rely on him to give them coins then it turns into a cycle which might end him with no coinsi like the fact that the others are still behind him obviously positioned to protect himfireyesss use logic not moralitygod damn this boy has some principles and im excited to see them like of course u ugly dead meats why would he do that hes not ur legal guardian or anything square the fk upi called there was gonna be a giant mantis i knew itthis is amazing dokja is awesome i always love a badass character damn fearful_faceface_screaming_in_fearmy jaw lower than my short a of yess hes backwait wait wait wait wait he can essentially borrow skills right what if he borrows incite to turn everyone against the guy who was sending people out in the first placethis story isn’t exactly one of my favorites rn but it just gets more and

himself the only sacrifice while everyone else can survive damndaamn i love him slay bich slay them allwhat i think he should do is give them coins but only if they give him the survival reward so they all live gain respect for dokja and he also gets his coins backman even tho bihyeong is kinda a ass he gets better on in later scenesfinally a character who is looking out for themselves before other people it’s refreshing bihyeongthank god i was praying that he didn’t give the coinskinda reminds me of this situationkids at lunch buy lunch food even thought they sat its badthese guys bought

wrongdokja is now my favorite characterhes an anti heroi love the morality of dokja he makes such a thrilling character to have as the narrator and lead in so many other stories he would have just

uwumyungoh can’t be long for this world wonder what will happen to all of those coins when he becomes a “mother” or is murdered by the demon king of whatever and how many people that could have given a chancei knew that bug would be important since it was the only normal giant looking creature that we have seen so faredit but i never thought a normal giant insect would have the rank of a monarch thanks soo dokaebi communication is basically private chat love how he doesn’t give a care in the world let’s be honest this is a realistic way of looking at things damn those eye bags tho our poor dokja isn’t getting enough sleep pensive_facehe is the goat so what if he has cheat codes it’s all about self in the endi i am speechless hahaha the dokakabi is acting all shy and jealous cus dokja did something awesome and he wasnt their to gain credit for the stream dokakabi so ugh noticed wile i was away you did some pretty amazing stuffwhat i felt he was trying to say you dont like the other

and i regret nothingthe constellation hanae_saku liked dokja a lot coins have been awarded i used the free coins earned for an event because i want to support the artist i hope to read moregosh dangit i want more i just fast forward using all my coins and i dont regretno one is good they wanto still moneyi cant wait for more updates 🤩🤩🤩im all about the daily uploads i will gladly spend my money for this webtoonbut from what i read this guy is pretty much the line and does who desire to disrupt that line is considered an annoyance i for one respect that is there a new chapter every dayman i really hate praying mantis even as it isinlove yeess we needed this dokja doesnt deserve to take smack from anyone show em whos boss imagine spending all of your weeks worth of lunch money for coins without your parents knowledge i think i messed upi dont remember what the little demon is thats controlling the game but i like the guy i know hes demonic and all but i still like himi like him as a character not the other wayfirst time reader opinions i think dokja is about to learn a new bookmark skill but what would happen if two incite skills clashed interesting to see indeedlove this omgf u f them what makes me the enemy love this twist and realismour protagonist is such a badass i love his reasoning and how he can be so cold sometimesi think im going to reread this webtoon from the very beginning its just so very goodi feel bad at how easily they are corrupted always a great read im definitely hoping you an get funding for a tv showcant stress the notouch policy enough these daysgotta love characters that do what they need to survive and don’t puss up at every turngetting super tasty lemme see tha da next clup pleaze kind sirwell if theyd actually work harder they would have coins like dokja said they killed someone to stay and why should this be his problem go boy chop chopthe constellation greedy storyarc devourer alpha thinksdikja should buy the peoples loyalty if they want coins he should get something in return the constellation greedy storyarc devourer alpha thinks dokja should go ahead and kill that dudeis this still going to update daily this mights just be me but im begging you to keep it that waywow thats cool the blooded dont dokija but it is the bosses followed because hes just being a prickthis sword is so epicbased neutral oh i love dokjathe crowd is about to turn on the people who sold the food for triple the amount im glad dokja isnt a pussy idiot mcyes dokja god i love dokja this was amazing im thrilled i love thiss story now that is what i call chaotic good smiling_face_with_hornsset the tone dok clear out the useless extras and then get onto the villainsyes dokja defend yourselfsheesh dude aint playin no games with yallthe dude in the red at the end looks like he shat himselfomg this man just went sicko mode so beautiful there deadyoobeautiful so god damn beautiful damn bro dokja turning hella sick nowi really love how many twist and turns this story takes but when dokja goes cold face he says f those twist and turns ones desire to live should never delve to the depths of unnecessary violence applaud the player for their insight and not blame their ability to do well when others flounderidk what webtoon i love more this or the gamertake my money but in a serious note who can blame him or the people it’s about to go down eyesi greatly approve of dokja our mc right now i mean he still has the moral high ground most of those people are there because they killed someone and still refuse to be responsible for their own lives or actions why should he help them it would actually be pointless since they wouldnt learn anything morally the right action is to let them suffer the consequences for their choices so that if they survive maybe theyll change on their owni would like a psycho mc hehe am getting tired of the good and cringey onesim so glad dokja doesnt have the saviour complex that most mcs tend to have dthiss i mean i dont like the character who always been taken advantage by others i love how he isnt a very morally goody shoeshes like its an apocalypse frick u toomy spirit animal kim

love not morally good protagonists dokja has such an amazing characteri just wanna say i love you all so much thank you for creating this webtoon ugh i’m so glad dokja isn’t a pushover and won’t just do whatever benefits everyone else also hes so coolnice mc vibesi hope that this doesn’t have any smart clever outcome and dokja just butchers all the fools who thinks he owes them anything dokja is so woke thumbs_updokja and his gang are the ppl i wanna hang out with i love me a morally grey character this is the definition of sparkleslet your inner demon shineeesparklesthe audacity of these people is rlly out of hand you ate his food that he risked his life for youve done n o t h i n g at all youre not entitled to his helpthis guy is the definition of virtue signalingyeah you tell em kdj fricking idiots xdauthor nim youre the bestyes this is a realistic character why did i wait so long to read this loving the antihero twist other than the pushover mcsim sorry but thats hotdokja is turning out to be the anti hero type hes good but he will kill if he has todokja is more and more reminding me of sung jin woohahahahahah hahahahhahahaahahhaahhahahhaahahahahaahahhaathat character who got his arms cut off surprised pikachu faceoverhaul i know how that feelshippity hoppity my coins are your propertyumm that was hot 🥵 a whole new meaning of disarming your enemysometimes being a villain is far better than being a hero smirking_facesmirking_facewoa some people in these comments genuinely scare me where is your humanity why are so many people so happy the mc might not be a good guy when did being a good person become boring if this was a real scenario and you genuinely wouldnt help people when you could at least the children in this crowd then idk what to say but you need to think about what kind of person you are damn papi you a rare breedhah this is why i absolutely love coldquiet people they al always have an interesting instinct being a villain is better than hero in my perspectiveever protagonists says “how pathetic” in a scary way with there pupil dilated i dont think i have ever loved a mc more than i love him i truly hate self righteous mcsat first i was like mhmm “men with swords” as a joke but bro i don’t think it’s a joke anymore tired_facelove how he reacted this webtoon is amazing through all but the mc makes it times better the world they live in is twisted i know but the mc is right for many reasons im seriously going to start crushing on himdokja reminds me of khun from tower of godi love that it’s not your typical righteous protagonist give me some realityidk about anyone else but i was like finally my godddgreatt character development so realistic and not idealistic tbh i would prob do the same being a good person is cool now but in a situation like that it’s jst being weak it’s jst letting others manipulate u for personal gain at that point i would sorta jst be like “fuck it”yes finally a character whos not a bitch this is why i loved solo levelingfinally he is all out of mercynice i like that they are just evilhe has every right not to give them coins they killed ppl he can use that as an excuse if he doesn’t wanna seem evil cuz he killed bugsi think children at least deserve your help but at the end its a survival of the fittest scenario not a charitymost of the people there killed other people to survive so why should he give coinsi like the way dojka just helps people that actually does need it and i honestly love the way he is not stick on being the good ass guy but instead a fair one literally loving itdokja doesnt take shit and i love it so much pathetic humansused all their coins and blame someone else for their stupidity trash deserves to be destroyedits the apocalypse my dudes ahhi stand by dokjahe is doing the right thing i dont see these people doing anything to live other than just surviving theres a big difference they took human life to get where they are now coins each thats more nights of life or instead of squatting they could you know work on the scenarios at hand face_with_rolling_eyes dokja is taking the moral high

have to be forced to give them back his coins for the decision they made also they all have commit murder and probably more sins that no one know dokja earn those with his in strategies that ending scene was fire fire as wellim just wondering how his friends will react to this i mean i kind of agree with him but i hope his friend dont turn on himdojka kinda reminds me of dream omg he is so badass i love him smiling_face_with_heart-eyes and ugh this comic is soo underrated like most of the romance webtoon a are given more attention which is fine but they miss gems like these

the fact you chose to stay in the station how dare you try to kill me for trying to keep you from another’s clutches gotta show some fear to be respected sometimes needy people sharing is caring me im not a care bear purple_heartim personally just annoyed of the finally protagonist that does something morally questionable as if every protagonist of these types of stories werent some sort of anti heroes who everytime they do something morally righteous they are like nah nah im doing this definitely for selfish reasonslike not crapping on peoples tastes here im just confused if they really dont realize that majority of web novel series have similar protagonists to here or make choice seem less edgy lateri dont disagree with dokjas choice but couldnt he have said that mr han has more momey than him even if its a liethinking_facei hate how the main character is slowly turning into a psycho i really pains methis is a lesson on why socialism is doodoogee ive never had top comment trump is like the dokkaebi making rules that cost lives lots of people will dieso wait if he lets everyone have a bite of the food wouldnt that complete the scenario for everyone so they wouldnt all lose coins unless im missing a stepi really appreciate that hes not willing to get pushed around thoughhe is kind of a bitch dont like him for looking down on those people just because he got lucky and happend to read the right story he wouldve been on their place if he didnt well no actually he would be dead from that edgeguy from the train i dont mean he should give his money to everyone but at least dont be a brat thinking they all deserved that maybe they killed insects too who knowshes lee gilyeong not gilyeong lee why you do this its korean webcomic why the names are written like in eu or america

webtoon theres a website that you can read for free now there are over chapters in the website so dont waste your money there are other platforms that has episode and it free grimacing_faceslightly_smiling_faceim staying cause theres a slim chance of hope but this is total garb_ age i mean come on just kill the sk m already & those r_ tards as well gods sakedojka seems kind of hypocritical to me he helps out only the people he knows he even helps that little boy but when there is another child that needs coins to survive he turns a blind eye i get not giving coins to the other people but at least for childrenthe thing is that author intentionally made those plain people become evil and start blaming him so he can keep looking down on them but not all are like that and in real life there would probably be more people just crying or begging then stratight attacking him so i find him a total bitch for being that arrogant he couldve done something for example really share coins with the rest who didnt attack him it wouldnt be much at all and he would probaby get even more as donation for his deedhe couldve killed the major group and gave their coins to those in need totally so fck this mc hypocrite or he coudlve at least tried to do smth maybe he will in next chapter but i doubtcharacter i have black hair commenter his hair is black whiner omg how dare you spoil it do you all realize how ridiculous you sound when you whine about spoiling have none of you ever read a book ex harry potter then find out it gets made into a movie and be excited for it anyways even though you already know everything that happens from beginning to end like seriously spoilers dont actually spoil anything you still enjoy the the cartoonmovie get the hell over yourselvesplease don’t speak in absolutes i don’t think the story progressed far enough you’ve given us yoo the main protagonist given broken faith a buff then gave it to the reader and you giving the

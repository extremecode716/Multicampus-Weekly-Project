Star Stream they earn a Fable  DOKJA YOUVE ALWAYS BEEN A KING IN MY EYES ü•∫ü•∞üíï Ok So fables were called stories in the novel Earning a fable does not equate becoming a fable constellation All constellation have accumulated fables and incarnations can accumulate fables as well The accumulated fables make up the constellations power in their case and thats why their ranked usually by how wellknown their fables are I saw a few people getting confused over this I dont have the biggest issue with the translation change but its starting to cause confusion did this seem short I know it wasnt short but it seemed shortam I just being greedy I want morehere are my 5 ü™ôI will pay more üò≠ The last panel is so beautiful You can see the pain on his face but his determination is strong So we all agree that King of a Kingless World sounds so much better and that‚Äôs the translation we‚Äôll be using right  I BLESS EVERYONE THAT ARE INVOLVE IN THIS WEBTOON TO HAVE CLEAR SKIN GOOD MEALS AND MAY ODDS BE IN THEIR FAVOR AT THE END OF THE DAY THANK YOU FOR THIS MASTERPIECE And so the story begins This feels like the prologue Now I am excited to see how each character develops their abilities new constellations to be introduced and the wonderful new items  Thank you for this great adventure üíô who else had Goosebumps when the constellations started looking down on him  King of a Kingless World just hits different why does the novel names and fan translated always hit better üò© Wow I got goosebumps Thank you for this having not read the book i am LOSING my shit here I appreciate the people correcting the translations but sometimes I just want to go to the comments and talk about how cool the chapter was Most of the time I dont even care about the misstransaltions Round of applause for this episode üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè Goddamn that was amazing This episode was REVOLUTIONARY THANK YOU AUTHOR D If he becomes important enough could he become a constellation  The writing the story telling the climax and the ending of this one episode is just utterly outstanding Chills just chills Its so beautifully written and Im not going to miss a single bit of this because its amazing i got rising chills as more constellations looked at him god i love this webtoon  chills literal chills from this chapter King of the Kingless World you have achieved a nonexistant achievement Yeah  that sounds plausible  I was mesmerized by the way they stacked the speech bubbles to indicate there are multiple voices but damn I didnt expect that emotional scene at all got me teared up with the togetherness trope lmao Im weak with that trope But seriously how dokja can think of anything so clearly every time is a bit too OP lol I dont think I could react like him even if I got isekaid to my favorite mmorpg that Ive played for 8 years Surely Id make a lot of blunders and doubting myself lol MY HEART Please I wish everyone who has Webtoon reads this It deserves every single adaptation known to mankind for being so fcking amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Man this series Rocks I legit started to tear up when the constellations saved him   The GUY just unlocked A HIFDEN ACHIVMENT Damn what a good chapter I love the subtle change of the raindrops on the titlelogo I know translating webtoon is hard so thank you for your effort despite the barrage of criticism but Id hoped the translators take care with the research and the phrasing more Ive noticed several times that some choice of translations removed a good chunk of foreshadowings it makes me sad what kind of anime finale heartstrings pulling shit is this how DARE you make me emotional A feat so great that you are awarded an achievement that doesn‚Äôt exist That‚Äôs beyond true gaming  Although the webtoons translation is okay theres so much mistranslation and better words they couldve used King of a World without a King is one big missed opportunity to just put King of a Kingless World as it sounds better Idk about the other translations but I hope webtoon could hear out the readers and use the rightbetter  translation  I‚Äôm not crying your crying  man Binyeongs streaming channel must be soaring through the roof i wanna see his reaction  As strong as this chapter is there are some things it can be improved on translation wise Like King of a world without a king would have sounded better as King of a Kingless World because during the last 5 players involved yeah they were kings but are they still after losing since there is only supposed to be one King in the end to take the throne but he destroyed it So the other kings wouldnt be kings anymore after losing if I saw how the event worked  Damn Actual chills at the end there One of my favorite chapters The art was gorgeous and the pacing and paneling was done really well that was beautiful when you become the main character üò≠üò≠ wipes tear Im waiting for you in the ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ† Dokja ‚ú® I literally cried at the end its so damn good and as a novel reader who loves this story heartily the importance of this fable and the emotions I felt this chapter ahhhh it was soooo good the only thing I didnt like is the webtoon using king of the world without a king instead of king of kingless world I feel so attached to the latter And all these starsconstellations sharing the aftermath of plausibility is heart warming I also like how his friends were so worried for him  All the top comments are about translation mistakes are we not gonna acknowledge how fucking badass that was he made all the constellations so intrigued by him that they want him to live ‚úãüò≠ This arc is so beautiful  The constellations are watching a show run how they‚Äôve never seen it run before They‚Äôve grown to like him and his interesting talewatching him die would bring only sorrow for them so they‚Äôre helping him live they can‚Äôt allow their show to end a show with it‚Äôs most interesting character gone is no longer as interesting or special I like other translations better ‚Äúking of a kingless world‚Äù Dokja Im going to do whats called a pro gamer moveProceeds to destroy major plot device Intern creating a brand new story why did this feel so so so uh idk how to explain but like powerful did anyone else cry when the constellations shares the plausibility no just me ok holy shit the last panel beautiful  Whoever said Dokja wasnt hot is wrong SHEEEESH this chapter gave me literal chills Dokja is so COOLüò≠‚ù§Ô∏è The first tale of this story has been aquired Im getting goosebumps nThe fact that the

reader of the reader of the world smiles upon you When the constellations started looking at him one by one Oh god that scene was awesome  I know the majority of manhwascomics are based off of light

I FIND THIS WHOLESOME IM ALMOST CRYING was i the only one teary eyed when the constellations started looking at dokja when he was in pain ü•∫ one of the most memorable scenario in the webnovel  webtoon made it possible seeing it come to life ‚úãüèª holy shit dokja is so incredible üò≠ he‚Äôs strong intelligent brave and has the constellations on his side  he‚Äôs unmatched fr This chapter was E P I C Can we just pause for a sec and thank the author for this This is so beautiful üò≠‚úã this chapter will have my HEART always  the last panel is so beautiful istg I dont know why but this chapter had some feeling in it This was probably the coolest episode so far It makes me so excited üòÅüòé For a second I thought that Dokja was gonna become a costellation was I the only one the constollation god of üñ§shipsüñ§ is sharing the burden after being away for about a week because ofrestrictions speechless what beautiful writing  some of the translations are wonky king of a kingless world is better but overall a fantastic chapter and climax to one of my fav arcs X Thank you for the story author this is just Incredible for some reason this chapter was emotionally deep loved it  oo continues to eat popcorn slowly  so glad Im not the only one who read the novel then went here to read the comic as well anyone else terrified to stop reading Who brought the onionsüò≠ This webtoon is amazing ‚ô•Ô∏è Got to be honest when the constellations were looking at him it felt badassgood job king of the kingless world dokja we are all here to listen to your story constellationyou will surely dieplot armor like am I a joke to you The hairs on my arms stood up while reading this So freaking good read üò≠ I waited literally all day for this It did not disappoint This is my favorite web toon The art the plot the character development all of it Just amazing Thank you author for making my day a little better ‚ù§ Author Artist and all of those that helped make this chapter a reality thank you very much love the chapter but i honestly prefer ‚Äûking of a kingless world‚Äú and ‚Äûouter gods‚Äú a lot more as possible translations King of a kingless world  m imagining a Netflix series lol The storytelling of this webtoon is unmatched Each chapter tops the last They need to adapt this into an anime asap üî•üî•üî• This is why Omniscient Reader is my favorite webtoon absolutely stunning from art to story magnificent it somehow made me a lil emotional when all those screen messages of the various Constellations showed up helping him burden the plausibility dokja is pretty amazing  Dont worry about the blood folks Its just internal bleeding and internal is where the blood is supposed to be anyway the art is just chefs kiss even the constellations wants to see the Dokjas story and now he has a FABLE A Kingless World ‚ú® im a novel reader but i think yall too pressed about mistranslations unless it really disrupts the plotunderstanding its not much of a big deal errwhy not just say king of a kingless world its easier and thats how they refer to it in the light novel this is one of my favourite scenes in the novel the moment when dokja made his first step towards the end the moment the concept of probability was first introduced the moment dokja became King of the kingless world the moment everything started going downhill to all that are reading this for the first time prepare yourselves because not even the Fourth wall can save you from the hardships thats gonna come in the following arcs ORV true story starts here For those who are confused what is fable think of legendarymythical heros They have their own storyfables becoming a heroic beings like Hercules going through 12 labors Odysseus trojan horse Sun Wukong starting a war against heavens It is their achievements that show their strength and spread their reputation In ORV such stories are called fables and this fable system is very important directly related to constellationincarnation‚Äôs strength Damn yall being picky with the wording Enjoy the story either way ya salty scrubs Yo Dokja is SUCH a BADDIE Literally the Constellations love him so much or at least respect him so much that they were willing to SHARE PAIN with a MERE HUMAN Dokja truly is incredible DOKJA IS SO PRETTY LOOK AT THAT LAST PANEL AHHHHH My man just weaves out a new storyline Make your own path blaze your own trail Believe in yourself This is by far the best webcomic on webtoon in my personal opinion keep it up The art in this chapter was amazing‚Ä¶ author started out with great art style and it‚Äôs only gotten better and better with each episode Wow  this gave me chills  This has been an amazing series thus far but this chapter has pushed it into legendary territory Bravo author the grip dokja has on my soul That was so fucking cool  i got chills when the constellations helped dokja that was so cool  Got goosebumps when the constellations started to share the burden of plausibility this episode felt so cinematic i got shivers reading it  Wha WHAT This is just too much I cant even find the words to say how much I love this story it just blows my mind EVERYüëè SINGLEüëè CHAPTERüëè and Im living for it Omniscent Reader is just amazing The Naval warefare god is a real one for being the first to share the burden The Bald army general probably helped as a way to pay dokja cause he dosen‚Äôt have many coins omg üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ this was so beautiful  My man really knows whats what this is what makes him an awesome character Im loking at you Dokja ‚ù§ i hoped they kept the title king of the kingless world from the novel for me it sounds better Also at the end the title panel shouldve been kinda smudged or wobbly coz the artist intended for it to be that way to give it a crumpledsadlonely effect To add with the feeling of the rain and Dokjas condition at the end The artist gave a good adaptation so i just think its good to honor their efforts now it just seem like some of its wasted I hope this isn‚Äôt ending any time soon I feel like it‚Äôs only really started Its been quite some time since I was so impacted by a story A New Fable Dokjas story to tell Thanks Author Artists and all collaborators for this amazing tale The fucking GOAT  i miss our initial broadcaster this one is so buthurt and angry all the time  He really is such an amazing character The Gods respect him he beat the strongest man he defied the rulers of scenarios he broke the system into rewarding him with a non existent achievement he a mere human became the highest rank of constellations and most importantly he created the ending he wanted and became The King of a World Without a King Talk about a hardcore stargazer‚Ä¶ When the constellations started to share his burden you can just tell that they aren‚Äôt just in it to be entertained anymore they really want Dokja to survive because they can‚Äôt comprehend him that was quite the cinematic experience Dokja you majestic bstard üò≠  a mysterious ruler has noticed a sudden chance in this world shouldnt that be change not chance Ive completed the novel but seriously Im so emotional to see him create his first fable üò≠üò≠ King of a kingless world his first big achievement  Man I straight up got chills while Im loving every single episode this one just hit me different Why cant I live more than one like üò≠  this episode brought the thrills and the feels Quite an astonishing moment I would not lie Beautiful  Im just gonna leave this comment here so I can come back and remember this chapter This chapter made me emotional They shared the burden TT even though constellations are beings who treat human life like worms this was very humane for them üò¢  okay but whos still amazed by everythingITS ALL SO GOOD AND PRETTY AND SPECTACULAR these last four chapters are what made me the fan of this series SO BEAUTIFUL woah Okay but hear me out What if Dokja is the author of TWSA but he doesn‚Äôt know yet Dokja might not be the protagonist of TWSA but he sure is worthy to be the protagonist of this web comic Super epic episode omg  Ah it brought me to tears how the constellations helped him üíõüíõüíõüíõüíõü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ the writing is top tier dear lord I got so many shivers from this dang this was honestly amazing to read I feel almost a part of it lol This is so beautiful üòç dude this would be so epic if it was animated king of a kingless world kim dokja üëèüëè Im speechlessDokja sacrifice the constellations helping him just a beautiful lovely chapter I remember when dokja was just s guy in the office who loved reading that book DOKJAAAA‚ô° THIS CHAPTER IS INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL IM ABOUT TO CRY AGAIN WITH SO MUCH HAPPINESS WITHIN ME‚ô°nTHE FEELS BRO THE FEELS‚ô° I was really trying to ignore the silly translation but thats itWTF IS THE KING OF THE WORLD WITHOUT A KING IF YOU DONT CHANGE IT RIGHT NOW IMMA SLAP SOMEONE WITH YJHngimme my King Of A Kingless World back like üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ im amazed at this fanbase people have a good eye for mistakes in the translation AND IM AMAZED AT THE END OF THIS EPISODE SKDHDLFJKD DOKJA WHAT ON EARTH JUST HAPPENED I honestly would love it more if they translated it to King of a Kingless World cause that would be more memorable  Ok but the fact that Dokja is the definition of Good eveningGod has let me live another day and im making it EVERYBODYS problem Now that‚Äôs a fable I can enjoy ‚ÄúA king in a World without a King‚Äù Catchy let‚Äôs see where this King can go on his grand crusade I was gonna read the next chapter but I just had to reread this one and the chills remain intact aldjaldjsjdjd ah yes king of a kingless world the most powerful fable to have ever existed Dark Dimension Nah it sounded cooler when it referred to them as Eldritch Ooh the first probability storm Truthfully Dokja is probably the only one other than Junghyuk or Sooyung who could even survive it right now And the first Fable‚Ä¶ now this was the moment things changed  Holy shit thatsIuh its amazing i am so in love with this story Woahhhhh I am left speechless This was beautiful woohooooodokjaaa soooo coool WELL USE THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP  The Constellations all jumping in there at the end to protect our boy was just so beautiful  That was the most incredible chapter Ive ever read This story is VERY interesting I cant wait to see how the story unfolds THAT WAS DOPE So what‚Äôs his story he wanted to tell holy hell I have goose bumps this episode was so insane new fable baby Those constellations are homies for sharing the probability wow i finally catched up üòçüò≥ Doesn‚Äôt this mean Dokja is himself a constellation now Or has the potential to become one WowI love this comic in general for its world building art and story  but this is the first time Dokja has seemed so heroic vs pragmatic as he was willing to risk death for the slight chance the world could be saved And the stars setting sail chills I dont really understand what just happened but Dokja is like a legend now rightü§© That was amazing Feels like a new arc will begin soonits going get even more epic isnt it if yall think this is good just you wait it gets even better  This was full and completely serious Dokja Shit actually got real Im stunned by this episode  What a chapter üò≠üò≠üò≠ the birth of a fable Im kinda sad they stick to fables when they already used stories before but OK ahhhh Im crying I love this so much Dokja YOU ACTIVATED MY TRAP CARD BALD ARMY GENERAL IM SRRYWKSKDJJD LETS GO KING Dokja became a legend in his own right this chapter The artwork was dope as always üî•üëç Wow I really love this webtoon Dokja being the King of the Kingless and what he did is really cool I cant wait to see how else he will surprise me in the future  my fav manwha of all time THE LIMBS I WOULD SELL JUST TO WATCH THIS ANIMATED The constellations could have benefited from their incarnations getting the Fable But they still chose to share Dokjas pain because they support what he did üò≠ NOW THIS IS THE KIND OF WEBTOON THAT DESERVES TO BECOME A MOVIE OR A SERIES King of a Kingless World sounds way more badass ngl Goosebumps and sadness when Dokja said he only has one shot at his ending  THIS IS SO GOOD MY FAVORITE STORY EVER I‚Äôm in love with every single one of these characters my heart and mind is racing This is what I want to do I‚Äôm in love with everything about this Thank you wow‚Ä¶ this story never ceases to amaze me i got tearyeyed when the constellations shared the burden and mooooore tearyeyed when dokja achieved something unfathomable i felt so proud favorite story on webtoon rn üõê This chapter was amazing I usually never leave comments on webtoon but this will be my first since 2 years of using webtoon This was amazing it left a great impact and I believe the story is progressing beautifully This was a BOMB chapter üëåüèæüëåüèæüëåüèæ Dokja be snatching constellations left and right  A king indeed Danm The constellations certainly have a favorite XD THIS IS A MASTERPIECE Yall I couldnt wait for the updates so I read the translated comic online When I caught up to that I read the entire web novel it took me two weeks filled with endless laughter and tears Its long but written the way youd read a webtoon I highly suggest fans read the novel to get your fix PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SOMEONE ANIMATE THIS SERIES  King of a kingless word sounds much better A world without king Cheesy af please change it to king of the kingless world it sounds much cooler and thats how it is in novel plus ruler of dark dimension outer god make it this way it will make sense in future one of the memorable chapters Yellow box I assume this means it is a higher ruling authority than the system used to create the blue boxes Remember when this was just killing bugs Ive been here since episode one and damn things change so quick This chapter was amazing Time to go get some free coins I can‚Äôt handle this cliffhanger The fact that Dokja got basically all the constellations on his side and created a new fable is really something It really shows you don‚Äôt need a sponsor to win the favour of the constellations the constellations are actually seeming to be pretty good now huh I NEED MORRRRE i needed a moment for that to sink in i was just sitting staring unblinkingly at my screen not even reading the top comments that i had just scrolled to applause for the author i was literally speechless Thank god the constellations intervened My respect for them increased I very much enjoyed this King of the world without a king oof King of a Kingless world sounded better Either way some dope shit coming up The King of the world without a king I still prefer the King of a Kingless World I hope they dont change the names like what happened in the translation in the novel in between cause its going to be a mess And the Outer Gods too Sigh Anyways but still I LOVE THIS SCENE Yes its the beginning Its starting Though Im 8 chapters ahead in the Manhwa Still I support Lezzgo  ‚ÄòA mysterious ruler sees his chance in this world‚Äô ‚Ä¶now whos this Every chapter of this Webtoon is a gem This chapter gave me literal chills The fact that the constellations heard his wish for how he wanted to change the story and rewrite it theyre invested and they are looking out for him Thats such a big feat To have the constellations following your story Man dokja and his gang really came through  Yall what just happened I want to read the original TWSA just to compare it to this cause I feel like the significance about some of this stuff is downplayed by our lack of knowledge of how things should be going in the original TWSA and how the world works meaning the story in the first world should have ended when he takes the throne so dokja managed to not end the story in the first world therefore no regression therefore part 2   I was astonished enthralledhappy scared bewilderedProud  throughout the chapter A total package Kim Dokjawhat a amazin character he is  AHHHH I WISH I HAVE MORE COINS I CANT WAITüò≠ dokja went to so many places did so many things but at the end is still wearing a jacket give my mam some clothes please üòÇ The plot is amazing the characters are amazing the art is amazing just everything about this Webtoon is absolutely amazing‚ÄºÔ∏èüò© what a great name King of the world without a kingI was waiting for it from novel Wowthis actually made me speechless for a bit Even with some mistranslations even with a bit of the mistranslations this chapter WAS SO GOOD  yall are complaining about translations and stuff but its still a dope ass novel just enjoy it just remembered where has Gilyeong been this whole time its just sooooooo cool the power of storytelling  saving a story and having the viewer save you a story gains its power from what its readers want the levels  the layers  ough Damn Dokja really willing to die for this  T T cant help but love these constellations for supporting Dokja got bit teary there Cant wait to see whats next oo This episode is gorgeous The art the story Just wow i do hope this gets an anime cause the scene in this episode with all the constellations is BEAUTIFUL Oohh did y‚Äôall notice that the title got rain drop stains  Please listen to the people who say that King of a Kingless World is better because King of a world without a king is quite possibly the worst thing to say and read in the history of reading and writing my heart stopped for a moment I thought this was the end üòüüò≠ü•∫ It looks impressive to me that Dokja was willing to die or at least suffer a tremendous pain just for the sake of saving the world  That is Just awesome I am so grateful to the author for giving us such a beautiful funny epic and tragic story It has been a long time since I havent loved a fiction that intensely Thank you so much I cant wait to see what is in store outside Seoul now  Favorite episode so far in Omniscient Reader WOW‚Ä¶üëèüëèüëè BEST CHAPTER THAT LAST LINE IS SOOO GOOD  Dude This has me cryING SO good üò≠üåüüåü just caught up finally im gonna be spending a lot of money on this comic arent i A new constellation has joined the star stream The constellation ‚ÄòDestinys Requiem‚Äô gazes in wonder upon the incarnation ‚ÄòDokja Kim‚Äô The constellation ‚ÄòDestinys Requiem‚Äô deeply approves of the incarnation ‚ÄòDokja Kim‚Äôs‚Äô actions thus far You have received 25 coins yo is our boy Dokja gonna start building up enough fables to become a constellation And this is the moment where everything begins ‚ú® if you haven‚Äôt yet I totally recommend finding and reading the novel to this If you‚Äôre enjoying the manga you‚Äôll love the novel so does that mean Dokja is being made into a protagonist now Dokja you‚Äôre a handsome bachelor incarnation why are you so surprised you‚Äôre popular  My poor ass is sponsoring you 5 coins a week too  Kinda wish it was ‚Äústory‚Äù rather than ‚Äúfable‚Äù but amazing feat nonetheless  The Constellation Child of the Chaotic Mask is stunned by what has transpired  5 Coins have been giftedSeriously though WTF just happened Does this mean Dokja has earned the right to become a Constellation himself The last panel the message this whole chapterThe dang onion cutting ninjas are back ‚ï•Ôπè‚ï• the last pics he looks so beautiful ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ Man this is so cool wtf Something about the constellations taking pity on a human and sharing the burden almost made me tear up ü•∫‚ú® he looks so pretty in the last panel Reading this gave me chills that I rarely experience Good job Author You made a good WebToon THE GOOSEBUMPS READING THIS CHAPTER and i much prefer calling the fable King of a Kingless World just because it sounds cooler that way 33 So we aint gonna talk about how Dokja looks so beautiful in that position or im just stupid and a simp in the last panel i mean i can stare at it for hours mind blown rn ngl dokja be lookin pretty sexy in that last panel BEAUTIFULLLLL CHAPTERRRR This is supposed to be the official translation why so many changes Like I already dont like it when they change the King of No Killing and some skills now its King of the Kingless Word It kinda ruins the story since names like those are important details Please dont change more than you did already because Im scared that the iconic demon king‚óºÔ∏è‚óºÔ∏è or ‚óºÔ∏è Company or the Sacrificial ‚óºÔ∏è will be changed Like at least choose more fitting alternatives if you need to change the translation  It made me shed a few tears that Dokja was able to touch the constellations enough for them to decide to share the plausibility with him He changes the people around him damn this chapter was incredible nah this should defiantly get crunchyroll to do anime for this webtoon this is a webtoon where you dont need to fully understand the history cause you learn about it while rooting for these characters i cant stop stressing when dokja does something i think is stupid and win i know he will win but it always make me feel like hell lose this is too good to not get a anime that last panel 3 dokja my king of a kingless world CHILLS hopefully this manhwa will get at least the same amount of chapters as TWSA Why did the constellation of the prisoner of golden band didnt help woah love this chapter this webtoon is probably one of the best ive ever read  Woah i got the chills This is so beautiful dokja is so dope How does this series keep getting better and better the more imposible you think it is ü§©ü§©ü§© ive come a long way but i still dont know the difference between plausibility and probability can someone enlighten The art is so majestic This is so damn good Thank you authornim and artistnim and Webtoon of course for having this Such a great quality platform to read an exquisite manhwa üíï this is much way better than Solo leveling The art sooooo beautifulllll i never forget to save some panel and make it my phone wallpaper üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è this panel is chefs kiss This I too am watching Well damn that was incredibly touching and poetic This was so uniquiely poetic HYPE HYPE HYPE REALLY LOVED THE HYPED CREATED IN THIS CHAPTER DANG This was on of those beast episodes where Dokja just showed us how OP the omniscient reader powers in the right hands are Dang ü§Øü§Øü§Øüòµ Throne go poof HOLY PIECE OF PIZZA THIS CHAPTER GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS ALL OVER Oo MA LORD I CANT‚ô° dokja has some üçëüò≥ This brings the feels man  omg the cons are so niceüò≠ü§∫ It‚Äôs so heartwarming that Dokja has won the hearts of the constellations  Congratulations you have achieved a non existing achievement this is me but NEVER wait so youre telling me this isnt the end of a season That chapter sure fit perfect as one final anime first or second season that was so epic why am i crying i dont even know what feeling this is  what chapter is this in novel Please change ‚Äúking of a world without a king‚Äù to the original ‚Äúking of a kingless world‚Äù  There is an END why are you going to

 chills  ahh i‚Äôm so emotional he finally got first fable now this is where things really begin Note it almost almost criedüò∂ I literally stoped it haha HOLY SHIETYT I GOT CHILLSS As a reader of the web novel this chapter and the whole series was pure gold I wish they went with outer gods instead of rulers of the dark dimension though in their translation though Easily one of the best if not the best chapter so far  This chapter was epic üò≠üò≠üò≠ This just rose up to my top three fave webtoons quicker than Dokja can think goosebumps fucking goosebumps this arc is AWESOME Thank you constellations Thank you King of a Kingless World is where its at Im surprised many comments are saying the same l YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW BUMPY MY SKIN FEELS RN IM HAVING GOOSEBUMPS FOR THE PAST 3 MINUTES this chapter is fantastic god I love this so much The constelation daughter of a broken dream is looking forward the next chapter 5 coins have been gifted  I REMEMBER SEEING THAT SWORD IN A KDRAMA SO THATS WHAT IT IS Literally got chills this chapter Can‚Äôt wait to see where the series will go I bow my head in respect Damn Dokja back at your suicidal tendencies I see Amazing ep dokja is amazing That was so epic What a great payoff of all these separate interactions coming together loved this chapter  This scene hit me in the feels so hard  Let see what story this new fable will make King of the World Without a King love that last visual  This is literally taking your destiny by the hand  bro some of these comments forget that this isnt their webtoon story to make üíÄ Waaaaoooo this was unexpected Him turning into a fable possible a constellation if Im not wrong what an awesome success Kxnskfnwkdbws The last page was so beautiful Its sad how dokja took so much burden but amaizing how so many constellations started to support him from far away Is Dokja going to become a Constellation specifically the Constellation King of a Kingless World One of the best episodes so far this is the best webtoon ive ever read I much prefer Star Relic over Constellation Artifact The later may be accurate but the former just rolls off the tongue better Considering what they use to fight in this story I think its better to condense what you can Future fight scenes are going to be quite a mouthful as is which is why I also agree with the top comments  i cant even begin to say how much feelings this comic gives me this is illegal  Why not just keep using King of a Kingless World It sounds a lot better I want to see it animated  iis this what has become of the comments section now disputing translations i smell a end of season cliff hanger coming soon The Fable The King of the world without a king is one of my favorite story What a great chapter This webtoon never fails to amaze me dude just turned into a god without expecting Soo did he became a constellation   Will he be his own sponsor  I like how the title is smudged by raindrops A small but nice feature to match the scenery this chapter unironically gave me chills‚Ä¶ wow  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Dokja sweetie you really are a king arent you boy It was so heartwarming when all the constellations started helping Dokja ‚ù§Ô∏è  just amazing nice plot twist there D this is just too good very good for my heart üòÇ and here starts dokjas endless selfsacrificing nature that will piss junhyeok off ughh i just got goosebumps didnt think it would be possible with a webtoon ADFHJ Ngl this has been my favorite chapter so far Basically Dokja is breaking the entire game and i feel like this is just the beginning the goosebumps everytime üò´ I got literal chills when the constellations all teamed up to share the burden dayummm Dokja üò©üò≠ i‚Äôm obsessedddd omygoshhh ladies and gentlemen hes broken the game The constellations are rooting for him Wowim speechless Wow this was epic Well done very well made Can we all agree that Dokja is a boss Here comes the Kingless World did dokja become a fabled constellation this story is just the best its my favorite everything is unpredictable you did well author ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ could someone explain plausibility please me no get it ü§∑ This series just jumped from a high 8 to a high 9 or solid 10 which means imma reread the shit out of this I liked the dokabei before this one hes not even cute goosebumps all over the place in this chapter i loved every part of this whole chapter woooooow just wow I dont understand  what is a fable Damn this is so good ‚ï•Ôπè‚ï• I cant wait for the 5th scenario it will surely flood with comments „ÉΩ¬¥„Éº‰∫∫¬¥‚àáÔΩÄ‰∫∫–î¬¥„Éé Goosebumps on that last scene this is super good  This chapter is just chef kiss Holy sht that was amazing wait did he become a constellation but he should be a mythical not fabeled or whatever the most powerful one is he deserves to be at the top I hope he can make his way up still YEAH DOKJAAAAAA UR SO BADASSSSSSSS WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOO king of a kingless world is such a better title its the original translation from the novel The translation feels so bad It is in consistent there is complete lack of flow every name feels clunky and forced i starting to think that some trash translator company was hired to translate this webtoon it is has level of some intern who is non native english speaker which finished his education in middle school  NO they changed it from ‚ÄúKing of a Kingless World‚Äù TT man its annoying how many mistakes are made in these translations  Holy craaaaap it just gets better and better Good job to all the people working on this masterpeice WOOOOO This story is so wonderfully done Dokja has gone from being a reader who never chose to be anything more to someone willing to give everything up to tell the story he wants told Beautiful writing dokja look thicc in the last panel üò≤üòâ Honestly Im at my wits end with Webtoon translators Its getting progressively worse As a novel reader I cringe at many of the choices theyve  made Ruler of the dark dimension No its Outer God King of the World without a King FFS NO King of a Kingless World goosebumps seeing this scene drawn was amazingüò≥ I want to read novel BUT its way TOO long and I have VERY short patience üò≠ KING OF A WORLD WITHOUT A KING LETS GOOOOOO King of a Kingless World sounds much better tbh kinda wish whoever was translating this took some liberties Sure what was said was accurate but it certainly does not roll off the tongueEither way pog Fable 1 acquired Dojka managed to exceed my expectations once again üôÇ and the constellations helping him almost made me tear up tbh DDormamu This had me in tearsIt was so breathtaking And How is anyone even going to survive through the scenario if they havent read This is basically made so that no one survives right   Somehow seeing the boxes turn gold because yellow doesn‚Äôt sound as god looks so satisfying ‚≠êÔ∏è They are looking at you üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è Ah the Stars have Alligned or have they Me this WEBTOON has over 60 episodes should keep me busy a whileMe two days later time to start spending some coins Not regretting spending 5 coins on this chapter üò≠üëè I‚Äôm glad I spent my hard earned 5 coins ‚ú® thats some END OF SEASON ONE shit right there wtf ü§Ø This whole comic has just escalated in such a fantastic way When I started reading I would have never imagined the journey this story would take me on would be so amazing At this point I have no idea what will happen next but Im excited to find  out bro that was the best chapter yet omfg üëèüëèüëè Yo  this is SO FING GOOD  I dont think this episode is worthy of 5 coin like this ep is so heart warming and emotional I love this comic sooo much the extremely pissed off look of the White furry two horned gremlins face when Dojka was pretty much saying fck off I do what I want was funny as HELL but someone please take the time to read this and answer my few questions that I got cuz I didnt understand why the White furry gremlin was mad as HELL about the throne situation and I have a few questions to ask yall so please go and look at the questions in the replies sections some one please help It‚Äôs so good This is right up there with my favorite episode episode 40 I have absolutely no regrets spending coins on this Webtoon Damn it is so good this webtoon is the reason i‚Äôm broke and honestly i don‚Äôt regret a thing Take all of the coins I have I‚Äôm reading this like a movie and imagining it as such Goosebumps at the end of this episode can‚Äôt wait for the next one im so happy I put coins into this I love this comic so much the story keeps getting better and thrilling thank you I love this part so much but the name King of a Kingless World  Gosh that was so amazing I too would like to see the end that Kim Dokja wants ‚ò∫Ô∏è Wait are we seeing what I think we are seeing ‚ÄúA new fable has been created‚Äù and the name ‚Äúthe king of a world without kings‚Äù does this mean Dokja is becoming a constellation himself or am I reading too much into this THAT WAS EPIC wow Im in awe üò≥ Im really curious how redice would interpret this chapter into drawing format and initially I thought they will do it in grand amazing and wow art like in other manhwas when the MC achieve something big but they use emotional approach instead and while it can be a lil bit underwhelming for me it just fits well in this chapter context especially when you already know what this chapter really is about and its implications it made this chapter 999 times more sadder I fast passed all the way here and I dont regret it one bit when the constellations shared burden of plausibility with dokja I almost shed a tear  that was so goood I cant wait to see see the art with the story its such a good story and just keeps getting better This episode was awesome truly deserving the name of a fable The last two chapters gave me chills Absolutely stunning I am in awe This is such a fantastic story I cant wait for the rest üòç This episode was amazing I got chills I have school in like 5 hours  spent probably 30 coins I have no regrets but Id have to wait longer for new chapters  YESS IT IS YOUR STORY LET THEM KNOW DOKJA  literally got chills when reading a new fable was created been such a long time since a story could get such a reaction from me well done author and artist and translater  Im obessed with this I love it  Everything in this chapter was priceless and utterly awesome long live to the King of the kingless world  ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú® Wow our eyes are on you too Dokja Share with us the story you so desperately wish to tell SO FUCKING BADASS Kim Dokja destroyed the Absolute Throne with the same energy as Drogon melting the Iron Throne in GoT he almost got me in the first half not gonna lie i really thought dokja was gonna die for a second there the constellations are so nice  Im on the edge of my seat like holy cow üò≠üò≠Why is this not a anime already  Im really tired of the top comments being people complaining about the translation i am bankrupt and selling my children for this webtoon i hope this isnt the end Constellations Why take the hard road when theres an easier oneDokja Hey wait Im not dead yet my mans really said if you can‚Äôt beat them join them and became a fable Was it just me or this was a REALLY GOOD chapter I have bought almost every single episode that was come out this story is just too good almost cried bruh GAHHHD DAMN ü•µ favorite chapter so far  this should seriously get an anime adaptation but idk how id handle waiting for each season THIS IS TOO GOOD The Constellation Unproductive Reader is looking at Incarnation Kim Dokja dang do yall see that azzüòç He has a big ass SHIII this is SO GOOD not usually one for action fantasy stories but holy balls this gave me so much goosebumps Its been so long since Ive found a good story that makes want to binge read or continue reading no matter what Im doing OOOOOOOOOHOOOOO AGORA SIM AS COISAS COME√áAM A FICAR S√âRIAS  This chapter is my favorite that I‚Äôve read so far just because of how the constellations share his pain of plausibility It‚Äôs just this moment when they seems to regain their humanity and and really using him as a driving force to win this game once and for all  WOW I am speechless Im pretty sure that its suppose to be King of a Kingless World one of my fav episode 3 i almost cried when the constellations shared his burden TT damn this feels like a cinematic masterpiece is this chapter a joke like its too amazing to be true king of a kingless world this chapter was so good my heart just went üìàüìâüìà when the constellations were sharing the burden I GOT A PHYSICS EXAM TOMORROW AT 7AM AND ITS ALREADY 4AM TF üíÄüíÄüíÄ PRAY FOR ME This is only the beggining Buckle up folks  The constellations warned him clear enough you will die because of it but kdj answered thats my decision to make I like how fearless kdj is but at the same time I despise him for betting on his life so easily because the people around him surely fear his death And me too You should value your life more kdj OH MY GOD DOKJA The attention to detail Water droplets on the title page üíãüëåüèæ Can someone explain to me what had happened So the world ended but he is born again I‚Äôm very confused this has to be my favorite episode so far Whered secretive plotter go that constellation is usually the most active one  you insignificant worm üòë Well you petty defected teddybear dont you dare say that to Dokja Am I crying YES I AM CRYING THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL a new fable was created for him üò≠üò≠üò≠ I stg Iam falling too hard for this man üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ This was beautiful ü§ç I like how the top comments were critiques in the grammar and not about how much more emotionally deep and thought provoking this Episode was Yes I‚Äôm sure they also believed that it was deep but still no need to point out things that aren‚Äôt that significant when it still gives off the same feel if it was translated slightly different Bro This Episode was absolute fire Personally I dont really see why people have a problem with the text It still means the same thing üòï this chapter tho üòôüëå This episode is so good  Man my heart is literally racing in excitement  This is this is incredible hes so attractive at the end goosebumps dokja i love u HOLYYYYYYYYYY This was so beautiful I want to cry  WOAH ohhh Also this would be the perfect moment to end the season but they still moved on mmmmm damn damn this chapter when i first read it gave me chills running through my whole body cuz of how good it was  I deffinetly feel the Dokabies will realise eventually how Dojka is able to know what he is doing and has the knowledge of what could be happening in the future   I have no idea what‚Äôs happening but that was cool lol bruh the last panel are just my tears dropping down the screen  honestly I thought that he was gonna use his king attribute after it killed him and get back up for a small comedic moment alternatively this feels a little power of friendshipish but at the very least It makes some sense ‚ÄúKing of a kingless world‚Äù has a better ring and it‚Äôs shorter which emphasizes the irony The king of a kingless world sounds way better ‚ÄúBald Army General‚Äù this chapter was badass and cool to see comstellations help Dokja dokja Bro this is literally the coolest comic of ALL TIME GOD THAT STAR SCENE WAS AMAZING I need to read this episode again everything was too good ‡≤•‡≤• The king of the

has such an amazing translation This gave me freaking shivers man üòñ‚ù§Ô∏è so Dokja became a fable and therefore sort of like a constellation   by the way i thught taht the other country had a throne too why this make it sound like it is only in koreaedit to answer yes i know that but if the other have a throne too whats the use of removing one the outer god will still be connected to the planet i red the book too but i never got that part I don‚Äôt get why the final panel is upside down tho WTF MAN THAT WAS THE MOST WHOLESOME THING EVER W THE CONSTELLATIONS IMMA CRY‡ºé‡∫∂‚Äø‡ºé‡∫∂

üò≠üò≠‚úãdammn i love this webtoon so much üíï Everything that hes doing Everything he believes and fights for I think Dokja will become a Constellation in his own right This is amazing beyond words bro I legit got goosebumps at the ending  Give me shivers man  we know who is the constellations favoriteüòÅ idky but i got a bit emo here he must have been really passionate about this story when he was reading it he really changed it to how he would have wanted it  Dokja created a new Fable does this mean that he now transcends higher than a normal humans with lower constellations Well maybe Im wrong cause being an origin of a fable doesnt make one its main protagonistBut we all know that hes the main protagonist of this story anyway so No words Just Wow Youd think this would be part of a finale but theres still more  Swag Daaaamn i got goosebumps now that was a solid conclusion  This webtoon never ceases to amaze me it‚Äôs just godly King of a Kingless World Aaaa  Here me out Read this episode with music I hold you by Clann Hits different Especially the ending damn this ep grabbed me by the neck and threw me against a wall My heart is beating so fast how can I wait

sounded so much cooler though  this episode is so amazing ü•≤ This Constellation falls more in love with the story as it continues Infinite pride and affection overwhelms us Is Dokja going to die I dont know why but I felt like tapering up when constellations started to look upon Dokja  DOKJA IS A LEGEND WBK you did well dokja HOLY‚Äì IS DOKJA A FABLE NOW üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•I AM IN LOVE  Hol up remember yall how Constellations are ranked from Historic then Rare Mythical and the Ultra Rare Fables Dokja just became the newest Fable‚ÄùThe King of the World Without a King‚Äù I remember the other chapter where a constellation wanted him to promise that when he got to pick a constellation next to pick him WELL how about now Dokja IS the newest Constellation and a FABLE at that too I wonder what his powers will be too The constellation Giver of chocolate chipped circles stares down at the new fable created A cookie is sponsored as a bonus This here is one of my most favored moments in the Novell Can someone please explain what the burden of plausibility is  oh my gosh this is so interesting Is this only half of the story I don‚Äôt want it to end yet üò≠ This sht is as good as a movie my god AHHHHHHH My heart is pounding OUT of my chestüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ THIS IS EPICCCC Cant wait for next episode his first fable ü•∫ is this where theyre gonna teleport to diff locations now Well that was something And it was something AWESOME  hm would love a bunch of constellations to share some of my burdensüò≠ my god this is so badass The king of a world without a king immeditially made me think of Viva La Viva song for some reason A twist I didnt see coming and a fantastic wrap to this story arc Beautiful that‚Äôs all I have to say WHOA WHOA WHOAAAAAAAA The plot and everything overall is just Chefs kiss  the last panel was fabulous but i also loved that the title looked like some rain drops had fallen on it OMG WHAT A GREAT CHAPTER  He cant die tho Wow the constellations shared the burden with him Amazing Team with Crunchyroll and make this an anime already That was so fucking cool I got goosebumps dang mind blown  So he just died‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ahh the last panel hes so hot omg You are special You are loved  epic Ah sunfish is deciding not to regress King of the World without King is good but I still hope that they keep the original King of the Kingless World naw what is up with these translations bring back king of  a kingless world üò≠üò≠ it sounds so much more epic Cam just talk about how Dokja now has two constellation class weapon with the new onefour yin demon decapitated being able to serve the link between  a constellation that‚Äôs just overpower and now Dokja has it I hope others survive is all I‚Äôm saying After reading this chapter I remember a certain quote in the back of my mind Dokja destroying the throne and Constellations watching has made him leave a strong legacy in changing everything Their world their fate and their future It is this quote that became the representation of what Dokja stand for so that people will not lose hope in their darkest hour This is Dokja‚Äôs legacy ‚ÄúThis is where your story begins‚Äù Will Dokja end up becoming a constellation himself The constellations gave him a title and even a fable about Dokja was created it seems he might atleast achieve something similar to a constellations level of power even if he doesnt become a constellation That was fantastic great job WTF why am i crying while the constelations look ay dokja screw this i love this story Idk but Kim Dokja looks oddly beautiful in the last panel üò≥üò≥ wait so dat man is a fable now this story just keeps on climbing and I am loving it Huh none of the usual constellations were helpingUriel Son Wu Kong ect You beautiful bitch Omg is Dokja gonna become a constellation  I I almost thought Dokja will become a constellation Y‚Äôknow that Kim Dokja will always take the hard routes Easy ain‚Äôt always the best  Damn it felt legendarily cool and satisfying No Dokja is not a constellation now Incarnations can achieve fables from my understanding with enough fables achieved and certain conditions met an incarnation can become a constellation maybe wait  I think the constellations who were giving him coins did not join in üò£ i really like the details such as the end title being covered in raindrops

never have I ever seen a character be so damn OP while not having any physical buffsif the country were to abandon democracy Id want to be in his kingdom this is why i feel in love with this webtoon I read the LN because the webtoon only had 10 chapters at the time and this is one of if not the best chapters with this series theres a few more noticable chapters as well but this really was the best for me im so glad webtoon has done the novel justice he sure looks more like a protagonist than the protagonist himself  this mf still think hes not a main character someone needs to fix his self eestem bc though it doesnt seem fucked up how can a guy be so blind about his own awesomeness Cant believe that I just cried because of how epic that was TOP TIER EPISODE  Well dang tht was beautiful and touching ü•∫ my eyes are sparkling with tears‚Ä¶ this was a beautiful episode ‚Äô also can someone PLEASE get this man some clothes  OMG THE POSE THE KIMONO THE FACIAL EXPRESSION So alluring üò≠ Hes kinda caked up tho üëÄüëÄ King of a Kingless World‚Ä¶ this was one of my favorite parts and gave me chills when reading the novel  I got shivers from this chapter oh my god I like how the title has become stained with rain Authors who use their own logo to great advantage are usually the most creative wowthis story is amazing The word plausibility has come up multiple times and I‚Äôve searched up the meaning but I still don‚Äôt get it in the context of the story someone plz explain it to me epic gosh this is why i love this manhwa üíÉ I cant believe Im crying over this not the constellations taking the pain onto themselves in order to help himüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ I literally cried out loud for a couple of seconds because this was so wholesomesadcute man I dont even know Beautiful masterpieceü•∫ the last panel of dokjaso beautiful  hes so cool wtf  woahhhhhh this was a great chapter I‚Äôm a little confused does this mean that when he dies he‚Äôll be a fable

shared the burden with him goosebumps cant believe that this is only just the beginning and theres so much more to this story i really need to catch up with the novel dokja also looked so pretty in the last panel  god the last panel made me speechless Love how the author drew that expression on dokjas face if dokja died will he be a constellation Okay can someone explain to me what plausibility is and what fables are in this story dhdjjdd man just became a constellation with his new found title are constellations calling him an equal bro i have goosebumps someone told me dokja will be gone üò≠ i hope its not Dokja you monster You did it You are the King of the Kingless World awestruck Ive come this far Im this webtoon but I still dont understand a thing but I still love to read it crying shitting throwing up kdj is so pretty bruh that last thing Dokja said about him not regressing and stuff brought tears and idk whyyy Amazing It‚Äôs 211 am and I had to contain my screaming so nobody wakes up Wow I think I kind of get it damn i wouldve cried  can someone explain to me plausibility and what dokja meant by that he tried his best to make things seem probable Well everything is fine but my instincts say that blondish girl from Dokjas officeSangah is dangerous or is hiding something  King of the world without a king yup thats Dokja alright soif he started a new fable doesnt that mean after he dies he could become a constellation Tis nothing but a scratch this will be my favorite chapter  tbh I like King of a World without a King over the other translation better symmetry Its so beautiful The constellation are simps of Dokja D I want a drama of this line by line with every tiny details with the greatest special effects that exists in the whole world „ÉòÔΩ•ÔΩ•„Éò‚î≥‚îÅ‚î≥ ‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª f2 Literal chills from this episode Beautifully done change it to king of a kingless world and say outer gods Chillsss I GOT CHILLS That last

this episode is awesome DUDE IT JUST STARTED POURING AT MY HOUSE THIS IS CRAZY THAT WAS A SUPER GOOD EPISODE Its lit üëå still waiting for 68 But I think that the author wrote TWSA so that Dokja would see how the world would be like without him or to warn him about the new world and to be there saviour every time these cliffhangers are too much every time  All The Constellations Someone are looking at You Dokja Man this is ust epic omggg wait what CONSTELLATION EMPRESS SAMIRAH IS LOOKING AT YOU NOOOOO I NEED MORE  The Constellation ENIGMA Is Looking At You unbound by the text before him the reader transcends the narrative to write a new one in the pages Not going to lie I teared up for this chapter  and to think I only started this series two days ago and binged it all woah goosebumps You can add the star to start It could just be typo or a misspelling but it was a crucial word to get wrong and might confuse the readers  Um so senpai notice me THE KING OF THE WORLD WITHOUT A KING What a beautiful plot Brace yourselves up folks this story and their titles are going to get much more chuunibyou from here on Iis he a constellation now omg that is so awseone

the art in this chapter is so amazing  sometimes I feel like I need to reread this webtoon all over again bcause it can get confusing but even without understandingremembering every concept or knowing that I dont quite get the importance of a new fable I FELT each moment of this chapter Im so amazed  Aw Dokja going CRAZY Amazing chapter this story is enthralling That was an awesome chapter Wow thats amazing JCJFJJXJDNE omg wahhhh I died at how gud dis is DOKJA LEGEND  Wow I have been hooked to this but wow‚Ä¶It got even better  This is EPIC this story keeps getting better üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è I like this story a lot but I think it illustrates the concept in Eastern culture that I would call secret knowledgeYou know like in many Japanese games you would profit a lot from knowing smth from guides outside of the game Or if youre playing it a second time And like that in this scenario there was nothing from which you couldve come to conclusion that the throne is so dangerous It was totally indeductible from prior knowledge  I want to know what does the author usually mean by constellations As sometimes even the stars are mentioned as a constellation like in this chapter At this pint there‚Äôs on right for Junghyeok yu to be the hero of TWSA he always sleeping  find everything is ready Dojka is working so hard  I want to fight ü§∫ any one saying he‚Äôs not hot he is so handsome and cute sometimes Chills man THANKS AUTHOR  IM SO EXCITED FOR THE NEXT CHAPS  Im sorry but Im literally flipping out at how cool this chapter wasLIKE DAMNNNN That was incredible üò≠ üëè ü•≤ Youre a Constellation Harry  Huh I mean Dokja man i thought this comic was gonna end So cool ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú® Oh wow that is awesome The king of the world without a king Thats a nice title to it Lets get ready for PART 2 wowwwwwe this week episode is so hypppeeee Damn that was‚Ä¶ beautiful BRO CHILLSSS Wow‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt even realize I was holding my breath throughout the whole chapter till now I am in so much awe  damn that was beautiful  dokkaebi principal thought he can fail Dokja in test But fortunately hes indirectly sponsored by benefactors like constellations Also Lord of dark dimension Dormammu wishes not to mess with KDJ  Wow this chapter gave me so much goosebumps so good This story seems to just get better and better Next week can‚Äôt come soon enough That was pretty friggin metal I Flipping Love this story  Fucking what  My jaw is on the floor How does this story just keep getting better every episode yes you get the right feeling about this its something Very big KD sure is a King nice Title RIP King of a Kingless World This chapter was pretty much a grand movie ending I love this comic Can‚Äôt wait to read more  omg i just noticed that this is barely chp 15 isnt the novel like 500 üò≥ very tempted to read it  ‚ÄúThree Ways To Survive The Apocalypse‚Äù could this be one of the ways Could the title actually indicate the web novel was meant to serve as a guide to actually ending the apocalypse ‚ÄúDo these three specific but insanely hard tasks and the world will not end‚Äù This was one of the most satisfying episodes so far its like the ending or not quite ending of a movie when the good guys win i thoroughly enjoyed it Damn that last panel gave me goosebumps  could everyone see the Golden screen at the end or only mc Holy shit üî•üî•üî• Omg OMG  Wheres Paimon Now he has a fable the other constellations are gonna be trying to sponsor him so hard lol i genuinely believe this is my favorite chapter so far The EPICNESS üî•‚ú®üååüëåüèª Ohhh This Was So POWERFUL üî•üî•üî•üî•My emotions are a mess ü§Ø internally screaming  So since he‚Äôs a fable that means in order for his story to be a legit there can be no regressions bc everyone in the story is supposed to only live once to make it a whole and true story Will he become a constellation then when he dies  Damnit it seems it‚Äôs finally time for me read the LN I need to understand what this means  Holy HELL that was EPIC  The translation is killing me but I hope it gets to improve in later chapters tho look at dokja at the last panel hes such a beautiful man THAT WAS SO COOL WTH AAAAAAAAA KING SHIT every week i come here and internally scream my head off about how cool dokja is that one time a fanmade story is more interesting than the real ones  I absolutely love how the main character has planned everything and the payoff of just watching the main character carry out the plan is amazing Kudos to the people who made this you did amazing dude sorry Im so stupid but what do they mean bythe burden of plausibility  could someone explain please  This was AWESOME üëè üëè  does this mean his story was becoming a fable üòÆ GIVMME THE NEXT EPISODE IM OBCESSED WITH THIS BUT IM BROKE  That was touching ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ Holy shit The writing and art continues to amaze me Praise those Constellations Lots of things he did change the storyline but this this right here change everything He literally change the gameplan dokkaebi has plan out Wow The king of the world without a king So impressive  This webtoon never has any lows wow this episode was not only beautiful artistically but also had a cool story  with the constellations sharing his plausibility and stuff dont you hate it when you try imagining how your body being shredded apart feels like but then you start throwing up Came back for a reread Wait‚Ä¶is he a king now   That‚Äôs awesome   currently reading Ch 464 of the Novel its so incredible üò©  YOOOOOO THIS IS SICK EVERY EPISODE MAKES MY HEART EXITED BRO I MIGHT GET A DISEASE King of a kingless world Dojka u smart cookie u question for those that have read the ink and paper are we nearing the end of the story or is this like the end of the beginning No Gods or Kings only men i dont know what to expect thats what this webtoon does to me dokja i am the master of my own fate no matter the outcome HYPE Goosebumps Constellations  be like üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è nirvanamoebius god dokja  big dipper Ive come to bargain that last panel absolutely gorgeous ‚ù§ Ddid Did he just become a constellation the constilation if the big diaper is my favorite constilation irl i look at it every night  HOLY FREAKING CRAP THIS CHAPTER 1000000000010 rating the was great  aaaa dokja finally got his first great fable Ok but the water droplets on the name So the reason Dokja destroyed the throne is that if he sits on it this world ends So only the one who sat on it will go to the next regression and everyone else die except Jung hyeok since he‚Äôs the main char of the world Am i understanding this right  Man that was insane I legit thought he was gonna die I just have one word for this whole serie WOW  Ong that was so cool cant wait for the next part and king of the world without a king is cool I wonder how much coins he will get or how mad the cute thing will be WHAT JUST HAPPENED did he just become a fabled constellation Beautiful chapter Very awesome Super curious to see where the story goes now that this capture the flagget the throne scenario seems to be ending Idk what just happened but it was cool This is the second time i‚Äôve cries reading this ep is so good „Ö†„Ö† And now the true story begins Im calling it now Dokja is a constellation and the story he read was just his future self somehow This gave me CHILLS It was worth more than 5 coins thats for sure Yall when I say I screamed I literally screamed THIS EP WAS THE BEST BY FAR So in case of something theres a chance dokja can be a constellation now that hes a fable But ofc for him to succeed that cant happen its a little thought I had while readingomg Im so excited for whats coming like this is setting more new boundaries i am cryingüò≠üòµ this is mind blowing i am stunned I feel overwhelmed with the support that Dokja has recieved in the previous ep and this one too It ist just fucking amanzing what an absolute king no Im not sorry The constellations trust in Dokja is unbeatable  ooo I got chills from that This story gets better and better So amazing Definitely worth the free 5 coins and the 2 weeks wait to see the king of the kingless world bit King of a kingless world runs off the tongue better in my opinion What an amazing addictive beautiful comic So so good  They should have kept king of a kingless world

read this comic sure did sync beautifully with this scene  king of the world without a king  has a beautiful meaningin ancient time the king will be someone from the royal family they have to have the connection with the king and for this scenario Dokja would be a king if he had the throne of a different king but he didnt want to get that which is tied with another king nHe wanted to tell that he will be someone who can fulfill the dutys of a King and also can gain the respect of other kings without the help of another king nüçÅüçÅüçÅüçÅ WAIT DID HE LIKE UHM BECAME A CONSTELLATION OR SOMETHING dokjaaaa wow AMAZING üëèüëèüëè I feel like he might come back because when he destroyed the throne now everyone has a chance to actually defeat the next one and in a way he saved them all by doing that and he can come back because he save ppl right üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è what a chapter ¬∞¬∞ wow the constellations can do that ¬∞‚ó°¬∞ yeah they already did so why ask haha‚ùÅ¬¥‚ñΩ‚ùÅ‚ú≤Ôæü

novel i cried so much before continuing itthe next chpg hahah TvTand now i see this scene it pained meüò≠üò≠ aurghghhhgh i cant Goosebumps The beginning of next chapter Would have been better if they use a better title like The Uncrowned King just my opinion though That was so satisfying that I had to give a minute of silence and just think about it THIS CHAPTER WAS SO EPIC  DOKJA A LEGEND This chapter was so awesome and so heart warming at the same time Chills Goosebumps üåå dokja you fucking legend damn‚Ä¶ i cried again Im confused did he just become a fable himself when you do something that breaks the word YOOOOOOO The Constellations sharing of his burden actually broke me Day 66 of voicing all the characters aaaaand hes starting to make his own story his own constellation ÔΩ°‚ô°‚Äø‚ô°ÔΩ°‚óè‚ô°‚àÄ‚ô° I respect his character Sometimes the protagonist who is said to be the protagonist need not be the one Kim Dokja youre such a main character and I love you bro tht gave me chills wooooo damn idk about you but this is my most favorite novel  webtoon and I freaking need a physical book English version for this  kudos to the constellations I wonder what would happen if Junyeok could also see Dokja‚Äòs point of view everytime he gets beaten unconscious Unlikely to happen cause he doesn‚Äòt has the matching skill but still just wondering I think I might start reading this WebtoonIll think about it though üò© my favorite chapter so far the true story will begin here i absolutely love this everything is amazing The constellations helped him Im cryingüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ just wow its overwhelming holy crap it‚Äôs raining rn and wow that‚Äôs really setting the mood omfg this guy is so pretty ion know what everyone else is talking abt üò≠ wait what did plausible mean again as someone with English as the third language this webtoon sure has got me pick up a dictionary for words like regression incarnation etc etc ü•∫ i havent felt so much joy from seeing a character get help in a long time thank you okay cool sad shit and cool awesome story shit but why is not one talking about that dumby üòçüòç dang I wish I could screen shot king

awhile üòî  I freaking love this chapter My favorite so far OH NO Awesomeüíõ Jesus loves you  The world without king is more better everyone is free like japanesebut some county maybe destroy because of it epicccccccc love this development PLSSSS change the translation back to King of a Kingless World it sounds so much better LITERALLY GOT CHILLS So now he‚Äôs his own constellation King of a abandoned world so touchingIm rooting for you too üò≠üò≠üí™üèºüí™üèº This is amazing  gahhhhhgg I love it what is the burden of plausibility I didnt see an explanation and it dont make sense to me from context why did he almost die WAIT I DONT UNDERSTANDüò≠ why would they create a new story my brain is malfunctioning brava what a beautifully written succinct wrap to this plot well done keep up the good worküñ§ how did he know that so does that mean that he would be the last person to die in this regression Reading this chapter with God Shattering Star playing in the background was an awesome experience So proud of my man Dokjaü§ó that was amazing  I dont understand the plausibility probability thing Hooo I KNEW IT I FACKIN KNEW IT mainly because i was imagining an OC because im not onetrack minded anyways i pretty much guessed this OH MY GOODNESS Constellation Constant Thinking Ocean did a spit take in shock did did Dokja just earn his Constellation title omfg fav chapter so far The constellation Crown of Applpi is looking at Kim Dojka oh man OO I dont understand the plausibility thing but I do love this comic  I‚Äôm not even sure what‚Äôs happening in the story anymore selfharm colorless by nekobolo and catharsis by aether was such good songs to listen to while reading this chapter That was amazing 00 √ë estaba tan bueno el anterior que me pase este con diccionario en mano they shouldve just stayed with king of kingless world because that sounds so good and badass than whats written above this is so beautifulüò≠ My mans Dokja actually survived CHILLSS Well done dokja lol why did the change the name GOATED Chapter I read the whole web novel and still never understood why is it so bad for someone to sit on the throne can someone explain what is going on PLEASE nice ass üëç hj hehehheuntil he does get regression and then he repeats it with  The mc of twsa I just realized that I cant spell his name but Im too lazy to go check it Im probably getting ahead of myself tho  Dokjaaaa üå± How about if the fable would be called Uncrowned king of the world or Worlds uncrowned king ü§î Wait he said he won‚Äôt need a next regression maybe Sonja has lived three this in the form of how ever many regressions and he‚Äôs finally gotten this ending the ending he wanted and the outcome he wanted idk if this is possible but my brain had a light bulb moment The King of the World without a King üëëSink af Isnt the blade supposed to brake after the  the throne does But technically he is a king so its not literally a kingless world right If you are confused the translation is a bit shaky King of the world Without a king would basically mean Throneless king  I dont know man it seems off to me but besides that this chapter was heat BRUHHH THE CHANGED TRANSLATIONS ERK ME SO NMUCHHDH That was beautiful Seeing all the constellations he ever touched somehow help him out but did he like become a constellation cause fables are the people behind the constellation right im not sure tho sheeeeesh OKAY I SUSPECTED HE WAS AT S POINT THIS COULD HAPPEN BUT IM STILL SUPER JAZZED AMD SUPRUSED ABT IT YESSS Dokja  LES LES LES LES LES

Fabled constellation that was his plan all along or he just wanted to cut the tie between the outer gods and this world to give it a better ending than TWSAs hmm Id prefer it if they actually translated the names of each of the stars of the big dipper Like the seven stars are actually called Alioth Dubhe Merak Phecda Megrez Mizar and Alkaid But they also apparently have titles because theyre dieties in korean folklore collectively called Chilseong That was beautiful man  This episode was just simply so beautiful Woooo The boy got his first Fable üëèüëèüëè This novel reader is excited to see the next chapters the art is gorgeous especially that last panel of Dokja ‚ô° truly a wonder tuesday I started cackling like a madman about halfway through this chapter and didn‚Äôt

Reader was the first novel I started Words cannot describe the enjoyment I have got throughout this thrilling adventure Thank you so much for creating this I will forever give you all the coins this right here ladies and gentlemen is the beginning of something great I can feel it „ÄåThe constellation NEPTUNES is so proud of Dokja for his wits and choosing not to stray the path of a true king„Äç Thus a new Story has begun upon us and we set sail with the 7 stars of the Big Dipper let us be worthy of their help in fending of these countless foes 5 coins for Gryffindor‚Ä¶ jkjk I mean Dokja JUST SAY KING OF A KINGLESS WORLD HOW HARD IS THAT would be nice to change to king of a kingless world it sounds way better Am I the only one who is feeling really confused by the mistranslation corrections at this pointüòÖ come on constellations an goat man give our guy all the rewards  he deserves  for being dope asf to turn down power an a kingship is a mighty sacrifice at 5he very least upgrade his skills or let him pick the constellation  he wants that he mentioned long ago be his supporter Wait‚Ä¶ where is Lazy broke weeb ‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt go too broke to read right üò≠üò≠üò≠ The constellation Foolish Husband of the Sun is hopeful this means a new constellation be born 5 coins have been sponsored Dojkawow dude A man with no constellation has gotten so much from them they dont want his story to end just yet There was some big foreshadowing in this chapter probably for things we wont see for dozens of scenarios and hundreds of chapters but Im really excited for it either way May Death do us part‚Ä¶  huiwon and sangah so hot What is YJH going to think when he awakens again Holy sht is this the beginning of a legend The constellations sharing his pain my heart ü•∫ The translations are really‚Ä¶ Off in this webtoon version  this webtoon seriously needs to be a movie this chapter was epic and gave me goosebumps really dislike translation of some things here ofc I appreciate the work but we have Google for a reason  He said that there is no next regression for him so he would finish the story in this world so technically my theory in this is what if he just fall asleep in the train after he finished reading the story because he is too tired from work and when he finally reached the end of the story he will wake up exactly at his home destination and will continue his life because all of the happenings is just his dream God motherfucking damn our Dokja became a god damn constellation and a fabled one at that Is it just me or does this chapter feel way shorter than the others You have achieve the non existing achievement Me in my studies DamnDokja has broken every possible 4th wall and created his ownnAhhhhhhhhhh is itreally coming to an end king of the world without a throne sounds more better no when u just wanted to screenshot but u cant lmao  The constellation Stormy Ram King dropped his bowl of oatmeal in shock   500 coins has been promoted  That feeling when you choose not to have a supporting constellation so that you can become a constellation dokja my meowmeow my beloved Great idea Who needs a king üéµ No king no king lalalalalaüéµ Im not sorry xD bsksbskbd his ass is so lovingly rendered just like Eminem said Make me king as we move towards a new world order you guys know the rest  But seriously that last panel has my heart feeling a certain type of way üò≠üò≠ YOOO WAIT THATS WILD YOOOO help i cant pretend i understand with mere force of will anymore what does the rule of plausibility MEANS Just wow thank you  whoa I love this story and the art so much each episode is such a pleasant surprise This feels surprisinglyless triumphant than the story made it in my head when reading it I kinda like the mood change Your boy Dokja just hit the Ultimate Combat move So Dokja has become a Story not just the reader Glad to see him be put in the rightful place Rip king of a kingless world It was a much better name for the story compared to this  I got such a big shiver from this The author and artist are working so well together Im kind of lost on what this means going forward Holy sht that was beautiful A new Fable has been created ‚ÄúA King in a World without a King‚Äù The constellations look down at Dokja with a newfound respect Hundreds of coins are being sponsored wow just wow DOKJA just spent 72000 coins just to smack the hell out of Yu I cant this guyüòÇ Haha take that little girl What do you say now about Dokja not being handsome hmmm Thats what I thoughtsmug What will happen after

       "'Im not sure I like the translation of Dokjas fable here sure King of the World without a King is technically correct but King of a Kingless World sounds better Its easier to say at least The

looking at you Nobody can tell me this chapter wasn‚Äôt a movie I just watched in IMAX The constellations taking the burden from dokja was awesome it‚Äôs just letting you know even the constellations are much more interested in an alternate fable The fact that he didn‚Äôt expect the constellations to share the burden and the fact they did is so cool and heart warming Am I the only one who got literal chills when the constellations all teamed up to share the burden I would love to play a game where an achievement popped with youve done something so rad and unheard of that we created this specifically because of you Dokja has achieved more in one regression than Junyeok did in like 80 I sponsor this episode to share the burden of financial stress with the Author 5 Coins Spent The fable the king of the World without a King has been created Guys its his FIRST FABLE Im getting emotional ü•∫ü•∫ This is the beginning Super excited for the future chapter 5 coins has been sponsored KING OF A KINGLESS WORLD This would make such an amazing anime Which constellation do I have to pay to make that happen God I love this story So many twist and turns yet so well written 1010 Hes not the protagonist we were promised but hes the one we got All Hail the King of the Kingless This webtoon is so visually stunning that I just cant Like the way those speech bubbles overlapped to show that the constellations speak simultaneously Wow As each constellation looked at him to share his burden it made me tear up a little Dokja making friends everywhere CHILLS LITERAL CHILLS WORTH EVERY CENT The Constellation LADY OF THE SINGULAR FOOTWEAR is stunned into awed silence 5 coins have been gifted I really enjoy seeing dokaebis get mad I literally cannot throw money at my screen hard enough for this title If you didnt get goosebumps did you even read the chapter ‚úãü§® By far one of the best webtoons on this app Theres a thousand titles that Dokja could have and all of them are badass But King of the Kingless World is better than all of them The Constellation Lord of the Bleeding Wallet is looking at the author5 coins have been sponsored Oh my God this chapter just gave me chillsthat panel with Dokja under the rain is incredible this series keeps getting better and better So he just became his own constellation The Constellation Lonesome Dragon believes King of a Kingless world

GOD FOR BEING THE FIRST CONSTELLATION TO SHARE KDJS PROBABILITY The declaration of Dokjas fable in gold was so great I was scared for the translation of the fable and even though it is a bit of a mouthful compared to King of a Kingless World Im fine with it If anyone was wondering plausibility is the chance of something happening since destroying the throne by borrowing the constellations powers has never been achieved before and is not plausible to a point Dokja suffers adverse effects Sorry if its still not clear i dont know man king of a kingless world rolls off the tongue more

üò•ü§ó all along he wanted to save his friends from becoming characters remain human POWERFUL WORDS Now they begin their own path üòÑ Out of all of Omniscient Reader the first Fable is probably my favorite and this was an amazing adaptationDefinitely think the translator should stick with King of a Kingless World rather than the current as some others have pointed outnAlso I don think it was meant to be Ruler of the Dark Dimension unless that is going to be the official TL from now on May need to clarify because that sounds pretty easily confusable with the Demons that last panel has me feeling a jumble of emotions his expression is justI dont even have a word for it I feel like I need to reread from the beginning and make a glossary as I go cuz I know something big happened with the new fable being created but I feel like my brain isnt fully grasping the magnitude of it I got emotional when they started to share the burden I‚Äôm such a big old baby üò≠ I cant explain how moving it was to see Dokja risk his life to show the constellations a new and better story I couldnt say I would be willing to do the same Be more like Dokja The there is NO NEXT REGRESSION for me in this world really open your eyes that they wont have 2nd chance in life once their luck runs out I know this is based on a novel so I really wanna go read it right now assuming theres a translated version out there but at the same time I know myself well enough to say that theres a 99 chance that Ill never return to this Webtoon if I do because my brain gets bored with repeating stories and I really REALLY wanna keep supporting this Webtoon Wait‚Äîso has our boi gone from reader to author This was so epic The constellations coming together to help him his speech about using the descendants for power Everyone banding together and trusting him Just dang I wasnt expecting all of this So good üî•üî•üî• king of the world without a king is such a mouthful tbh I wasnt sure about Dokja as a protagonist because it felt like everything he was doing no matter how good it seemed was ultimately selfserving Now we see what his real end goal was not to survive but to make sure the world makes it through Thats a hero worth believing in BIG SHOUTOUT TO YI SUNSIN MARITIME WAR GOD FOR BEING THE FIRST CONSTELLATION TO SHARE KDJS PROBABILITY The declaration of Dokjas fable in gold was so great I

really wanna go read it right now assuming theres a translated version out there but at the same time I know myself well enough to say that theres a 99 chance that Ill never return to this Webtoon if I do because my brain gets bored with repeating stories and I really REALLY wanna keep supporting this Webtoon Wait‚Äîso has our boi gone from reader to author This was so epic The constellations coming together to help him his speech about using the descendants for power Everyone banding together and trusting him Just dang I wasnt expecting all of this So good üî•üî•üî• king of the world without a king is such a mouthful tbh I wasnt sure about Dokja as a protagonist because it felt like everything he was doing no matter how good it seemed was ultimately selfserving Now we see what his real end goal was not to survive but to make sure the world makes it through Thats a hero worth believing in Im gonna explain few things based on this webtoon version of translation so new readers wont be too confused do correct me if Im wrongConstellations known to have 3 levels highest is Mythical means Mythgrade next is Fabled means Fablegrade last is Historical Historygrade Term Fable used in this chapter is not referring to Constellations grade but the essence of someones power in ORV When ones achievement is significant and recognised by Star Stream they earn a Fable DOKJA YOUVE ALWAYS BEEN A KING IN MY EYES ü•∫ü•∞üíï Ok So fables were called stories in the novel Earning a fable does not equate becoming a fable constellation All constellation have accumulated fables and incarnations can accumulate fables as well The accumulated fables make up the constellations power in their case and thats why their ranked usually by how wellknown their fables are I saw a few people getting confused over this I dont have the biggest issue with the translation change but its starting to cause confusion did this seem short I know it wasnt short but it seemed shortam I just being greedy I want morehere are my 5 ü™ôI will pay more üò≠ The last panel is so beautiful You can see the pain on his face but his determination is strong So we all agree that King of a Kingless World sounds so much better and that‚Äôs the translation we‚Äôll be using right I BLESS EVERYONE THAT ARE INVOLVE IN THIS WEBTOON TO HAVE CLEAR SKIN GOOD MEALS AND MAY ODDS BE IN THEIR FAVOR AT THE END OF THE DAY THANK YOU FOR THIS MASTERPIECE And so the story begins This feels like the prologue Now I am excited to see how each character develops their abilities new constellations to be introduced and the wonderful new items Thank you for this great adventure üíô who else had Goosebumps when the constellations started looking down on him King of a Kingless World just hits different why does the novel names and fan translated always hit better üò© Wow I got goosebumps Thank you for this having not read the book i am LOSING my shit here I appreciate the people correcting the translations but sometimes I just want to go to the comments and talk about how cool the chapter was Most of the time I dont even care about the misstransaltions Round of applause for this episode üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè Goddamn that was amazing This episode was REVOLUTIONARY THANK YOU AUTHOR D If he becomes important enough could he become a constellation The writing the story telling the climax and the ending of this one episode is just utterly outstanding Chills just chills Its so beautifully written and Im not going to miss a single bit of this because its amazing i got rising chills as more constellations looked at him god i love this webtoon chills literal chills from this chapter King of the Kingless World you have achieved a nonexistant achievement Yeah that sounds plausible I was mesmerized by the way they stacked the speech bubbles to indicate there are multiple voices but damn I didnt expect that emotional scene at all got me teared up with the togetherness trope lmao Im weak with that trope But seriously how dokja can think of anything so clearly every time is a bit too OP lol I dont think I could react like him even if I got isekaid to my favorite mmorpg that Ive played for 8 years Surely Id make a lot of blunders and doubting myself lol MY HEART Please I wish everyone who has Webtoon reads this It deserves every single adaptation known to mankind for being so fcking amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Man this series Rocks I legit started to tear up when the constellations saved him The GUY just unlocked A HIFDEN ACHIVMENT Damn what a good chapter I love the subtle change of the raindrops on the titlelogo I know translating webtoon is hard so thank you for your effort despite the barrage of criticism but Id hoped the translators take care with the research and the phrasing more Ive noticed several times that some choice of translations removed a good chunk of foreshadowings it makes me sad what kind of anime finale heartstrings pulling shit is this how DARE you make me emotional A feat so great that you are awarded an achievement that doesn‚Äôt exist That‚Äôs beyond true gaming Although the webtoons translation is okay theres so much mistranslation and better words they couldve used King of a World without a King is one big missed opportunity to just put King of a Kingless World as it sounds better Idk about the other translations but I hope webtoon could hear out the readers and use the rightbetter translation I‚Äôm not crying your crying man Binyeongs streaming channel must be soaring through the roof i wanna see his reaction As strong as this chapter is there are some things it can be improved on translation wise Like King of a world without a king would have sounded better as King of a Kingless World because during the last 5 players involved yeah they were kings but are they still after losing since there is only supposed to be one King in the end to take the throne but he destroyed it So the other kings wouldnt be kings anymore after losing if I saw how the event worked Damn Actual chills at the end there One of my favorite chapters The art was gorgeous and the pacing and paneling was done really well that was beautiful when you become the main character üò≠üò≠ wipes tear Im waiting for you in the ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ† Dokja ‚ú® I literally cried at the end its so damn good and as a novel reader who loves this story heartily the importance of this fable and the emotions I felt this chapter ahh it was soo good the only thing I didnt like is the webtoon using king of the world without a king instead of king of kingless world I feel so attached to the latter And all these starsconstellations sharing the aftermath of plausibility is heart warming I also like how his friends were so worried for him All the top comments are about translation mistakes are we not gonna acknowledge how fucking badass that was he made all the constellations so intrigued by him that they want him to live ‚úãüò≠ This arc is so beautiful The constellations are watching a show run how they‚Äôve never seen it run before They‚Äôve grown to like him and his interesting talewatching him die would bring only sorrow for them so they‚Äôre helping him live they can‚Äôt allow their show to end a show with it‚Äôs most interesting character gone is no longer as interesting or special I like other translations better ‚Äúking of a kingless world‚Äù Dokja Im going to do whats called a pro gamer moveProceeds to destroy major plot device Intern creating a brand new story why did this feel so so so uh idk how to explain but like powerful did anyone else cry when the constellations shares the plausibility no just me ok holy shit the last panel beautiful Whoever said Dokja wasnt hot is wrong SHEESH this chapter gave me literal chills Dokja is so COOLüò≠‚ù§Ô∏è The first tale of this story has been aquired Im getting goosebumps nThe fact that the webtoon art is still so stellar not only does the novel justice but brings more depth and

heart you are the King of Kingsüëë I got chills damn i actually teared up this chapter was so good Does this mean that theres a possibility of Dokja becoming a constellation I got chills seeing the

has the constellations on his side he‚Äôs unmatched fr This chapter was E P I C Can we just pause for a sec and thank the author for this This is so beautiful üò≠‚úã this chapter will have my HEART always the last panel is so beautiful istg I dont know why but this chapter had some feeling in it This was probably the coolest episode so far It makes me so excited üòÅüòé For a second I thought that Dokja was gonna become a costellation was I the only one the constollation god of üñ§shipsüñ§ is sharing the burden after being away for about a week because ofrestrictions speechless what beautiful writing some of the translations are wonky king of a kingless world is better but overall a fantastic chapter and climax to one of my fav arcs X Thank you for the story author this is just Incredible for some reason this chapter was emotionally deep loved it oo continues to eat popcorn slowly so glad Im not the only one who read the novel then went here to read the comic as well anyone else terrified to stop reading Who brought the onionsüò≠ This webtoon is amazing ‚ô•Ô∏è Got to be honest when the constellations were looking at him it felt badassgood job king of the kingless world dokja we are all here to listen to your story constellationyou will surely dieplot armor like am I a joke to you The hairs on my arms stood up while reading this So freaking good read üò≠ I waited literally all day for this It did not disappoint This is my favorite web toon The art the plot the character development all of it Just amazing Thank you author for making my day a little better ‚ù§ Author Artist and all of those that helped make this chapter a reality thank you very much love the chapter but i honestly prefer ‚Äûking of a kingless world‚Äú and ‚Äûouter gods‚Äú a lot more as possible translations King of a kingless world m imagining a Netflix series lol The storytelling of this webtoon is unmatched Each chapter tops the last They need to adapt this into an anime asap üî•üî•üî• This is why Omniscient Reader is my favorite webtoon absolutely stunning from art to story magnificent it somehow made me a lil emotional when all those screen messages of the various Constellations showed up helping him burden the plausibility dokja is pretty amazing Dont worry about the blood folks Its just internal bleeding and internal is where the blood is supposed to be anyway the art is just chefs kiss even the constellations wants to see the Dokjas story and now he has a FABLE A Kingless World ‚ú® im a novel reader but i think yall too pressed about mistranslations unless it really disrupts the plotunderstanding its not much of a big deal errwhy not just say king of a kingless world its easier and thats how they refer to it in the light novel this is one of my favourite scenes in the novel the moment when dokja made his first step towards the end the moment the concept of probability was first introduced the moment dokja became King of the kingless world the moment everything started going downhill to all that are reading this for the first time prepare yourselves because not even the Fourth wall can save you from the hardships thats gonna come in the following arcs ORV true story starts here For those who are confused what is fable think of legendarymythical heros They have their own storyfables becoming a heroic beings like Hercules going through 12 labors Odysseus trojan horse Sun Wukong starting a war against heavens It is their achievements that show their strength and spread their reputation In ORV such stories are called fables and this fable system is very important directly related to constellationincarnation‚Äôs strength Damn yall being picky with the wording Enjoy the story either way ya salty scrubs Yo Dokja is SUCH a BADDIE Literally the Constellations love him so much or at least respect him so much that they were willing to SHARE PAIN with a MERE HUMAN Dokja truly is incredible DOKJA IS SO PRETTY LOOK AT THAT LAST PANEL AHH My man just weaves out a new storyline Make your own path blaze your own trail Believe in yourself This is by far the best webcomic on webtoon in my personal opinion keep it up The art in this chapter was amazing‚Ä¶ author started out with great art style and it‚Äôs only gotten better and better with each episode Wow this gave me chills This has been an amazing series thus far but this chapter has pushed it into legendary territory Bravo author the grip dokja has on my soul That was so fucking cool i got chills when the constellations helped dokja that was so cool Got goosebumps when the constellations started to share the burden of plausibility this episode felt so cinematic i got shivers reading it Wha WHAT This is just too much I cant even find the words to say how much I love this story it just blows my mind EVERYüëè SINGLEüëè CHAPTERüëè and Im living for it Omniscent Reader is just amazing The Naval warefare god is a real one for being the first to share the burden The Bald army general probably helped as a way to pay dokja cause he dosen‚Äôt have many coins omg üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ this was so beautiful My man really knows whats what this is what makes him an awesome character Im loking at you Dokja ‚ù§ i hoped they kept the title king of the kingless world from the novel for me it sounds better Also at the end the title panel shouldve been kinda smudged or wobbly coz the artist intended for it to be that way to give it a crumpledsadlonely effect To add with the feeling of the rain and Dokjas condition at the end The artist gave a good adaptation so i just think its good to honor their efforts now it just seem like some of its wasted I hope this isn‚Äôt ending any time soon I feel like it‚Äôs only really started Its been quite some time since I was so impacted by a story A New Fable Dokjas story to tell Thanks Author Artists and all collaborators for this amazing tale The fucking GOAT i miss our initial broadcaster this one is so buthurt and angry all the time He really is such an amazing character The Gods respect him he beat the strongest man he defied the rulers of scenarios he broke the system into rewarding him with a non existent achievement he a mere human became the highest rank of constellations and most importantly he created the ending he wanted and became The King of a World Without a King Talk about a hardcore stargazer‚Ä¶ When the constellations started to share his burden you can just tell that they aren‚Äôt just in it to be entertained anymore they really want Dokja to survive because they can‚Äôt comprehend him that was quite the cinematic experience Dokja you majestic bstard üò≠ a mysterious ruler has noticed a sudden chance in this world shouldnt that be change not chance Ive completed the novel but seriously Im so emotional to see him create his first fable üò≠üò≠ King of a kingless world his first big achievement Man I straight up got chills while Im loving every single episode this one just hit me different Why cant I live more than one like üò≠ this episode brought the thrills and the feels Quite an astonishing moment I would not lie Beautiful Im just gonna leave this comment here so I can come back and remember this chapter This chapter made me emotional They shared the burden TT even though constellations are beings who treat human life like worms this was very humane for them üò¢ okay but whos still amazed by everythingITS ALL SO GOOD AND PRETTY AND SPECTACULAR these last four chapters are what made me the fan of this series SO BEAUTIFUL woah Okay but hear me out What if Dokja is the author of TWSA but he doesn‚Äôt know yet Dokja might not be the protagonist of TWSA but he sure is worthy to be the protagonist of this web comic Super epic episode omg Ah it brought me to tears how the constellations helped him üíõüíõüíõüíõüíõü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ the writing is top tier dear lord I got so many shivers from this dang this was honestly amazing to read I feel almost a part of it lol This is so beautiful üòç dude this would be so epic if it was animated king of a kingless world kim dokja üëèüëè Im speechlessDokja sacrifice the constellations helping him just a beautiful lovely chapter I remember when dokja was just s guy in the office who loved reading that book DOKJAA‚ô° THIS CHAPTER IS INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL IM ABOUT TO CRY AGAIN WITH SO MUCH HAPPINESS WITHIN ME‚ô°nTHE FEELS BRO THE FEELS‚ô° I was really trying to ignore the silly translation but thats itWTF IS THE KING OF THE WORLD WITHOUT A KING IF YOU DONT CHANGE IT RIGHT NOW IMMA SLAP SOMEONE WITH YJHngimme my King Of A Kingless World back like üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ im amazed at this fanbase people have a good eye for mistakes in the translation AND IM AMAZED AT THE END OF THIS EPISODE SKDHDLFJKD DOKJA WHAT ON EARTH JUST HAPPENED I honestly would love it more if they translated it to King of a Kingless World cause that would be more memorable Ok but the fact that Dokja is the definition of Good eveningGod has let me live another day and im making it EVERYBODYS problem Now that‚Äôs a fable I can enjoy ‚ÄúA king in a World without a King‚Äù Catchy let‚Äôs see where this King can go on his grand crusade I was gonna read the next chapter but I just had to reread this one and the chills remain intact aldjaldjsjdjd ah yes king of a kingless world the most powerful fable to have ever existed Dark Dimension Nah it sounded cooler when it referred to them as Eldritch Ooh the first probability storm Truthfully Dokja is probably the only one other than Junghyuk or Sooyung who could even survive it right now And the first Fable‚Ä¶ now this was the moment things changed Holy shit thatsIuh its amazing i am so in love with this story Woahh I am left speechless This was beautiful woohoodokjaaa soo coool WELL USE THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP The Constellations all jumping in there at the end to protect our boy was just so beautiful That was the most incredible chapter Ive ever read This story is VERY interesting I cant wait to see how the story unfolds THAT WAS DOPE So what‚Äôs his story he wanted to tell holy hell I have goose bumps this episode was so insane new fable baby Those constellations are homies for sharing the probability wow i finally catched up üòçüò≥ Doesn‚Äôt this mean Dokja is himself a constellation now Or has the potential to become one WowI love this comic in general for its world building art and story but this is the first time Dokja has seemed so heroic vs pragmatic as he was willing to risk death for the slight chance the world could be saved And the stars setting sail chills I dont really understand what just happened but Dokja is like a legend now rightü§© That was amazing Feels like a new arc will begin soonits going get even more epic isnt it if yall think this is good just you wait it gets even better This was full and completely serious Dokja Shit actually got real Im stunned by this episode What a chapter üò≠üò≠üò≠ the birth of a fable Im kinda sad they stick to fables when they already used stories before but OK ahh Im crying I love this so much Dokja YOU ACTIVATED MY TRAP CARD BALD ARMY GENERAL IM SRRYWKSKDJJD LETS GO KING Dokja became a legend in his own right this chapter The artwork was dope as always üî•üëç Wow I really love this webtoon Dokja being the King of the Kingless and what he did is really cool I cant wait to see how else he will surprise me in the future my fav manwha of all time THE LIMBS I WOULD SELL JUST TO WATCH THIS ANIMATED The constellations could have benefited from their incarnations getting the Fable But they still chose to share Dokjas pain because they support what he did üò≠ NOW THIS IS THE KIND OF WEBTOON THAT DESERVES TO BECOME A MOVIE OR A SERIES King of a Kingless World sounds way more badass ngl Goosebumps and sadness when Dokja said he only has one shot at his ending THIS IS SO GOOD MY FAVORITE STORY EVER I‚Äôm in love with every single one of these characters my heart and mind is racing This is what I want to do I‚Äôm in love with everything about this Thank you wow‚Ä¶ this story never ceases to amaze me i got tearyeyed when the constellations shared the burden and moore tearyeyed when dokja achieved something unfathomable i felt so proud favorite story on webtoon rn üõê This chapter was amazing I usually never leave comments on webtoon but this will be my first since 2 years of using webtoon This was amazing it left a great impact and I believe the story is progressing beautifully This was a BOMB chapter üëåüèæüëåüèæüëåüèæ Dokja be snatching constellations left and right A king indeed Danm The constellations certainly have a favorite XD THIS IS A MASTERPIECE Yall I couldnt wait for the updates so I read the translated comic online When I caught up to that I read the entire web novel it took me two weeks filled with endless laughter and tears Its long but written the way youd read a webtoon I highly suggest fans read the novel to get your fix PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SOMEONE ANIMATE THIS SERIES King of a kingless word sounds much better A world without king Cheesy af please change it to king of the kingless world it sounds much cooler and thats how it is in novel plus ruler of dark dimension outer god make it this way it will make sense in future one of the memorable chapters Yellow box I assume this means it is a higher ruling authority than the system used to create the blue boxes Remember when this was just killing bugs Ive been here since episode one and damn things change so quick This chapter was amazing Time to go get some free coins I can‚Äôt handle this cliffhanger The fact that Dokja got basically all the constellations on his side and created a new fable is really something It really shows you don‚Äôt need a sponsor to win the favour of the constellations the constellations are actually seeming to be pretty good now huh I NEED MORRE i needed a moment for that to sink in i was just sitting staring unblinkingly at my screen not even reading the top comments that i had just scrolled to applause for the author i was literally speechless Thank god the constellations intervened My respect for them increased I very much enjoyed this King of the world without a king oof King of a Kingless world sounded better Either way some dope shit coming up The King of the world without a king I still prefer the King of a Kingless World I hope they dont change the names like what happened in the translation in the novel in between cause its going to be a mess And the Outer Gods too Sigh Anyways but still I LOVE THIS SCENE Yes its the beginning Its starting Though Im 8 chapters ahead in the Manhwa Still I support Lezzgo ‚ÄòA mysterious ruler sees his chance in this world‚Äô ‚Ä¶now whos this Every chapter of this Webtoon is a gem This chapter gave me literal chills The fact that the constellations heard his wish for how he wanted to change the story and rewrite it theyre invested and they are looking out for him Thats such a big feat To have the constellations following your story Man dokja and his gang really came through Yall what just happened I want to read the original TWSA just to compare it to this cause I feel like the significance about some of this stuff is downplayed by our lack of knowledge of how things should be going in the original TWSA and how the world works meaning the story in the first world should have ended when he takes the throne so dokja managed to not end the story in the first world therefore no regression therefore part 2 I was astonished enthralledhappy scared bewilderedProud throughout the chapter A total package Kim Dokjawhat a amazin character he is AHH I WISH I HAVE MORE COINS I CANT WAITüò≠ dokja went to so many places did so many things but at the end is still wearing a jacket give my mam some clothes please üòÇ The plot is amazing the characters are amazing the art is amazing just everything about this Webtoon is absolutely amazing‚ÄºÔ∏èüò© what a great name King of the world without a kingI was waiting for it from novel Wowthis actually made me speechless for a bit Even with some mistranslations even with a bit of the mistranslations this chapter WAS SO GOOD yall are complaining about translations and stuff but its still a dope ass novel just enjoy it just remembered where has Gilyeong been this whole time its just soo cool the power of storytelling saving a story and having the viewer save you a story gains its power from what its readers want the levels the layers ough Damn Dokja really willing to die for this T T cant help but love these constellations for supporting Dokja got bit teary there Cant wait to see whats next oo This episode is gorgeous The art the story Just wow i do hope this gets an anime cause the scene in this episode with all the constellations is BEAUTIFUL Oohh did y‚Äôall notice that the title got rain drop stains Please listen to the people who say that King of a Kingless World is better because King of a world without a king is quite possibly the worst thing to say and read in the history of reading and writing my heart stopped for a moment I thought this was the end üòüüò≠ü•∫ It looks impressive to me that Dokja was willing to die or at least suffer a tremendous pain just for the sake of saving the world That is Just awesome I am so grateful to the author for giving us such a beautiful funny epic and tragic story It has been a long time since I havent loved a fiction that intensely Thank you so much I cant wait to see what is in store outside Seoul now Favorite episode so far in Omniscient Reader WOW‚Ä¶üëèüëèüëè BEST CHAPTER THAT LAST LINE IS SOOO GOOD Dude This has me cryING SO good üò≠üåüüåü just caught up finally im gonna be spending a lot of money on this comic arent i A new constellation has joined the star stream The constellation ‚ÄòDestinys Requiem‚Äô gazes in wonder upon the incarnation ‚ÄòDokja Kim‚Äô The constellation ‚ÄòDestinys Requiem‚Äô deeply approves of the incarnation ‚ÄòDokja Kim‚Äôs‚Äô actions thus far You have received 25 coins yo is our boy Dokja gonna start building up enough fables to become a constellation And this is the moment where everything begins ‚ú® if you haven‚Äôt yet I totally recommend finding and reading the novel to this If you‚Äôre enjoying the manga you‚Äôll love the novel so does that mean Dokja is being made into a protagonist now Dokja you‚Äôre a handsome bachelor incarnation why are you so surprised you‚Äôre popular My poor ass is sponsoring you 5 coins a week too Kinda wish it was ‚Äústory‚Äù rather than ‚Äúfable‚Äù but amazing feat nonetheless The Constellation Child of the Chaotic Mask is stunned by what has transpired 5 Coins have been giftedSeriously though WTF just happened Does this mean Dokja has earned the right to become a Constellation himself The last panel the message this whole chapterThe dang onion cutting ninjas are back ‚ï•Ôπè‚ï• the last pics he looks so beautiful ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ Man this is so cool wtf Something about the constellations taking pity on a human and sharing the burden almost made me tear up ü•∫‚ú® he looks so pretty in the last panel Reading this gave me chills that I rarely experience Good job Author You made a good WebToon THE GOOSEBUMPS READING THIS CHAPTER and i much prefer calling the fable King of a Kingless World just because it sounds cooler that way 33 So we aint gonna talk about how Dokja looks so beautiful in that position or im just stupid and a simp in the last panel i mean i can stare at it for hours mind blown rn ngl dokja be lookin pretty sexy in that last panel BEAUTIFULL CHAPTERR This is supposed to be the official translation why so many changes Like I already dont like it when they change the King of No Killing and some skills now its King of the Kingless Word It kinda ruins the story since names like those are important details Please dont change more than you did already because Im scared that the iconic demon king‚óºÔ∏è‚óºÔ∏è or ‚óºÔ∏è Company or the Sacrificial ‚óºÔ∏è will be changed Like at least choose more fitting alternatives if you need to change the translation It made me shed a few tears that Dokja was able to touch the constellations enough for them to decide to share the plausibility with him He changes the people around him damn this chapter was incredible nah this should defiantly get crunchyroll to do anime for this webtoon this is a webtoon where you dont need to fully understand the history cause you learn about it while rooting for these characters i cant stop stressing when dokja does something i think is stupid and win i know he will win but it always make me feel like hell lose this is too good to not get a anime that last panel 3 dokja my king of a kingless world CHILLS hopefully this manhwa will get at least the same amount of chapters as TWSA Why did the constellation of the prisoner of golden band didnt help woah love this chapter this webtoon is probably one of the best ive ever read Woah i got the chills This is so beautiful dokja is so dope How does this series keep getting better and better the more imposible you think it is ü§©ü§©ü§© ive come a long way but i still dont know the difference between plausibility and probability can someone enlighten The art is so majestic This is so damn good Thank you authornim and artistnim and Webtoon of course for having this Such a great quality platform to read an exquisite manhwa üíï this is much way better than Solo leveling The art soo beautifull i never forget to save some panel and make it my phone wallpaper üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è this panel is chefs kiss This I too am watching Well damn that was incredibly touching and poetic This was so uniquiely poetic HYPE HYPE HYPE REALLY LOVED THE HYPED CREATED IN THIS CHAPTER DANG This was on of those beast episodes where Dokja just showed us how OP the omniscient reader powers in the right hands are Dang ü§Øü§Øü§Øüòµ Throne go poof HOLY PIECE OF PIZZA THIS CHAPTER GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS ALL OVER Oo MA LORD I CANT‚ô° dokja has some üçëüò≥ This brings the feels man omg the cons are so niceüò≠ü§∫ It‚Äôs so heartwarming that Dokja has won the hearts of the constellations Congratulations you have achieved a non existing achievement this is me but NEVER wait so youre telling me this isnt the end of a season That chapter sure fit perfect as one final anime first or second season that was so epic why am i crying i dont even know what feeling this is what

the spider verse with its message And f that dokkebi NO WAY HES CONSTELLATION NOW Ayo I didnt wanted to read the novel because I have over 10 novels lined up waiting to be finished but now I am very intrigued and I can not wait for the next chapter so Im gonna go and read it I got goosebumps NOO I WANT TO READ MOREE11 Rn i just wanna cry idk why I hope we get an explanation why the dokkaibi is so EXTREMELY pissed meanwhile Im worried that dokja already changed the story so much that hes gonna become a character and loose the 3 person protection i‚Äôm literally crying this art and story is amazing Whoa ‚Ä¶ chills ahh i‚Äôm so emotional he finally got first fable now this is where things really begin Note it almost almost criedüò∂ I literally stoped it haha HOLY SHIETYT I GOT CHILLSS As a reader of the web novel this chapter and the whole series was pure gold I wish they went with outer gods instead of rulers of the dark dimension though in their translation though Easily one of the best if not the best chapter so far This chapter was epic üò≠üò≠üò≠ This just rose up to my top three fave webtoons quicker than Dokja can think goosebumps fucking goosebumps this arc is AWESOME Thank you constellations Thank you King of a Kingless World is where its at Im surprised many comments are saying the same l YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW BUMPY MY SKIN FEELS RN IM HAVING GOOSEBUMPS FOR THE PAST 3 MINUTES this chapter is fantastic god I love this so much The constelation daughter of a broken dream is looking forward the next chapter 5 coins have been gifted I REMEMBER SEEING THAT SWORD IN A KDRAMA SO THATS WHAT IT IS Literally got chills this chapter Can‚Äôt wait to see where the series will go I bow my head in respect Damn Dokja back at your suicidal tendencies I see Amazing ep dokja is amazing That was so epic What a great payoff of all these separate interactions coming together loved this chapter This scene hit me in the feels so hard Let see what story this new fable will make King of the World Without a King love that last visual This is literally taking your destiny by the hand bro some of these comments forget that this isnt their webtoon story to make üíÄ Waaoo this was unexpected Him turning into a fable possible a constellation if Im not wrong what an awesome success Kxnskfnwkdbws The last page was so beautiful Its sad how dokja took so much burden but amaizing how so many constellations started to support him from far away Is Dokja going to become a Constellation specifically the Constellation King of a Kingless World One of the best episodes so far this is the best webtoon ive ever read I much prefer Star Relic over Constellation Artifact The later may be accurate but the former just rolls off the tongue better Considering what they use to fight in this story I think its better to condense what you can Future fight scenes are going to be quite a mouthful as is which is why I also agree with the top comments i cant even begin to say how much feelings this comic gives me this is illegal Why not just keep using King of a Kingless World It sounds a lot better I want to see it animated iis this what has become of the comments section now disputing translations i smell a end of season cliff hanger coming soon The Fable The King of the world without a king is one of my favorite story What a great chapter This webtoon never fails to amaze me dude just turned into a god without expecting Soo did he became a constellation Will he be his own sponsor I like how the title is smudged by raindrops A small but nice feature to match the scenery this chapter unironically gave me chills‚Ä¶ wow AA Dokja sweetie you really are a king arent you boy It was so heartwarming when all the constellations started helping Dokja ‚ù§Ô∏è just amazing nice plot twist there D this is just too good very good for my heart üòÇ and here starts dokjas endless selfsacrificing nature that will piss junhyeok off ughh i just got goosebumps didnt think it would be possible with a webtoon ADFHJ Ngl this has been my favorite chapter so far Basically Dokja is breaking the entire game and i feel like this is just the beginning the goosebumps everytime üò´ I got literal chills when the constellations all teamed up to share the burden dayummm Dokja üò©üò≠ i‚Äôm obsessedd omygoshhh ladies and gentlemen hes broken the game The constellations are rooting for him Wowim speechless Wow this was epic Well done very well made Can we all agree that Dokja is a boss Here comes the Kingless World did dokja become a fabled constellation this story is just the best its my favorite everything is unpredictable you did well author ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ could someone explain plausibility please me no get it ü§∑ This series just jumped from a high 8 to a high 9 or solid 10 which means imma reread the shit out of this I liked the dokabei before this one hes not even cute goosebumps all over the place in this chapter i loved every part of this whole chapter woow just wow I dont understand what is a fable Damn this is so good ‚ï•Ôπè‚ï• I cant wait for the 5th scenario it will surely flood with comments „ÉΩ¬¥„Éº‰∫∫¬¥‚àáÔΩÄ‰∫∫–î¬¥„Éé Goosebumps on that last scene this is super good This chapter is just chef kiss Holy sht that was amazing wait did he become a constellation but he should be a mythical not fabeled or whatever the most powerful one is he deserves to be at the top I hope he can make his way up still YEAH DOKJAA UR SO BADASS WOOHOO king of a kingless world is such a better title its the original translation from the novel The translation feels so bad It is in consistent there is complete lack of flow every name feels clunky and forced i starting to think that some trash translator company was hired to translate this webtoon it is has level of some intern who is non native english speaker which finished his education in middle school NO they changed it from ‚ÄúKing of a Kingless World‚Äù TT man its annoying how many mistakes are made in these translations Holy craap it just gets better and better Good job to all the people working on this masterpeice WOO This story is so wonderfully done Dokja has gone from being a reader who never chose to be anything more to someone willing to give everything up to tell the story he wants told Beautiful writing dokja look thicc in the last panel üò≤üòâ Honestly Im at my wits end with Webtoon translators Its getting progressively worse As a novel reader I cringe at many of the choices theyve made Ruler of the dark dimension No its Outer God King of the World without a King FFS NO King of a Kingless World goosebumps seeing this scene drawn was amazingüò≥ I want to read novel BUT its way TOO long and I have VERY short patience üò≠ KING OF A WORLD WITHOUT A KING LETS GOO King of a Kingless World sounds much better tbh kinda wish whoever was translating this took some liberties Sure what was said was accurate but it certainly does not roll off the tongueEither way pog Fable 1 acquired Dojka managed to exceed my expectations once again üôÇ and the constellations helping him almost made me tear up tbh DDormamu This had me in tearsIt was so breathtaking And How is anyone even going to survive through the scenario if they havent read This is basically made so that no one survives right Somehow seeing the boxes turn gold because yellow doesn‚Äôt sound as god looks so satisfying ‚≠êÔ∏è They are looking at you üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è Ah the Stars have Alligned or have they Me this WEBTOON has over 60 episodes should keep me busy a whileMe two days later time to start spending some coins Not regretting spending 5 coins on this chapter üò≠üëè I‚Äôm glad I spent my hard earned 5 coins ‚ú® thats some END OF SEASON ONE shit right there wtf ü§Ø This whole comic has just escalated in such a fantastic way When I started reading I would have never imagined the journey this story would take me on would be so amazing At this point I have no idea what will happen next but Im excited to find out bro that was the best chapter yet omfg üëèüëèüëè Yo this is SO FING GOOD I dont think this episode is worthy of 5 coin like this ep is so heart warming and emotional I love this comic sooo much the extremely pissed off look of the White furry two horned gremlins face when Dojka was pretty much saying fck off I do what I want was funny as HELL but someone please take the time to read this and answer my few questions that I got cuz I didnt understand why the White furry gremlin was mad as HELL about the throne situation and I have a few questions to ask yall so please go and look at the questions in the replies sections some one please help It‚Äôs so good This is right up there with my favorite episode episode 40 I have absolutely no regrets spending coins on this Webtoon Damn it is so good this webtoon is the reason i‚Äôm broke and honestly i don‚Äôt regret a thing Take all of the coins I have I‚Äôm reading this like a movie and imagining it as such Goosebumps at the end of this episode can‚Äôt wait for the next one im so happy I put coins into this I love this comic so much the story keeps getting better and thrilling thank you I love this part so much but the name King of a Kingless World Gosh that was so amazing I too would like to see the end that Kim Dokja wants ‚ò∫Ô∏è Wait are we seeing what I think we are seeing ‚ÄúA new fable has been created‚Äù and the name ‚Äúthe king of a world without kings‚Äù does this mean Dokja is becoming a constellation himself or am I reading too much into this THAT WAS EPIC wow Im in awe üò≥ Im really curious how redice would interpret this chapter into drawing format and initially I thought they will do it in grand amazing and wow art like in other manhwas when the MC achieve something big but they use emotional approach instead and while it can be a lil bit underwhelming for me it just fits well in this chapter context especially when you already know what this chapter really is about and its implications it made this chapter 999 times more sadder I fast passed all the way here and I dont regret it one bit when the constellations shared burden of plausibility with dokja I almost shed a tear that was so goood I cant wait to see see the art with the story its such a good story and just keeps getting better This episode was awesome truly deserving the name of a fable The last two chapters gave me chills Absolutely stunning I am in awe This is such a fantastic story I cant wait for the rest üòç This episode was amazing I got chills I have school in like 5 hours spent probably 30 coins I have no regrets but Id have to wait longer for new chapters YESS IT IS YOUR STORY LET THEM KNOW DOKJA literally got chills when reading a new fable was created been such a long time since a story could get such a reaction from me well done author and artist and translater Im obessed with this I love it Everything in this chapter was priceless and utterly awesome long live to the King of the kingless world ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú® Wow our eyes are on you too Dokja Share with us the story you so desperately wish to tell SO FUCKING BADASS Kim Dokja destroyed the Absolute Throne with the same energy as Drogon melting the Iron Throne in GoT he almost got me in the first half not gonna lie i really thought dokja was gonna die for a second there the constellations are so nice Im on the edge of my seat like holy cow üò≠üò≠Why is this not a anime already Im really tired of the top comments being people complaining about the translation i am bankrupt and selling my children for this webtoon i hope this isnt the end Constellations Why take the hard road when theres an easier oneDokja Hey wait Im not dead yet my mans really said if you can‚Äôt beat them join them and became a fable Was it just me or this was a REALLY GOOD chapter I have bought almost every single episode that was come out this story is just too good almost cried bruh GAHHHD DAMN ü•µ favorite chapter so far this should seriously get an anime adaptation but idk how id handle waiting for each season THIS IS TOO GOOD The Constellation Unproductive Reader is looking at Incarnation Kim Dokja dang do yall see that azzüòç He has a big ass SHIII this is SO GOOD not usually one for action fantasy stories but holy balls this gave me so much goosebumps Its been so long since Ive found a good story that makes want to binge read or continue reading no matter what Im doing OOHOO AGORA SIM AS COISAS COME√áAM A FICAR S√âRIAS This chapter is my favorite that I‚Äôve read so far just because of how the constellations share his pain of plausibility It‚Äôs just this moment when they seems to regain their humanity and and really using him as a driving force to win this game once and for all WOW I am speechless Im pretty sure that its suppose to be King of a Kingless World one of my fav episode 3 i almost cried when the constellations shared his burden TT damn this feels like a cinematic masterpiece is this chapter a joke like its too amazing to be true king of a kingless world this chapter was so good my heart just went üìàüìâüìà when the constellations were sharing the burden I GOT A PHYSICS EXAM TOMORROW AT 7AM AND ITS ALREADY 4AM TF üíÄüíÄüíÄ PRAY FOR ME This is only the beggining Buckle up folks The constellations warned him clear enough you will die because of it but kdj answered thats my decision to make I like how fearless kdj is but at the same time I despise him for betting on his life so easily because the people around him surely fear his death And me too You should value your life more kdj OH MY GOD DOKJA The attention to detail Water droplets on the title page üíãüëåüèæ Can someone explain to me what had happened So the world ended but he is born again I‚Äôm very confused this has to be my favorite episode so far Whered secretive plotter go that constellation is usually the most active one you insignificant worm üòë Well you petty defected teddybear dont you dare say that to Dokja Am I crying YES I AM CRYING THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL a new fable was created for him üò≠üò≠üò≠ I stg Iam falling too hard for this man üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ This was beautiful ü§ç I like how the top comments were critiques in the grammar and not about how much more emotionally deep and thought provoking this Episode was Yes I‚Äôm sure they also believed that it was deep but still no need to point out things that aren‚Äôt that significant when it still gives off the same feel if it was translated slightly different Bro This Episode was absolute fire Personally I dont really see why people have a problem with the text It still means the same thing üòï this chapter tho üòôüëå This episode is so good Man my heart is literally racing in excitement This is this is incredible hes so attractive at the end goosebumps dokja i love u HOLYY This was so beautiful I want to cry WOAH ohhh Also this would be the perfect moment to end the season but they still moved on mm damn damn this chapter when i first read it gave me chills running through my whole body cuz of how good it was I deffinetly feel the Dokabies will realise eventually how Dojka is able to know what he is doing and has the knowledge of what could be happening in the future I have no idea what‚Äôs happening but that was cool lol bruh the last panel are just my tears dropping down the screen honestly I thought that he was gonna use his king attribute after it killed him and get back up for a small comedic moment alternatively this feels a little power of friendshipish but at the very least It makes some sense ‚ÄúKing of a kingless world‚Äù has a better ring and it‚Äôs shorter which emphasizes the irony The king of a kingless world sounds way better ‚ÄúBald Army General‚Äù this chapter was badass and cool to see comstellations help Dokja dokja Bro this is literally the coolest comic of ALL TIME GOD

can‚Äôt believe the Four Yin Demon Decapitator became an Constellation Artifact This episode has such an amazing translation This gave me freaking shivers man üòñ‚ù§Ô∏è so Dokja became a fable and therefore sort of like a constellation by the way i thught taht the other country had a throne too why this make it sound like it is only in koreaedit to answer yes i know that but if the other have a throne too whats the use of removing one the outer god will still be connected to the planet i red the book too but i never got that part I don‚Äôt get why the final panel is upside down tho WTF MAN

goosebumps holy i love how almost i guess all of the constellations subsided dokjas pain üò≠üò≠‚úãdammn i love this webtoon so much üíï Everything that hes doing Everything he believes and fights for I think Dokja will become a Constellation in his own right This is amazing beyond words bro I legit got goosebumps at the ending Give me shivers man we know who is the constellations favoriteüòÅ idky but i got a bit emo here he must have been really passionate about this story when he was reading it he really changed it to how he would have wanted it Dokja created a new Fable does this mean that he now transcends higher than a normal humans with lower constellations Well maybe Im wrong cause being an origin of a fable doesnt make one its main protagonistBut we all know that hes the main protagonist of this story anyway so No words Just Wow Youd think this would be part of a finale but theres still more Swag Daamn i got goosebumps now that was a solid conclusion This webtoon never ceases to amaze me it‚Äôs just godly King of a Kingless World Aaaa Here me out Read this episode with music I hold you by Clann Hits different Especially the ending damn this ep grabbed me by the neck and threw me against a wall My heart is beating so fast how can I wait another week Just another great episode I love the plot twists and even though he seems to know everything you can also see him

continues Infinite pride and affection overwhelms us Is Dokja going to die I dont know why but I felt like tapering up when constellations started to look upon Dokja DOKJA IS A LEGEND WBK you did well dokja HOLY‚Äì IS DOKJA A FABLE NOW üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•I AM IN LOVE Hol up remember yall how Constellations are ranked from Historic then Rare Mythical and the Ultra Rare Fables Dokja just became the newest Fable‚ÄùThe King of the World Without a King‚Äù I remember the other chapter where a constellation wanted him to promise that when he got to pick a constellation next to pick him WELL how about now Dokja IS the newest Constellation and a FABLE at that too I wonder what his powers will be too The constellation Giver of chocolate chipped circles stares down at the new fable created A cookie is sponsored as a bonus This here is one of my most favored moments in the Novell Can someone please explain what the burden of plausibility is oh my gosh this is so interesting Is this only half of the story I don‚Äôt want it to end yet üò≠ This sht is as good as a movie my god AHH My heart is pounding OUT of my chestüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ THIS IS EPICC Cant wait for next

burdensüò≠ my god this is so badass The king of a world without a king immeditially made me think of Viva La Viva song for some reason A twist I didnt see coming and a fantastic wrap to this story arc Beautiful that‚Äôs all I have to say WHOA WHOA WHOAA The plot and everything overall is just Chefs kiss the last panel was fabulous but i also loved that the title looked like some rain drops had fallen on it OMG WHAT A GREAT CHAPTER He cant die tho Wow the constellations shared the burden with him Amazing Team with Crunchyroll and make this an anime already That was so fucking cool I got goosebumps dang mind blown So he just died‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ahh the last panel hes so hot omg You are special You are loved epic Ah sunfish is deciding not to regress King of the World without King is good but I still hope that they keep the original King of the Kingless World naw what is up with these translations bring back king of a kingless world üò≠üò≠ it sounds so much more epic Cam just talk about how Dokja now has two constellation class weapon with the new onefour yin demon decapitated being able to serve the link between a constellation that‚Äôs just overpower and now Dokja has it I hope others survive is all I‚Äôm saying After reading this chapter I remember a certain quote in the back of my mind Dokja destroying the throne and Constellations watching has made him leave a strong legacy in changing everything Their world their fate and their future It is this quote that became the representation of what Dokja stand for so that people will not lose hope in their darkest hour This is Dokja‚Äôs legacy ‚ÄúThis is where your story begins‚Äù Will Dokja end up becoming a constellation himself The constellations gave him a title and even a fable about Dokja was created it seems he might atleast achieve something similar to a constellations level of power even if he doesnt become a constellation That was fantastic great job WTF why am i crying while the constelations look ay dokja screw this i love this story Idk but Kim Dokja looks oddly beautiful in the last panel üò≥üò≥ wait so dat man is a fable now this story just keeps on climbing and I am loving it Huh none of the usual constellations were helpingUriel Son Wu Kong ect You beautiful bitch Omg is Dokja gonna become a constellation I I almost thought Dokja will become a constellation Y‚Äôknow that Kim Dokja will always take the hard routes Easy ain‚Äôt always the best Damn it felt legendarily cool and satisfying No Dokja is not a constellation now Incarnations can achieve fables from my understanding with enough fables achieved and certain conditions met an incarnation can become a constellation maybe wait I think the constellations who were giving him coins did not join in üò£ i really like the details such as the end title being covered in raindrops on the paper it is written on This chapter was something else Anyone got the link to the light novel Im not doing so good I used my coins to

webtoon only had 10 chapters at the time and this is one of if not the best chapters with this series theres a few more noticable chapters as well but this really was the best for me im so glad webtoon has done the novel justice he sure looks more like a protagonist than the protagonist himself this mf still think hes not a main character someone needs to fix his self eestem bc though it doesnt seem fucked up how can a guy be so blind about his own awesomeness Cant believe that I just cried because of how epic that was TOP TIER EPISODE Well dang tht was beautiful and touching ü•∫ my

dhdjjdd man just became a constellation with his new found title are constellations calling him an equal bro i have goosebumps someone told me dokja will be gone üò≠ i hope its not Dokja you monster You did it You are the King of the Kingless World awestruck Ive come this far Im this webtoon but I still dont understand a thing but I still love to read it crying shitting throwing up kdj is so

get it damn i wouldve cried can someone explain to me plausibility and what dokja meant by that he tried his best to make things seem probable Well everything is fine but my instincts say that blondish girl from Dokjas officeSangah is dangerous or is hiding something King of the world without a king yup thats Dokja alright soif he started a new fable doesnt that mean after he dies he could become a constellation Tis nothing but a scratch this will be my favorite chapter tbh I like King of a World without a King over the other translation better symmetry Its so beautiful The constellation are simps of Dokja D I want a drama of this line by line with every tiny details with the greatest special effects that exists in the whole world „ÉòÔΩ•ÔΩ•„Éò‚î≥‚îÅ‚î≥

AT MY HOUSE THIS IS CRAZY THAT WAS A SUPER GOOD EPISODE Its lit üëå still waiting for 68 But I think that the author wrote TWSA so that Dokja would see how the world would be like without him or to warn him about the new world and to be there saviour every time these cliffhangers are too much every time All The Constellations Someone are looking at You Dokja Man this is ust epic omggg wait what CONSTELLATION EMPRESS SAMIRAH IS LOOKING AT YOU NOO I NEED MORE The Constellation ENIGMA Is Looking At You unbound by the text before him the reader transcends the narrative to write a new one in the pages Not going to lie I teared up for this chapter and to think I only started this series two days ago and binged it all woah goosebumps You can add the star to start It could just be typo or a misspelling but it was a crucial word to get wrong and might confuse the readers Um so senpai notice me THE KING OF THE WORLD WITHOUT A KING What a beautiful plot Brace yourselves up folks this story

Dokja going CRAZY Amazing chapter this story is enthralling That was an awesome chapter Wow thats amazing JCJFJJXJDNE omg wahh I died at how gud dis is DOKJA LEGEND Wow I have been hooked to this but wow‚Ä¶It got even better This is EPIC this story keeps getting better üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è I like this story a lot but I think it illustrates the concept in Eastern culture that I would call secret knowledgeYou know like in many Japanese games you would profit a lot from knowing smth from guides outside of the game Or if youre playing it a second time And like that in this scenario there was nothing from which you couldve come to conclusion that the throne is so dangerous It was totally indeductible from prior knowledge I want to know what does the author usually mean by constellations As sometimes even the stars are mentioned as a constellation like in this chapter At this pint there‚Äôs on right for Junghyeok yu to be the hero of TWSA he always sleeping find everything is ready Dojka is working so hard I want to fight ü§∫ any one saying he‚Äôs not hot he is so handsome and cute sometimes Chills man THANKS AUTHOR IM SO EXCITED FOR THE NEXT CHAPS Im sorry but Im literally flipping out

wait to read more omg i just noticed that this is barely chp 15 isnt the novel like 500 üò≥ very tempted to read it ‚ÄúThree Ways To Survive The Apocalypse‚Äù could this be one of the ways Could the title actually indicate the web novel was meant to serve as a guide to actually ending the apocalypse ‚ÄúDo these three specific but insanely hard tasks and the world will not end‚Äù This was one of the most satisfying episodes so far its like the ending or not quite ending of a movie when the good guys win i thoroughly enjoyed it Damn that last panel gave me goosebumps could everyone see the Golden screen at the end or only mc Holy shit üî•üî•üî• Omg OMG Wheres Paimon Now he has a fable the other constellations are gonna be trying to sponsor him so hard lol i genuinely believe this is my favorite chapter so far The EPICNESS üî•‚ú®üååüëåüèª Ohhh This Was So POWERFUL üî•üî•üî•üî•My emotions are a mess ü§Ø internally screaming So since he‚Äôs a fable that means in order for his story to be a legit there can be no regressions bc everyone in the story is supposed to only live once to make it a whole and true story Will he become a constellation then when he dies Damnit it seems it‚Äôs finally time for me read the LN I need to understand what this means Holy HELL that was EPIC The translation is killing me but I hope it gets to improve in later chapters tho look at dokja at the last panel hes such a beautiful man THAT WAS SO COOL WTH AA KING SHIT every week i come here and internally scream my head off about how cool dokja is that one time a fanmade story is more interesting than the real ones I absolutely love how the main character has planned everything and the payoff of just watching the main character carry out the plan is amazing Kudos to the people who made this you did amazing dude sorry Im so stupid but what do they mean bythe burden of plausibility could someone explain please This was AWESOME üëè üëè does this mean his story was becoming a fable üòÆ GIVMME THE NEXT EPISODE IM OBCESSED WITH THIS BUT IM BROKE That was touching ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ Holy shit The writing and art continues to amaze me Praise those Constellations Lots of things he did change the storyline but this this right here change everything He literally change the gameplan dokkaebi has plan out Wow The king of the world without a king So impressive This webtoon never

THIS IS SICK EVERY EPISODE MAKES MY HEART EXITED BRO I MIGHT GET A DISEASE King of a kingless world Dojka u smart cookie u question for those that have read the ink and paper are we nearing the end of

HYPE Goosebumps Constellations be like üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è nirvanamoebius god dokja big dipper Ive come to bargain that last panel absolutely gorgeous ‚ù§ Ddid Did he just become a constellation the constilation if the big diaper is my favorite constilation irl i look at it every night HOLY FREAKING CRAP THIS CHAPTER 10010 rating the was great aa dokja finally got his first great fable Ok but the water droplets on the name So the reason Dokja destroyed the throne is that if he sits on it this world ends So only the one who sat on it will go to the next regression and everyone else die except Jung hyeok since he‚Äôs the main char of the world Am i understanding this right Man that was insane I legit thought he was gonna die I just have one word for this whole serie WOW Ong that was so cool cant wait for the next part and king of the world without a king is cool I wonder how much coins he will get or how mad the cute thing will be WHAT JUST HAPPENED did he just become a fabled constellation Beautiful chapter Very awesome Super curious to see where the story goes now that this capture the flagget the throne scenario seems to be ending Idk what just happened but it was cool This is the second time i‚Äôve cries reading this ep is so good „Ö†„Ö† And now the true story begins Im calling it now Dokja is a constellation and the story he read was just his future self somehow This gave me CHILLS It was worth more than 5 coins thats for sure Yall when I say I screamed I literally screamed THIS EP WAS THE BEST BY FAR So in case of something theres a chance dokja can be a constellation now that hes a fable But ofc for him to succeed that cant happen its a little thought I had while readingomg Im so excited for whats coming like this is setting more new boundaries i am cryingüò≠üòµ this is mind blowing i am stunned I feel overwhelmed with the support that Dokja has recieved in the previous ep and this one too It ist just fucking amanzing what an absolute king no

JRHDHDUEYDYSYDUJDHHDBDVDBSHSHSJSNSNDHDGDGDSYSH The Kingdom Hearts music I listen to while I read this comic sure did sync beautifully with this scene king of the world without a king has a beautiful meaningin ancient time the king will be someone from the royal family they have to have the connection with the king and for this scenario Dokja would be a king if he had the throne of a different king but he didnt want to get that which is tied with another king nHe wanted to tell that he will be someone who can fulfill the dutys of a King and also can gain the respect of other kings without the help of another king nüçÅüçÅüçÅüçÅ WAIT DID HE LIKE UHM BECAME A CONSTELLATION OR SOMETHING dokjaa wow AMAZING üëèüëèüëè I feel like he might come back because when he destroyed the throne

constellation ÔΩ°‚ô°‚Äø‚ô°ÔΩ°‚óè‚ô°‚àÄ‚ô° I respect his character Sometimes the protagonist who is said to be the protagonist need not be the one Kim Dokja youre such a main character and I love you bro tht gave me chills woo damn idk about you but this is my most favorite novel webtoon and I freaking need a physical book English version for this kudos to the constellations I wonder what would happen if Junyeok could also see Dokja‚Äòs point of view everytime he gets beaten unconscious Unlikely to happen cause he doesn‚Äòt has the matching skill but still just wondering I think I might start reading this WebtoonIll think about it though üò© my favorite chapter so far the true story will begin here i absolutely love this everything is amazing The constellations helped him Im cryingüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ just wow its overwhelming holy crap it‚Äôs raining rn and wow that‚Äôs really setting the mood omfg this guy is so pretty ion know what everyone else is talking abt üò≠ wait

touchingIm rooting for you too üò≠üò≠üí™üèºüí™üèº This is amazing gahhgg I love it what is the burden of plausibility I didnt see an explanation and it dont make sense to me from context why did he almost die WAIT I DONT UNDERSTANDüò≠ why would they create a new story my brain is malfunctioning brava what a beautifully written succinct wrap to this plot well done keep up the good worküñ§ how did he know that so does that mean that he would be the last person to die in this regression Reading this chapter with God Shattering Star playing in the background was an awesome experience So proud of my man Dokjaü§ó that was amazing I dont understand the plausibility probability thing Hooo I KNEW IT I FACKIN KNEW IT mainly because i was imagining an OC because im not onetrack minded anyways i pretty much guessed this OH MY GOODNESS Constellation Constant Thinking Ocean did a spit take in shock did did Dokja just earn his Constellation title omfg fav chapter so far The constellation Crown of Applpi is looking at Kim Dojka oh man OO I dont understand the plausibility thing but I do love this comic I‚Äôm not even sure what‚Äôs happening in the story anymore selfharm colorless by nekobolo and catharsis by aether was such good songs to listen to while reading this chapter That was amazing 00 √ë estaba tan bueno el anterior que me pase este con diccionario en mano they shouldve just stayed with king of kingless world because that sounds so good and badass than whats written above this is so beautifulüò≠ My mans Dokja actually survived CHILLSS Well done dokja lol why did the change the name GOATED Chapter I read the whole web novel and still never understood why is it so bad for someone to sit on the throne can someone explain what is going on PLEASE nice ass üëç hj hehehheuntil he does get regression and then he repeats it with The mc of twsa I just realized that I cant spell his name but Im too lazy to go check it Im probably getting ahead of myself tho Dokjaa üå± How about if the fable would be called Uncrowned king of the world or Worlds uncrowned king ü§î Wait he said he won‚Äôt need a next regression maybe Sonja has lived three this in the form of how ever many regressions and he‚Äôs finally gotten this ending the ending he wanted and the outcome he wanted idk if this is possible but my brain had a light bulb moment The King of the World without a King üëëSink af Isnt the blade supposed to brake after the the throne does But technically he is a king so its not literally a kingless world right If you are confused the translation is a bit shaky King of the world Without a king would basically mean Throneless king I dont know man it seems off to me but besides that this chapter was heat BRUHHH THE CHANGED TRANSLATIONS ERK ME SO NMUCHHDH That was beautiful Seeing all the constellations he ever touched somehow help him out but did he like become a constellation cause fables are the people behind the constellation right im not sure tho sheesh OKAY I SUSPECTED HE WAS AT S POINT THIS COULD HAPPEN BUT IM STILL SUPER JAZZED AMD SUPRUSED ABT IT YESSS Dokja LES LES LES LES LES LES LES GOO Where can I find the finished webtoon

he just wanted to cut the tie between the outer gods and this world to give it a better ending than TWSAs hmm Id prefer it if they actually translated the names of each of the stars of the big dipper Like the seven stars are actually called Alioth Dubhe Merak Phecda Megrez Mizar and Alkaid But they also apparently have titles because theyre dieties in korean folklore collectively called Chilseong That was beautiful man This episode was just simply so beautiful Woo The boy got his first Fable üëèüëèüëè This novel reader is excited to see the next chapters the art is gorgeous especially that last panel of Dokja ‚ô° truly a wonder tuesday I started cackling like a madman about halfway through this chapter and didn‚Äôt stop until the end‚Ä¶ so question did Dokija just die and become a fable

A whole new level has begun When I first came to Webtoons Omniscient Reader was the first novel I started Words cannot describe the enjoyment I have got throughout this thrilling adventure Thank you so much for creating this I will forever give you all the coins this right here ladies and gentlemen is the beginning of something great I can feel it „ÄåThe constellation NEPTUNES is so proud of Dokja for his wits and choosing not to stray the path of a true king„Äç Thus a new Story has begun upon us and we set sail with the 7 stars of the Big Dipper let us be worthy of their help in fending of these countless foes 5 coins for Gryffindor‚Ä¶ jkjk I mean Dokja JUST SAY KING OF A KINGLESS WORLD HOW HARD IS THAT would be nice to change to king of a kingless world it sounds way better Am I the only one who is feeling really confused by the mistranslation corrections at this pointüòÖ come on constellations an goat man give our guy all the rewards he deserves for being dope asf to turn down power an a kingship is a mighty sacrifice at 5he very least upgrade his skills or let him pick the constellation he wants that he mentioned long ago be his supporter Wait‚Ä¶ where is Lazy broke weeb ‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt go too broke to read right üò≠üò≠üò≠ The constellation Foolish Husband of the Sun is hopeful this means a new constellation be born 5 coins have been sponsored Dojkawow dude A man with no constellation has gotten so much from them they dont want his story to end just yet There was some big foreshadowing in this chapter probably for things we wont see for dozens of scenarios and hundreds of chapters but Im really excited for it either way May Death do us part‚Ä¶ huiwon and sangah so hot What is YJH going to think when he awakens again Holy sht is this the beginning of a legend The constellations sharing his pain my heart ü•∫ The translations are really‚Ä¶ Off in this webtoon version this webtoon seriously needs to be a movie this chapter was epic and gave me goosebumps really dislike translation of some things here ofc I appreciate the work but we have Google for a reason He said that there is no next regression for him so he would finish the story in this world so technically my theory in this is what if he just fall asleep in the train after he finished reading the story because he is too tired from work and when he finally reached the end of the story he will wake up exactly at his home destination and will continue his life because all of the happenings is just his dream God motherfucking damn our Dokja became a god damn constellation and a fabled one at that Is it just me or does this chapter feel way shorter than the others You have achieve the non existing achievement Me in my studies DamnDokja has broken every possible 4th wall and created his ownnAhh is itreally coming to an end king of the world without a throne sounds more better no when u just wanted to screenshot but u cant lmao The constellation Stormy Ram King dropped his

plausibility MEANS Just wow thank you whoa I love this story and the art so much each episode is such a pleasant surprise This feels surprisinglyless triumphant than the story made it in my head when reading it I kinda like the mood change Your boy Dokja just hit the Ultimate Combat move So Dokja has become a Story not just the reader Glad to see him be put in the rightful place Rip king of a kingless world It was a much better name for the story compared to this I got such a big shiver from this The author and artist are working so well together Im kind of lost on what this means going forward Holy sht that was beautiful A new Fable has been created ‚ÄúA King in a World without a King‚Äù The constellations look down at Dokja with a newfound respect Hundreds of coins are being

       "'Im not sure I like the translation of Dokjas fable here sure King of the World without a King is technically correct but King of a Kingless World sounds better Its easier to say at least The starts are beautiful at night arent theyIn a Kingless World  Please change ruler of the dark dimension to outer god The Aliens Outer gods we saw in ch42 was a mistake on the fandoms part as the KR ver said  people from another world not   gods from another worldouter gods The real   appears in this chapter but is now translated as ruler of the dark dimension which gives no context as outer god does Edit Theres a list of LINEs mistranslations by ulololwarrior if you want to know all their mistakes so far The constellation Lazy Broke Weeb is looking at you Nobody can tell me this chapter wasnt a movie I just watched in IMAX The constellations taking the burden from dokja was awesome its just letting you know even the constellations are much more interested in an alternate fable The fact that he didnt expect the constellations to share the burden and the fact they did is so cool and heart warming Am I the only one who got literal chills when the constellations all teamed up to share the burden I would love to play a game where an achievement popped with youve done something so rad and unheard of that we created this specifically because of you Dokja has achieved more in one regression than Junyeok did in like 80 I sponsor this episode to share the burden of financial stress with the Author 5 Coins Spent The fable the king of the World without a King has been created Guys its his FIRST FABLE Im getting emotional  This is the beginning Super excited for the future chapter 5 coins has been sponsored KING OF A KINGLESS WORLD This would make such an amazing anime Which constellation do I have to pay to make that happen God I love this story So many twist and turns yet so well written 1010 Hes not the protagonist we were promised but hes the one we got All Hail the King of the Kingless This webtoon is so visually stunning that I just cant Like the way those speech bubbles overlapped to show that the constellations speak simultaneously Wow As each constellation looked at him to share his burden it made me tear up a little Dokja making friends everywhere CHILLS LITERAL CHILLS WORTH EVERY CENT The Constellation LADY OF THE SINGULAR FOOTWEAR is stunned into awed silence 5 coins have been gifted I really enjoy seeing dokaebis get mad I literally cannot throw money at my screen hard enough for this title If you didnt get goosebumps did you even read the chapter  By far one of the best webtoons on this app Theres a thousand titles that Dokja could have and all of them are badass But King of the Kingless World is better than all of them The Constellation Lord of the Bleeding Wallet is looking at the author5 coins have been sponsored Oh my God this chapter just gave me chillsthat panel with Dokja under the rain is incredible this series keeps getting better and better So he just became his own constellation The Constellation Lonesome Dragon believes King of a Kingless world sounds like a worthy title for Dokja he wants to see the end of his story as well 5 coins have been sponsored I do not regret spending the coins I have on this BIG SHOUTOUT TO YI SUNSIN MARITIME WAR GOD FOR BEING THE FIRST CONSTELLATION TO SHARE KDJS PROBABILITY The declaration of Dokjas fable in gold was so great I was scared for the translation of the fable and even though it is a bit of a mouthful compared to King of a Kingless World Im fine with it If anyone was wondering plausibility is the chance of something happening since destroying the throne by borrowing the constellations powers has never been achieved before and is not plausible to a point Dokja suffers adverse effects Sorry if its still not clear i dont know man king of a kingless world rolls off the tongue more smoothly but king of a world without a king sounds like a title of a story or in this case a fable Still thinking about how that little girl barfed up a flag pole I will end the STORY of this world  all along he wanted to save his friends from becoming characters remain human POWERFUL WORDS Now they begin their own path  Out of all of Omniscient Reader the first Fable is probably my favorite and this was an amazing adaptationDefinitely think the translator should stick with King of a Kingless World rather than the current as some others have pointed outnAlso I don think it was meant to be Ruler of the Dark Dimension unless that is going to be the official TL from now on May need to clarify because that sounds pretty easily confusable with the Demons that last panel has me feeling a jumble of emotions his expression is justI dont even have a word for it I feel like I need to reread from the beginning and make a glossary as I go cuz I know something big happened with the new fable being created but I feel like my brain isnt fully grasping the magnitude of it I got emotional when they started to share the burden Im such a big old baby  I cant explain how moving it was to see Dokja risk his life to show the constellations a new and better story I couldnt say I would be willing to do the same Be more like Dokja The there is NO NEXT REGRESSION for me in this world really open your eyes that they wont have 2nd chance in life once their luck runs out I know this is based on a novel so I really wanna go read it right now assuming theres a translated version out there but at the same time I know myself well enough to say that theres a 99 chance that Ill never return to this Webtoon if I do because my brain gets bored with repeating stories and I really REALLY wanna keep supporting this Webtoon Waitso has our boi gone from reader to author This was so epic The constellations coming together to help him his speech about using the descendants for power Everyone banding together and trusting him Just dang I wasnt expecting all of this So good  king of the world without a king is such a mouthful tbh I wasnt sure about Dokja as a protagonist because it felt like everything he was doing no matter how good it seemed was ultimately selfserving Now we see what his real end goal was not to survive but to make sure the world makes it through Thats a hero worth believing in BIG SHOUTOUT TO YI SUNSIN MARITIME WAR GOD FOR

Mythical means Mythgrade next is Fabled means Fablegrade last is Historical Historygrade Term Fable used in this chapter is not referring to Constellations grade but the essence of someones power in ORV When ones achievement is significant and recognised by Star Stream they earn a Fable DOKJA YOUVE ALWAYS BEEN A KING IN MY EYES  Ok So fables were called stories in the novel Earning a fable does not equate becoming a fable constellation All constellation have accumulated fables and incarnations can accumulate fables as well The accumulated fables make up the constellations power in their case and thats why their ranked usually by how wellknown their fables are I saw a few people getting confused over this I dont have the biggest issue with the translation change but its starting to cause confusion did this seem short I know it wasnt short but it seemed shortam I just being greedy I want morehere are my 5 I will pay more  The last panel is so beautiful You can see the pain on his face but his determination is strong So we all agree that King of a Kingless World sounds so much better and thats the translation well be using right I BLESS EVERYONE THAT ARE INVOLVE IN THIS WEBTOON TO HAVE CLEAR SKIN GOOD MEALS AND MAY ODDS BE IN THEIR FAVOR AT THE END OF THE DAY THANK YOU FOR THIS MASTERPIECE And so the story begins This feels like the prologue Now I am excited to see how each character develops their abilities new constellations to be introduced and the wonderful new items Thank you for this great adventure  who else had Goosebumps when the constellations started looking down on him King of a Kingless World just hits different why does the novel names and fan translated always hit better  Wow I got goosebumps Thank you for this having not read the book i am LOSING my shit here I appreciate the people correcting the translations but sometimes I just want to go to the comments and talk about how cool the chapter was Most of the time I dont even care about the misstransaltions Round of applause for this episode  Goddamn that was amazing This episode was REVOLUTIONARY THANK YOU AUTHOR D If he becomes important enough could he become a constellation The writing the story telling the climax and the ending of this one episode is just utterly outstanding Chills just chills Its so beautifully written and Im not going to miss a single bit of this because its amazing i got rising chills as more constellations looked at him god i love this webtoon chills literal chills from this chapter King of the Kingless World you have achieved a nonexistant achievement Yeah that sounds plausible I was mesmerized by the way they stacked the speech bubbles to indicate there are multiple voices but damn I didnt expect that emotional scene at all got me teared up with the togetherness trope lmao Im weak with that trope But seriously how dokja can think of anything so clearly every time is a bit too OP lol I dont think I could react like him even if I got isekaid to my favorite mmorpg that Ive played for 8 years Surely Id make a lot of blunders and doubting myself lol MY HEART Please I wish everyone who has Webtoon reads this It deserves every single adaptation known to mankind for being so fcking amazing  Man this series Rocks I legit started to tear up when the constellations saved him The GUY just unlocked A HIFDEN ACHIVMENT Damn what a good chapter I love the subtle change of the raindrops on the titlelogo I know translating webtoon is hard so thank you for your effort despite the barrage of criticism but Id hoped the translators take care with the research and the phrasing more Ive noticed several times that some choice of translations removed a good chunk of foreshadowings it makes me sad what kind of anime finale heartstrings pulling shit is this how DARE you make me emotional A feat so great that you are awarded an achievement that doesnt exist Thats beyond true gaming Although the webtoons translation is okay theres so much mistranslation and better words they couldve used King of a World without a King is one big missed opportunity to just put King of a Kingless World as it sounds better Idk about the other translations but I hope webtoon could hear out the readers and use the rightbetter translation Im not crying your crying man Binyeongs streaming channel must be soaring through the roof i wanna see his reaction As strong as this chapter is there are some things it can be improved on translation wise Like King of a world without a king would have sounded better as King of a Kingless World because during the last 5 players involved yeah they were kings but are they still after losing since there is only supposed to be one King in the end to take the throne but he destroyed it So the other kings wouldnt be kings anymore after losing if I saw how the event worked Damn Actual chills at the end there One of my favorite chapters The art was gorgeous and the pacing and paneling was done really well that was beautiful when you become the main character  wipes tear Im waiting for you in the  Dokja  I literally cried at the end its so damn good and as a novel reader who loves this story heartily the importance of this fable and the emotions I felt this chapter ahh it was soo good the only thing I didnt like is the webtoon using king of the world without a king instead of king of kingless world I feel so attached to the latter And all these starsconstellations sharing the aftermath of plausibility is heart warming I also like how his friends were so worried for him All the top comments are about translation mistakes are we not gonna acknowledge how fucking badass that was he made all the constellations so intrigued by him that they want him to live  This arc is so beautiful The constellations are watching a show run how theyve never seen it run before Theyve grown to like him and his interesting talewatching him die would bring only sorrow for them so theyre helping him live they cant allow their show to end a show with its most interesting character gone is no longer as interesting or special I like other translations better king of a kingless world Dokja Im going to do whats called a pro gamer moveProceeds to destroy major plot device Intern creating a brand new story why did this feel so so so uh idk how to explain but like powerful did anyone else cry when the constellations shares the plausibility no just me ok holy shit the last panel beautiful Whoever said Dokja wasnt hot is wrong SHEESH this chapter gave me literal chills Dokja is so COOL The first tale of this story has been aquired Im getting goosebumps nThe fact that the webtoon art is still so stellar not only does the novel justice but brings more depth and heightens expirence in a story that captures first readers and the novel readers Seeing what wasnt described and what was Rereading at its finest  Dokja you might not be a King there but in our heart you are the King of Kings I got chills damn i actually teared up this chapter was so good Does this mean that theres a possibility of Dokja becoming a constellation I got chills seeing the constellations share his burden whoa this story is so good should have use King of a Kingless World but regardless this chapter always gives me chills  all hail king of kingless world Bro my man out here creating fables Did he just become a freakin constellation Did man just become a constellation Were all looking at you Dokja and smiling all I can is COOL DOKJA  goddamn Im tearyeyed from all this epicness and

tutorial soon and into grand adventures bro this was the best episode Anyone else just feel extremely satisfied with how every little action and choice Dokja made has lead to this glorious moment Cause Im just floating on cloud 9 those constellation poppings are really giving me goosebumps Stars I can see the stars again mlady like if you get it  Chills literal chills Now that is how you go from side character to main character MC lol i need this to be an anime wait we will remember you does that mean when he dies hell become a constellation I think this is one of my favourite epsiodes I was so impressed with this episode and completely surpriseddisheartened that the three top comments are critiques This episode was SO good please keep it up THE KING OF A KINGLESS WORLD BROOO I CANT WAIT Im crying  the constellations sharing his plausibility is too much for my heart I feel like every new chapter is my new favorite chapter This was STUNNING All hail the King of the Kingless World  The constellation reader of the reader of the world smiles upon you When the constellations started looking at him one by one Oh god that scene was awesome I know the majority of manhwascomics are based off of light novels but I think this is one of the first where Ive been willing to read the actual light novel The plot did that much of a good job Props to singnsong tbh this story is absolutely amazing probably the best on this app period I CANT FUCKING WAIT I WANT MOREE Again the illustrators come with amazing adaptation of the text to image I love how they display constellations speaking to Dokja Im sorry but can we stop complaining about the translation This was such an amazing and awesome chapter that should be praised I loved every part of this That feeling when youre glad you invested all that time into side quests When youve entertained the audience so much theyre now supporters HOLLY SHT THE MOTHERFCKING BTCH DID IT HOW HOW HOW TF CAN SOMEONE BE SO FCKING AWESOME MAD RESPECT u200du200d Im tearing up this feels like watching a movie all of sudden I love how they chose to share his burden wow that was so inspiring and just wow WHY DID I FIND THIS WHOLESOME IM ALMOST CRYING was i the only one teary eyed when the constellations started looking at dokja when he was in pain  one of the most memorable scenario in the webnovel webtoon made it possible seeing it come to life  holy shit dokja is so incredible  hes strong intelligent brave and has the constellations on his side hes unmatched fr This chapter was E P I C Can we just pause for a sec and thank the author for this This is so beautiful  this chapter will have my HEART always the last panel is so beautiful istg I dont know why but this chapter had some feeling in it This was probably the coolest episode so far It makes me so excited  For a second I thought that Dokja was gonna become a costellation was I the only one the constollation god of ships is sharing the burden after being away for about a week because ofrestrictions speechless what beautiful writing some of the translations are wonky king of a kingless world is better but overall a fantastic chapter and climax to one of my fav arcs X Thank you for the story author this is just Incredible for some reason this chapter was emotionally deep loved it oo continues to eat popcorn slowly so glad Im not the only one who read the novel then went here to read the comic as well anyone else terrified to stop reading Who brought the onions This webtoon is amazing  Got to be honest when the constellations were looking at him it felt badassgood job king of the kingless world dokja we are all here to listen to your story constellationyou will surely dieplot armor like am I a joke to you The hairs on my arms stood up while reading this So freaking good read  I waited literally all day for this It did not disappoint This is my favorite web toon The art the plot the character development all of it Just amazing Thank you author for making my day a little better  Author Artist and all of those that helped make this chapter a reality thank you very much love the chapter but i honestly prefer king of a kingless world and outer gods a lot more as possible translations King of a kingless world m imagining a Netflix series lol The storytelling of this webtoon is unmatched Each chapter tops the last They need to adapt this into an anime asap  This is why Omniscient Reader is my favorite webtoon absolutely stunning from art to story magnificent it somehow made me a lil emotional when all those screen messages of the various Constellations showed up helping him burden the plausibility dokja is pretty amazing Dont worry about the blood folks Its just internal bleeding and internal is where the blood is supposed to be anyway the art is just chefs kiss even the constellations wants to see the Dokjas story and now he has a FABLE A Kingless World  im a novel reader but i think yall too pressed about mistranslations unless it really disrupts the plotunderstanding its not much of a big deal errwhy not just say king of a kingless world its easier and thats how they refer to it in the light novel this is one of my favourite scenes in the novel the moment when dokja made his first step towards the end the moment the concept of probability was first introduced the moment dokja became King of the kingless world the moment everything started going downhill to all that are reading this for the first time prepare yourselves because not even the Fourth wall can save you from the hardships thats gonna come in the following arcs ORV true story starts here For those who are confused what is fable think of legendarymythical heros They have their own storyfables becoming a heroic beings like Hercules going through 12 labors Odysseus trojan horse Sun Wukong starting a war against heavens It is their achievements that show their strength and spread their reputation In ORV such stories are called fables and this fable system is very important directly related to constellationincarnations strength Damn yall being picky with the wording Enjoy the story either way ya salty scrubs Yo Dokja is SUCH a BADDIE Literally the Constellations love him so much or at least respect him so much that they were willing to SHARE PAIN with a MERE HUMAN Dokja truly is incredible DOKJA IS SO PRETTY LOOK AT THAT LAST PANEL AHH My man just weaves out a new storyline Make your own path blaze your own trail Believe in yourself This is by far the best webcomic on webtoon in my personal opinion keep it up The art in this chapter was amazing author started out with great art style and its only gotten better and better with each episode Wow this gave me chills This has been an amazing series thus far but this chapter has pushed it into legendary territory Bravo author the grip dokja has on my soul That was so fucking cool i got chills when the constellations helped dokja that was so cool Got goosebumps when the constellations started to share the burden of plausibility this episode felt so cinematic i got shivers reading it Wha WHAT This is just too much I cant even find the words to say how much I love this story it just blows my mind EVERY SINGLE CHAPTER and Im living for it Omniscent Reader is just amazing The Naval warefare god is a real one for being the first to share the burden The Bald army general probably helped as a way to pay dokja cause he dosent have many coins omg  this was so beautiful My man really knows whats what this is what makes him an awesome character Im loking at you Dokja  i hoped they kept the title king of the kingless world from the novel for me it sounds better Also at the end the title panel shouldve been kinda smudged or wobbly coz the artist intended for it to be that way to give it a crumpledsadlonely effect To add with the feeling of the rain and Dokjas condition at the end The artist gave a good adaptation so i just think its good to honor their efforts now it just seem like some of its wasted I hope this isnt ending any time soon I feel like its only really started Its been quite some time since I was so impacted by a story A New Fable Dokjas story to tell Thanks Author Artists and all collaborators for this amazing tale The fucking GOAT i miss our initial broadcaster this one is so buthurt and angry all the time He really is such an amazing character The Gods respect him he beat the strongest man he defied the rulers of scenarios he broke the system into rewarding him with a non existent achievement he a mere human became the highest rank of constellations and most importantly he created the ending he wanted and became The King of a World Without a King Talk about a hardcore stargazer When the constellations started to share his burden you can just tell that they arent just in it to be entertained anymore they really want Dokja to survive because they cant comprehend him that was quite the cinematic experience Dokja you majestic bstard  a mysterious ruler has noticed a sudden chance in this world shouldnt that be change not chance Ive completed the novel but seriously Im so emotional to see him create his first fable  King of a kingless world his first big achievement Man I straight up got chills while Im loving every single episode this one just hit me different Why cant I live more than one like  this episode brought the thrills and the feels Quite an astonishing moment I would not lie Beautiful Im just gonna leave this comment here so I can come back and remember this chapter This chapter made me emotional They shared the burden TT even though constellations are beings who treat human life like worms this was very humane for them  okay but whos still amazed by everythingITS ALL SO GOOD AND PRETTY AND SPECTACULAR these last four chapters are what made me the fan of this series SO BEAUTIFUL woah Okay but hear me out What if Dokja is the author of TWSA but he doesnt know yet Dokja might not be the protagonist of TWSA but he sure is worthy to be the protagonist of this web comic Super epic episode omg Ah it brought me to tears how the constellations helped him  the writing is top tier dear lord I got so many shivers from this dang this was honestly amazing to read I feel almost a part of it lol This is so beautiful  dude this would be so epic if it was animated king of a kingless world kim dokja  Im speechlessDokja sacrifice the constellations helping him just a beautiful lovely chapter I remember when dokja was just s guy in the office who loved reading that book DOKJAA THIS CHAPTER IS INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL IM ABOUT TO CRY AGAIN WITH SO MUCH HAPPINESS WITHIN MEnTHE FEELS BRO THE FEELS I was really trying to ignore the silly translation but thats itWTF IS THE KING OF THE WORLD WITHOUT A KING IF YOU DONT CHANGE IT RIGHT NOW IMMA SLAP SOMEONE WITH YJHngimme my King Of A Kingless World back like  im amazed at this fanbase people have a good eye for mistakes in the translation AND IM AMAZED AT THE END OF THIS EPISODE SKDHDLFJKD DOKJA WHAT ON EARTH JUST HAPPENED I honestly would love it more if they translated it to King of a Kingless World cause that would be more memorable Ok but the fact that Dokja is the definition of Good eveningGod has let me live another day and im making it EVERYBODYS problem Now thats a fable I can enjoy A king in a World without a King Catchy lets see where this King can go on his grand crusade I was gonna read the next chapter but I just had to reread this one and the chills remain intact aldjaldjsjdjd ah yes king of a kingless world the most powerful fable to have ever existed Dark Dimension Nah it sounded cooler when it referred to them as Eldritch Ooh the first probability storm Truthfully Dokja is probably the only one other than Junghyuk or Sooyung who could even survive it right now And the first Fable now this was the moment things changed Holy shit thatsIuh its amazing i am so in love with this story Woahh I am left speechless This was beautiful woohoodokjaaa soo coool WELL USE THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP The Constellations all jumping in there at the end to protect our boy was just so beautiful That was the most incredible chapter Ive ever read This story is VERY interesting I cant wait to see how the story unfolds THAT WAS DOPE So whats his story he wanted to tell holy hell I have goose bumps this episode was so insane new fable baby Those constellations are homies for sharing the probability wow i finally catched up  Doesnt this mean Dokja is himself a constellation now Or has the potential to become one WowI love this comic in general for its world building art and story but this is the first time Dokja has seemed so heroic vs pragmatic as he was willing to risk death for the slight chance the world could be saved And the stars setting sail chills I dont really understand what just happened but Dokja is like a legend now right That was amazing Feels like a new arc will begin soonits going get even more epic isnt it if yall think this is good just you wait it gets even better This was full and completely serious Dokja Shit actually got real Im stunned by this episode What a chapter  the birth of a fable Im kinda sad they stick to fables when they already used stories before but OK ahh Im crying I love this so much Dokja YOU ACTIVATED MY TRAP CARD BALD ARMY GENERAL IM SRRYWKSKDJJD LETS GO KING Dokja became a legend in his own right this chapter The artwork was dope as always  Wow I really love this webtoon Dokja being the King of the Kingless and what he did is really cool I cant wait to see how else he will surprise me in the future my fav manwha of all time THE LIMBS I WOULD SELL JUST TO WATCH THIS ANIMATED The constellations could have benefited from their incarnations getting the Fable But they still chose to share Dokjas pain because they support what he did  NOW THIS IS THE KIND OF WEBTOON THAT DESERVES TO BECOME A MOVIE OR A SERIES King of a Kingless World sounds way more badass ngl Goosebumps and sadness when Dokja said he only has one shot at his ending THIS IS SO GOOD MY FAVORITE STORY EVER Im in love with every single one of these characters my heart and mind is racing This is what I want to do Im in love with everything about this Thank you wow this story never ceases to amaze me i got tearyeyed when the constellations shared the burden and moore tearyeyed when dokja achieved something unfathomable i felt so proud favorite story on webtoon rn  This chapter was amazing I usually never leave comments on webtoon but this will be my first since 2 years of using webtoon This was amazing it left a great impact and I believe the story is progressing beautifully This was a BOMB chapter  Dokja be snatching constellations left and right A king indeed Danm The constellations certainly have a favorite XD THIS IS A MASTERPIECE Yall I couldnt wait for the updates so I read the translated comic online When I caught up to that I read the entire web novel it took me two weeks filled with endless laughter and tears Its long but written the way youd read a webtoon I highly suggest fans read the novel to get your fix PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SOMEONE ANIMATE THIS SERIES King of a kingless word sounds much better A world without king Cheesy af please change it to king of the kingless world it sounds much cooler and thats how it is in novel plus ruler of dark dimension outer god make it this way it will make sense in future one of the memorable chapters Yellow box I assume this means it is a higher ruling authority than the system used to create the blue boxes Remember when this was just killing bugs Ive been here since episode one and damn things change so quick This chapter was amazing Time to go get some free coins I cant handle this cliffhanger The fact that Dokja got basically all the constellations on his side and created a new fable is really something It really shows you dont need a sponsor to win the favour of the constellations the constellations are actually seeming to be pretty good now huh I NEED MORRE i needed a moment for that to sink in i was just sitting staring unblinkingly at my screen not even reading the top comments that i had just scrolled to applause for the author i was literally speechless Thank god the constellations intervened My respect for them increased I very much enjoyed this King of the world without a king oof King of a Kingless world sounded better Either way some dope shit coming up The King of the world without a king I still prefer the King of a Kingless World I hope they dont change the names like what happened in the translation in the novel in between cause its going to be a mess And the Outer Gods too Sigh Anyways but still I LOVE THIS SCENE Yes its the beginning Its starting Though Im 8 chapters ahead in the Manhwa Still I support Lezzgo A mysterious ruler sees his chance in this world now whos this Every chapter of this Webtoon is a gem This chapter gave me literal chills The fact that the constellations heard his wish for how he wanted to change the story and rewrite it theyre invested and they are looking out for him Thats such a big feat To have the constellations following your story Man dokja and his gang really came through Yall what just happened I want to read the original TWSA just to compare it to this cause I feel like the significance about some of this stuff is downplayed by our lack of knowledge of how things should be going in the original TWSA and how the world works meaning the story in the first world should have ended when he takes the throne so dokja managed to not end the story in the first world therefore no regression therefore part 2 I was astonished enthralledhappy scared bewilderedProud throughout the chapter A total package Kim Dokjawhat a amazin character he is AHH I WISH I HAVE MORE COINS I CANT WAIT dokja went to so many places did so many things but at the end is still wearing a jacket give my mam some clothes please  The plot is amazing the characters are amazing the art is amazing just everything about this Webtoon is absolutely amazing what a great name King of the world without a kingI was waiting for it from novel Wowthis actually made me speechless for a bit Even with some mistranslations even with a bit of the mistranslations this chapter WAS SO GOOD yall are complaining about translations and stuff but its still a dope ass novel just enjoy it just remembered where has Gilyeong been this whole time its just soo cool the power of storytelling saving a story and having the viewer save you a story gains its power from what its readers want the levels the layers ough Damn Dokja really willing to die for this T T cant help but love these constellations for supporting Dokja got bit teary there Cant wait to see whats next oo This episode is gorgeous The art the story Just wow i do hope this gets an anime cause the scene in this episode with all the constellations is BEAUTIFUL Oohh did yall notice that the title got rain drop stains Please listen to the people who say that King of a Kingless World is better because King of a world without a king is quite possibly the worst thing to say and read in the history of reading and writing my heart stopped for a moment I thought this was the end  It looks impressive to me that Dokja was willing to die or at least suffer a tremendous pain just for the sake of saving the world That is Just awesome I am so grateful to the author for giving us such a beautiful funny epic and tragic story It has been a long time since I havent loved a fiction that intensely Thank you so much I cant wait to see what is in store outside Seoul now Favorite episode so far in Omniscient Reader WOW BEST CHAPTER THAT LAST LINE IS SOOO GOOD Dude This has me cryING SO good  just caught up finally im gonna be spending a lot of money on this comic arent i A new constellation has joined the star stream The constellation Destinys Requiem gazes in wonder upon the incarnation Dokja Kim The constellation Destinys Requiem deeply approves of the incarnation Dokja Kims actions thus far You have received 25 coins yo is our boy Dokja gonna start building up enough fables to become a constellation And this is the moment where everything begins  if you havent yet I totally recommend finding and reading the novel to this If youre enjoying the manga youll love the novel so does that mean Dokja is being made into a protagonist now Dokja youre a handsome bachelor incarnation why are you so surprised youre popular My poor ass is sponsoring you 5 coins a week too Kinda wish it was story rather than fable but amazing feat nonetheless The Constellation Child of the Chaotic Mask is stunned by what has transpired 5 Coins have been giftedSeriously though WTF just happened Does this mean Dokja has earned the right to become a Constellation himself The last panel the message this whole chapterThe dang onion cutting ninjas are back  the last pics he looks so beautiful  Man this is so cool wtf Something about the constellations taking pity on a human and sharing the burden almost made me tear up  he looks so pretty in the last panel Reading this gave me chills that I rarely experience Good job Author You made a good WebToon THE GOOSEBUMPS READING THIS CHAPTER and i much prefer calling the fable King of a Kingless World just because it sounds cooler that way 33 So we aint gonna talk about how Dokja looks so beautiful in that position or im just stupid and a simp in the last panel i mean i can stare at it for hours mind blown rn ngl dokja be lookin pretty sexy in that last panel BEAUTIFULL CHAPTERR This is supposed to be the official translation why so many changes Like I already dont like it when they change the King of No Killing and some skills now its King of the Kingless Word It kinda ruins the story since names like those are important details Please dont change more than you did already because Im scared that the iconic demon king or  Company or the Sacrificial  will be changed Like at least choose more fitting alternatives if you need to change the translation It made me shed a few tears that Dokja was able to touch the constellations enough for them to decide to share the plausibility with him He changes the people around him damn this chapter was incredible nah this should defiantly get crunchyroll to do anime for this webtoon this is a webtoon where you dont need to fully understand the history cause you learn about it while rooting for these characters i cant stop stressing when dokja does something i think is stupid and win i know he will win but it always make me feel like hell lose this is too good to not get a anime that last panel 3 dokja my king of a kingless world CHILLS hopefully this manhwa will get at least the same amount of chapters as TWSA Why did the constellation of the prisoner of golden band didnt help woah love this chapter this webtoon is probably one of the best ive ever read Woah i got the chills This is so beautiful dokja is so dope How does this series keep getting better and better the more imposible you think it is  ive come a long way but i still dont know the difference between plausibility and probability can someone enlighten The art is so majestic This is so damn good Thank you authornim and artistnim and Webtoon of course for having this Such a great quality platform to read an exquisite manhwa  this is much way better than Solo leveling The art soo beautifull i never forget to save some panel and make it my phone wallpaper  this panel is chefs kiss This I too am watching Well damn that was incredibly touching and poetic This was so uniquiely poetic HYPE HYPE HYPE REALLY LOVED THE HYPED CREATED IN THIS CHAPTER DANG This was on of those beast episodes where Dokja just showed us how OP the omniscient reader powers in the right hands are Dang  Throne go poof HOLY PIECE OF PIZZA THIS CHAPTER GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS ALL OVER Oo MA LORD I CANT dokja has some  This brings the feels man omg the cons are so nice Its so heartwarming that Dokja has won the hearts of the constellations Congratulations you have achieved a non existing achievement this is me but NEVER wait so youre telling me this isnt the end of a season That chapter sure fit perfect as one final anime first or second season that was so epic why am i crying i dont even know what feeling this is what chapter is this in novel Please change king of a world without a king to the original king of a kingless world There is an END why are you going to END the story v  shocks this episode is just sooo good Damn this was so cool This webtoon is amazing You are an unbelievable author  last chap many protect him this chap the constellation too i love it sm  cant wait for next chap yeah time to continue its webnovel So Im suppose to wait for like 500 episodes cuz in the novel its more than 500 no problem  Im good at waiting I love the depiction at the end very into the spider verse with its message And f that dokkebi NO WAY HES CONSTELLATION NOW Ayo I didnt wanted to read the novel because I have over 10 novels lined up waiting to be finished but now I am very intrigued and I can not wait for the next chapter so Im gonna go and read it I got goosebumps NOO I WANT TO READ MOREE11 Rn i just wanna cry idk why I hope we get an explanation why the dokkaibi is so EXTREMELY pissed meanwhile Im worried that dokja already changed the story so much that hes gonna become a character and loose the 3 person protection im literally crying this art and story is amazing Whoa  chills ahh im so emotional he finally got first fable now this is where things really begin Note it almost almost cried I literally stoped it haha HOLY SHIETYT I GOT CHILLSS As a reader of the web novel this chapter and the whole series was pure gold I wish they went with outer gods instead of rulers of the dark dimension though in their translation though Easily one of the best if not the best chapter so far This chapter was epic  This just rose up to my top three fave webtoons quicker than Dokja can think goosebumps fucking goosebumps this arc is AWESOME Thank you constellations Thank you King of a Kingless World is where its at Im surprised many comments are saying the same l YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW BUMPY MY SKIN FEELS RN IM HAVING GOOSEBUMPS FOR THE PAST 3 MINUTES this chapter is fantastic god I love this so much The constelation daughter of a broken dream is looking forward the next chapter 5 coins have been gifted I REMEMBER SEEING THAT SWORD IN A KDRAMA SO THATS WHAT IT IS Literally got chills this chapter Cant wait to see where the series will go I bow my head in respect Damn Dokja back at your suicidal tendencies I see Amazing ep dokja is amazing That was so epic What a great payoff of all these separate interactions coming together loved this chapter This scene hit me in the feels so hard Let see what story this new fable will make King of the World Without a King love that last visual This is literally taking your destiny by the hand bro some of these comments forget that this isnt their webtoon story to make  Waaoo this was unexpected Him turning into a fable possible a constellation if Im not wrong what an awesome success Kxnskfnwkdbws The last page was so beautiful Its sad how dokja took so much burden but amaizing how so many constellations started to support him from far away Is Dokja going to become a Constellation specifically the Constellation King of a Kingless World One of the best episodes so far this is the best webtoon ive ever read I much prefer Star Relic over Constellation Artifact The later may be accurate but the former just rolls off the tongue better Considering what they use to fight in this story I think its better to condense what you can Future fight scenes are going to be quite a mouthful as is which is why I also agree with the top comments i cant even begin to say how much feelings this comic gives me this is illegal Why not just keep using King of a Kingless World It sounds a lot better I want to see it animated iis this what has become of the comments section now disputing translations i smell a end of season cliff hanger coming soon The Fable The King of the world without a king is one of my favorite story What a great chapter This webtoon never fails to amaze me dude just turned into a god without expecting Soo did he became a constellation Will he be his own sponsor I like how the title is smudged by raindrops A small but nice feature to match the scenery this chapter unironically gave me chills wow AA Dokja sweetie you really are a king arent you boy It was so heartwarming when all the constellations started helping Dokja  just amazing nice plot twist there D this is just too good very good for my heart  and here starts dokjas endless selfsacrificing nature that will piss junhyeok off ughh i just got goosebumps didnt think it would be possible with a webtoon ADFHJ Ngl this has been my favorite chapter so far Basically Dokja is breaking the entire game and i feel like this is just the beginning the goosebumps everytime  I got literal chills when the constellations all teamed up to share the burden dayummm Dokja  im obsessedd omygoshhh ladies and gentlemen hes broken the game The constellations are rooting for him Wowim speechless Wow this was epic Well done very well made Can we all agree that Dokja is a boss Here comes the Kingless World did dokja become a fabled constellation this story is just the best its my favorite everything is unpredictable you did well author  could someone explain plausibility please me no get it  This series just jumped from a high 8 to a high 9 or solid 10 which means imma reread the shit out of this I liked the dokabei before this one hes not even cute goosebumps all over the place in this chapter i loved every part of this whole chapter woow just wow I dont understand what is a fable Damn this is so good  I cant wait for the 5th scenario it will surely flood with comments  Goosebumps on that last scene this is super good This chapter is just chef kiss Holy sht that was amazing wait did he become a constellation but he should be a mythical not fabeled or whatever the most powerful one is he deserves to be at the top I hope he can make his way up still YEAH DOKJAA UR SO BADASS WOOHOO king of a kingless world is such a better title its the original translation from the novel The translation feels so bad It is in consistent there is complete lack of flow every name feels clunky and forced i starting to think that some trash translator company was hired to translate this webtoon it is has level of some intern who is non native english speaker which finished his education in middle school NO they changed it from King of a Kingless World TT man its annoying how many mistakes are made in these translations Holy craap it just gets better and better Good job to all the people working on this masterpeice WOO This story is so wonderfully done Dokja has gone from being a reader who never chose to be anything more to someone willing to give everything up to tell the story he wants told Beautiful writing dokja look thicc in the last panel  Honestly Im at my wits end with Webtoon translators Its getting progressively worse As a novel reader I cringe at many of the choices theyve made Ruler of the dark dimension No its Outer God King of the World without a King FFS NO King of a Kingless World goosebumps seeing this scene drawn was amazing I want to read novel BUT its way TOO long and I have VERY short patience  KING OF A WORLD WITHOUT A KING LETS GOO King of a Kingless World sounds much better tbh kinda wish whoever was translating this took some liberties Sure what was said was accurate but it certainly does not roll off the tongueEither way pog Fable 1 acquired Dojka managed to exceed my expectations once again  and the constellations helping him almost made me tear up tbh DDormamu This had me in tearsIt was so breathtaking And How is anyone even going to survive through the scenario if they havent read This is basically made so that no one survives right Somehow seeing the boxes turn gold because yellow doesnt sound as god looks so satisfying  They are looking at you  Ah the Stars have Alligned or have they Me this WEBTOON has over 60 episodes should keep me busy a whileMe two days later time to start spending some coins Not regretting spending 5 coins on this chapter  Im glad I spent my hard earned 5 coins  thats some END OF SEASON ONE shit right there wtf  This whole comic has just escalated in such a fantastic way When I started reading I would have never imagined the journey this story would take me on would be so amazing At this point I have no idea what will happen next but Im excited to find out bro that was the best chapter yet omfg  Yo this is SO FING GOOD I dont think this episode is worthy of 5 coin like this ep is so heart warming and emotional I love this comic sooo much the extremely pissed off look of the White furry two horned gremlins face when Dojka was pretty much saying fck off I do what I want was funny as HELL but someone please take the time to read this and answer my few questions that I got cuz I didnt understand why the White furry gremlin was mad as HELL about the throne situation and I have a few questions to ask yall so please go and look at the questions in the replies sections some one please help Its so good This is right up there with my favorite episode episode 40 I have absolutely no regrets spending coins on this Webtoon Damn it is so good this webtoon is the reason im broke and honestly i dont regret a thing Take all of the coins I have Im reading this like a movie and imagining it as such Goosebumps at the end of this episode cant wait for the next one im so happy I put coins into this I love this comic so much the story keeps getting better and thrilling thank you I love this part so much but the name King of a Kingless World Gosh that was so amazing I too would like to see the end that Kim Dokja wants  Wait are we seeing what I think we are seeing A new fable has been created and the name the king of a world without kings does this mean Dokja is becoming a constellation himself or am I reading too much into this THAT WAS EPIC wow Im in awe  Im really curious how redice would interpret this chapter into drawing format and initially I thought they will do it in grand amazing and wow art like in other manhwas when the MC achieve something big but they use emotional approach instead and while it can be a lil bit underwhelming for me it just fits well in this chapter context especially when you already know what this chapter really is about and its implications it made this chapter 999 times more sadder I fast passed all the way here and I dont regret it one bit when the constellations shared burden of plausibility with dokja I almost shed a tear that was so goood I cant wait to see see the art with the story its such a good story and just keeps getting better This episode was awesome truly deserving the name of a fable The last two chapters gave me chills Absolutely stunning I am in awe This is such a fantastic story I cant wait for the rest  This episode was amazing I got chills I have school in like 5 hours spent probably 30 coins I have no regrets but Id have to wait longer for new chapters YESS IT IS YOUR STORY LET THEM KNOW DOKJA literally got chills when reading a new fable was created been such a long time since a story could get such a reaction from me well done author and artist and translater Im obessed with this I love it Everything in this chapter was priceless and utterly awesome long live to the King of the kingless world  Wow our eyes are on you too Dokja Share with us the story you so desperately wish to tell SO FUCKING BADASS Kim Dokja destroyed the Absolute Throne with the same energy as Drogon melting the Iron Throne in GoT he almost got me in the first half not gonna lie i really thought dokja was gonna die for a second there the constellations are so nice Im on the edge of my seat like holy cow Why is this not a anime already Im really tired of the top comments being people complaining about the translation i am bankrupt and selling my children for this webtoon i hope this isnt the end Constellations Why take the hard road when theres an easier oneDokja Hey wait Im not dead yet my mans really said if you cant beat them join them and became a fable Was it just me or this was a REALLY GOOD chapter I have bought almost every single episode that was come out this story is just too good almost cried bruh GAHHHD DAMN  favorite chapter so far this should seriously get an anime adaptation but idk how id handle waiting for each season THIS IS TOO GOOD The Constellation Unproductive Reader is looking at Incarnation Kim Dokja dang do yall see that azz He has a big ass SHIII this is SO GOOD not usually one for action fantasy stories but holy balls this gave me so much goosebumps Its been so long since Ive found a good story that makes want to binge read or continue reading no matter what Im doing OOHOO AGORA SIM AS COISAS COMEAM A FICAR SRIAS This chapter is my favorite that Ive read so far just because of how the constellations share his pain of plausibility Its just this moment when they seems to regain their humanity and and really using him as a driving force to win this game once and for all WOW I am speechless Im pretty sure that its suppose to be King of a Kingless World one of my fav episode 3 i almost cried when the constellations shared his burden TT damn this feels like a cinematic masterpiece is this chapter a joke like its too amazing to be true king of a kingless world this chapter was so good my heart just went  when the constellations were sharing the burden I GOT A PHYSICS EXAM TOMORROW AT 7AM AND ITS ALREADY 4AM TF  PRAY FOR ME This is only the beggining Buckle up folks The constellations warned him clear enough you will die because of it but kdj answered thats my decision to make I like how fearless kdj is but at the same time I despise him for betting on his life so easily because the people around him surely fear his death And me too You should value your life more kdj OH MY GOD DOKJA The attention to detail Water droplets on the title page  Can someone explain to me what had happened So the world ended but he is born again Im very confused this has to be my favorite episode so far Whered secretive plotter go that constellation is usually the most active one you insignificant worm  Well you petty defected teddybear dont you dare say that to Dokja Am I crying YES I AM CRYING THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL a new fable was created for him  I stg Iam falling too hard for this man  This was beautiful  I like how the top comments were critiques in the grammar and not about how much more emotionally deep and thought provoking this Episode was Yes Im sure they also believed that it was deep but still no need to point out things that arent that significant when it still gives off the same feel if it was translated slightly different Bro This Episode was absolute fire Personally I dont really see why people have a problem with the text It still means the same thing  this chapter tho  This episode is so good Man my heart is literally racing in excitement This is this is incredible hes so attractive at the end goosebumps dokja i love u HOLYY This was so beautiful I want to cry WOAH ohhh Also this would be the perfect moment to end the season but they still moved on mm damn damn this chapter when i first read it gave me chills running through my whole body cuz of how good it was I deffinetly feel the Dokabies will realise eventually how Dojka is able to know what he is doing and has the knowledge of what could be happening in the future I have no idea whats happening but that was cool lol bruh the last panel are just my tears dropping down the screen honestly I thought that he was gonna use his king attribute after it killed him and get back up for a small comedic moment alternatively this feels a little power of friendshipish but at the very least It makes some sense King of a kingless world has a better ring and its shorter which emphasizes the irony The king of a kingless world sounds way better Bald Army General this chapter was badass and cool to see comstellations help Dokja dokja Bro this is literally the coolest comic of ALL TIME GOD THAT STAR SCENE WAS AMAZING I need to read this episode again everything was too good  The king of the world without a king fits him so well The constellation 33pandaGamer is exploding

the implications If they make this webtoon story a movie Ill surely watch it I want an anime of this so much Okay that episodewas DOPE I cant believe the Four Yin Demon Decapitator became an Constellation Artifact This episode has such an amazing translation This gave me freaking shivers man  so Dokja became a fable and therefore sort of like a constellation by the way i thught taht the other country had a throne too why this make it sound like it is only in koreaedit to answer yes i know that but if the other have a throne too whats the use of removing one the outer god will still be connected to the planet i red the book too but i never got that part I dont get why the final panel is upside down tho WTF MAN THAT WAS THE MOST WHOLESOME THING EVER W THE CONSTELLATIONS IMMA CRY Dude is Dokja a constellation now THAT WAS SO GOOD HE SEEMS TO BECOME THE MAIN CHARACTER HERE omg the way I got goosebumps holy i love how almost i guess all of the constellations subsided dokjas pain dammn i love this webtoon so much  Everything that hes doing Everything he believes and fights for I think Dokja will become a Constellation in his own right This is amazing beyond words bro I legit got goosebumps at the ending Give me shivers man we know who is the constellations favorite idky but i got a bit emo here he must have been really passionate about this story when he was reading it he really changed it to how he would have wanted it Dokja created a new Fable does this mean that he now transcends higher than a normal humans with lower constellations Well maybe Im wrong cause being an origin of a fable doesnt make one its main protagonistBut we all know that hes the main protagonist of this story anyway so No words Just Wow Youd think this would be part of a finale but theres still more Swag Daamn i got goosebumps now that was a solid conclusion This webtoon never ceases to amaze me its just godly King of a Kingless World Aaaa Here me out Read this episode with music I hold you by Clann Hits different Especially the ending damn this ep grabbed me by the neck and threw me against a wall My heart is beating so fast how can I wait another week Just another great episode I love the plot twists and even though he seems to know everything you can also see him struggle which makes him seem more relatable I just love every episode ty Wooow What a chapter It must become a anime OMG Im really impressed that was a perfect chapter thank you so much  What a beautiful chapter EPIIC Dokjas Ascension begins now I got SHIVERS Ill miss it so so much this was the best Ive ever read The art the story it gave me goosebumps It was so good I reread this more times then I can count so basically 10 times Bruu the art is so beautiful this chapter  I really liked this masterpiece ConstellationsExMachina aw man the translation is the king of the world without a king huh king of a kingless world sounded so much cooler though this episode is so amazing  This Constellation falls more in love with the story as it continues Infinite pride and affection overwhelms us Is Dokja going to die I dont know why but I felt like tapering up when constellations started to look upon Dokja DOKJA IS A LEGEND WBK you did well dokja HOLY IS DOKJA A FABLE NOW I AM IN LOVE Hol up remember yall how Constellations are ranked from Historic then Rare Mythical and the Ultra Rare Fables Dokja just became the newest FableThe King of the World Without a King I remember the other chapter where a constellation wanted him to promise that when he got to pick a constellation next to pick him WELL how about now Dokja IS the newest Constellation and a FABLE at that too I wonder what his powers will be too The constellation Giver of chocolate chipped circles stares down at the new fable created A cookie is sponsored as a bonus This here is one of my most favored moments in the Novell Can someone please explain what the burden of plausibility is oh my gosh this is so interesting Is this only half of the story I dont want it to end yet  This sht is as good as a movie my god AHH My heart is pounding OUT of my chest THIS IS EPICC Cant wait for next episode his first fable  is this where theyre gonna teleport to diff locations now Well that was something And it was something AWESOME hm would love a bunch of constellations to share some of my burdens my god this is so badass The king of a world without a king immeditially made me think of Viva La Viva song for some reason A twist I didnt see coming and a fantastic wrap to this story arc Beautiful thats all I have to say WHOA WHOA WHOAA The plot and everything overall is just Chefs kiss the last panel was fabulous but i also loved that the title looked like some rain drops had fallen on it OMG WHAT A GREAT CHAPTER He cant die tho Wow the constellations shared the burden with him Amazing Team with Crunchyroll and make this an anime already That was so fucking cool I got goosebumps dang mind blown So he just died ahh the last panel hes so hot omg You are special You are loved epic Ah sunfish is deciding not to regress King of the World without King is good but I still hope that they keep the original King of the Kingless World naw what is up with these translations bring back king of a kingless world  it sounds so much more epic Cam just talk about how Dokja now has two constellation class weapon with the new onefour yin demon decapitated being able to serve the link between a constellation thats just overpower and now Dokja has it I hope others survive is all Im saying After reading this chapter I remember a certain quote in the back of my mind Dokja destroying the throne and Constellations watching has made him leave a strong legacy in changing everything Their world their fate and their future It is this quote that became the representation of what Dokja stand for so that people will not lose hope in their darkest hour This is Dokjas legacy This is where your story begins Will Dokja end up becoming a constellation himself The constellations gave him a title and even a fable about Dokja was created it seems he might atleast achieve something similar to a constellations level of power even if he doesnt become a constellation That was fantastic great job WTF why am i crying while the constelations look ay dokja screw this i love this story Idk but Kim Dokja looks oddly beautiful in the last panel  wait so dat man is a fable now this story just keeps on climbing and I am loving it Huh none of the usual constellations were helpingUriel Son Wu Kong ect You beautiful bitch Omg is Dokja gonna become a constellation I I almost thought Dokja will become a constellation Yknow that Kim Dokja will always take the hard routes Easy aint always the best Damn it felt legendarily cool and satisfying No Dokja is not a constellation now Incarnations can achieve fables from my understanding with enough fables achieved and certain conditions met an incarnation can become a constellation maybe wait I think the constellations who were giving him coins did not join in  i really like the details such as the end title being covered in raindrops on the paper it is written on This chapter was something else Anyone got the link to the light novel Im not doing so good I used my coins to unlock the episode but in doing so I cant unlock the next one NOO this webtoon

culture that I would call secret knowledgeYou know like in many Japanese games you would profit a lot from knowing smth from guides outside of the game Or if youre playing it a second time And like that in this scenario there was nothing from which you couldve come to conclusion that the throne is so dangerous It was totally indeductible from prior knowledge I want to know what does the author usually mean by constellations As sometimes even the stars are mentioned as a constellation like in this chapter At this pint theres on right for Junghyeok yu to be the hero of TWSA he always sleeping find everything is ready Dojka is working so hard I want to fight  any one saying hes not hot he is so handsome and cute sometimes Chills man THANKS AUTHOR IM SO EXCITED FOR THE NEXT CHAPS Im sorry but Im literally flipping out at how cool this chapter wasLIKE DAMNN That was incredible    Youre a Constellation Harry Huh I mean Dokja man i thought this comic was gonna end So cool  Oh wow that is awesome The king of the world without a king Thats a nice title to it Lets get ready for PART 2 wowwe this week episode is so hypppee Damn that was beautiful BRO CHILLSSS Wow I didnt even realize I was holding my breath throughout the whole chapter till now I am in so much awe damn that was beautiful dokkaebi principal thought he can fail Dokja in test But fortunately hes indirectly sponsored by benefactors like constellations Also Lord of dark dimension Dormammu wishes not to mess with KDJ Wow this chapter gave me so much goosebumps so good This story seems to just get better and better Next week cant come soon enough That was pretty friggin metal I Flipping Love this story Fucking what My jaw is on the floor How does this story just keep getting better every episode yes you get the right feeling about this its something Very big KD sure is a King nice Title RIP King of a Kingless World This chapter was pretty much a grand movie ending I love this comic Cant wait to read more omg i just noticed that this is barely chp 15 isnt the novel like 500  very tempted to read it Three Ways To Survive The Apocalypse could this be one of the ways Could the title actually indicate the web novel was meant to serve as a guide to actually ending the apocalypse Do these three specific but insanely hard tasks and the world will not end This was one of the most satisfying episodes so far its like the ending or not quite ending of a movie when the good guys win i thoroughly enjoyed it Damn that last panel gave me goosebumps could everyone see the Golden screen at the end or only mc Holy shit  Omg OMG Wheres Paimon Now he has a fable the other constellations are gonna be trying to sponsor him so hard lol i genuinely believe this is my favorite chapter so far The EPICNESS  Ohhh This Was So POWERFUL My emotions are a mess  internally screaming So since hes a fable that means in order for his story to be a legit there can be no regressions bc everyone in the story is supposed to only live once to make it a whole and true story Will he become a constellation then when he dies Damnit it seems its finally time for me read the LN I need to understand what this means Holy HELL that was EPIC The translation is killing me but I hope it gets to improve in later chapters tho look at dokja at the last panel hes such a beautiful man THAT WAS SO COOL WTH AA KING SHIT every week i come here and internally scream my head off about how cool dokja is that one time a fanmade story is more interesting than the real ones I absolutely love how the main character has planned everything and the payoff of just watching the main character carry out the plan is amazing Kudos to the people who made this you did amazing dude sorry Im so stupid but what do they mean bythe burden of plausibility could someone explain please This was AWESOME   does this mean his story was becoming a fable  GIVMME THE NEXT EPISODE IM OBCESSED WITH THIS BUT IM BROKE That was touching  Holy shit The writing and art continues to amaze me Praise those Constellations Lots of things he did change the storyline but this this right here change everything He literally change the gameplan dokkaebi has plan out Wow The king of the world without a king So impressive This webtoon never has any lows wow this episode was not only beautiful artistically but also had a cool story with the constellations sharing his plausibility and stuff dont you hate it when you try imagining how your body being shredded apart feels like but then you start throwing up Came back for a reread Waitis he a king now Thats awesome currently reading Ch 464 of the Novel its so incredible  YOO THIS IS SICK EVERY EPISODE MAKES MY HEART EXITED BRO I MIGHT GET A DISEASE King of a kingless world Dojka u smart cookie u question for those that have read the ink and paper are we nearing the end of the story or is this like the end of the beginning No Gods or Kings only men i dont know what to expect thats what this webtoon does to me dokja i am the master of my own fate no matter the outcome HYPE Goosebumps Constellations be like  nirvanamoebius god dokja big dipper Ive come to bargain that last panel absolutely gorgeous  Ddid Did he just become a constellation the constilation if the big diaper is my favorite constilation irl i look at it every night HOLY FREAKING CRAP THIS CHAPTER 10010 rating the was great aa dokja finally got his first great fable Ok but the water droplets on the name So the reason Dokja destroyed the throne is that if he sits on it this world ends So only the one who sat on it will go to the next regression and everyone else die except Jung hyeok since hes the main char of the world Am i understanding this right Man that was insane I legit thought he was gonna die I just have one word for this whole serie WOW Ong that was so cool cant wait for the next part and king of the world without a king is cool I wonder how much coins he will get or how mad the cute thing will be WHAT JUST HAPPENED did he just become a fabled constellation Beautiful chapter Very awesome Super curious to see where the story goes now that this capture the flagget the throne scenario seems to be ending Idk what just happened but it was cool This is the second time ive cries reading this ep is so good  And now the true story begins Im calling it now Dokja is a constellation and the story he read was just his future self somehow This gave me CHILLS It was worth more than 5 coins thats for sure Yall when I say I screamed I literally screamed THIS EP WAS THE BEST BY FAR So in case of something theres a chance dokja can be a constellation now that hes a fable But ofc for him to succeed that cant happen its a little thought I had while readingomg Im so excited for whats coming like this is setting more new boundaries i am crying this is mind blowing i am stunned I feel overwhelmed with the support that Dokja has recieved in the previous ep and this one too It ist just fucking amanzing what an absolute king no Im not sorry The constellations trust in Dokja is unbeatable ooo I got chills from that This story gets better and better So amazing Definitely worth the free 5 coins and the 2 weeks wait to see the king of the kingless world bit King of a kingless world runs off the tongue better in my opinion What an amazing addictive beautiful comic So so good They should have

my love and appreciation for this story i love Dokja dearly Omg the king of the world without a king fits so well Nooo when he coughs blood just noo imagine if the world just ended then and there

so much better than this Translations do not always have to be very literal If the words match the context and sound better then the translation is deemed accurate Im seeing people complain about translation Screw you This story is so freaking good Im so excited that Dokja is now part of a Fable which is a higher rank than several of the Constellations he has called upon  HOLY FUVKING SHIP YO THAT WAS FANTASTIC He has created a New World Order GO DOKJA DO THE THING YOU SPUNKY MANGAREADER YOU AN ABSOLUTE KING Constellation Dragon of the Peach Tree is looking at Dokja Kim bro is still wearing his sneakers or whatever the brand is called that has stars and BALLS on the shoes I dont want to become king so I become king of world without king Mans just teleported to Australia in that

WHY AM I CRYING one of the best moments Ive seen in webtoon OMG DAMN MY DUDE GOT SOMEWHERE NEAR 15 CONSTELLATIONS LOOKING AT HIM That was epic It would be nice to know significance of items and core goals and the plans to achieve them Currently we are being told significance of everything as something happens There is no suspension as we can hear item X having hidden function that solves a problem we just learned about You could replace the sword with toothbrush and revelation would work the same way DOKJA TE PASASTE DE MADRES NMMSSS COMO TE AMO HDP HOLY WOW THAT CHAPTER JUST BLEW ME

Does this mean hell become a constellation when he dies 66 if constellations are made through people remembering their story since the Big Dipper swore to remember him does that make him a Constillation to be The art and the scans and translate words of this episode is beautiful there  this comic oh my god take everything i have so freaking cool I feel impressed and respectful towards dokja definetly a main character  Hes a Barbie Girl who isnt living in his Barbie World MY SWEAT IS COLD AS ICE BUCKET IM INTERNALLY SCREAMING JRHDHDUEYDYSYDUJDHHDBDVDBSHSHSJSNSNDHDGDGDSYSH The Kingdom Hearts music I listen to while I read this comic sure did sync beautifully with this scene king of the world without a king has a beautiful meaningin ancient time the king will be someone from the royal family they have to have the connection with the king and for this scenario Dokja would be a king if he had the throne of a different king but he didnt want to get that which is tied with another king nHe wanted to tell that he will be someone who can fulfill the dutys of a King and also can gain the respect of other kings without the help of another king n WAIT DID HE LIKE UHM BECAME A CONSTELLATION OR SOMETHING dokjaa wow AMAZING  I feel like he might come back because when he destroyed the throne now everyone has a chance to actually defeat the next one and in a way he saved them all by doing that and he can come back because he save ppl right  what a chapter  wow the constellations can do that  yeah they already did so why ask haha BRO THIS IS SO COOL woah man listing to 21 savage and key glock while reading this is FUCKING GREAT that was so cool Im glad Im not the only one who was really touched that the constellations shared his burden of plausibility It was so touching TT in the first few panels its such hard work calling these constellations that Dokjas clothes are sweating omg wow gawd dayum the last panel amazing these last few chapters phew too good DID HE BECOME A FABLE HE IS NOT GONNA DIE RIGHT OMG IS HE A CONSTELLATION yes The King Of The World Without A King is the best and very unique title damn the king of the world without a king  Brilliant bro SO FUCKING COOL IF I WAS A CONSTALLATION I WOULD DO THAT FOR MY BOY AS WELL  The risk its exciting to see and he became a king to me it suits him well Is Dokja going to become a fabled constellation Or King without a throne so only Korea have the throne The main character of a World were he is not the main character stealing the main characters titleThe webtoon serie damn We will be watching you THE KING OF THE WORLD WITHOUT A KINGA New FABLE Has Been CreatednnThe Fable THE KING OF WITHOUT A KING Has Been Created Kudos to the artist for doing such a great job for creating this

I loved the storyline and it was amazing I highly recommend this one to become animated It will definitely hit in top list Thank you fucking hell this story is amazing i got chills This episode really made me cry  is it possible if he just take the throne but not use the power of it As he said that if you use the thrones power you will not be able end it so whag if he just dont use it Also wont he

most beautiful chapters in all of manwha THIS IS LITERALLY SO GOOD how based can this man help he hasnt even murdered anyone Typo says that the ruler noticed a chance rather than a change I saw that

uncrowned world CHILLS IM VERY EXCITED TO THIS PART OF THE STORY damn I really love this episode it reallly hyped me up chills for this chap When a new fable is created I somehow got a tear at my eye after reading this in 207 in the morning Philippine timeline btw Ah so the world ends if you use the throne No wonder you cant clear it Sneaky Dokkaebi Dokjas next move was pretty badass So badass he earned the respect of the Constellations It was so touching when they started helping him and eased his paint And that new fable being created  Only Dokja could do the impossible and unexpected so did he become a constellation dokja is so darn pretty for what the fact that so much constellations were helping dokja awww this would literally break everything if it wud be made into an anime and executed WELL KING OF THE WORLD WITHOUT A KINGwow this episode really left me so WOWOWOW did Dokja just get his own constellation Dokja got a fat ass fo sore u200d Kim Donna looks so SEXY How could a new fable be created if he didnt have a constellation unless the part of the contract where it said he couldnt get a supporting constellation unless he died but he did technicality did die but got revived due to king of no killing That is so sick HOLY SHI ok i cried yes King of a Kingless World Damn Dokja what a thick ass you have  This reminds me of the last scene from the 3rd kung fu panda movie where they all hold up their paw and give chi to Po to pull him out of the spirit realm lol HOLY FART NUGGET Wait waitwaitwaitwait DID DOKJA JUST BECOME A CONSTALATION THAT WAS RLLLYYY AWESOOME HHAHAHAH Now what the end Its King of a Kingless World what yall doing doesnt dokja just come back to life I forgot the requirements Does this mean my guy just turned himself into a constellation or

achievement that doesnt even exist  I literally got chills reading this KIM DOKJAA I love love LOVEE this chapter Simply speechless Damn Damn this is so amazing hcbdjxnsjd w he got a nonexisting title xhenjxndjs bruh dont be setting standards This manhwa never cease to amaze me That tho We got the fricken MVP of the entire world here damn if this turned into a kdrama the potential  Im so confused just what happened can someone explain wtf is plausability and fables and why did he destroy the throne This is also cool but I prefer king of a kingless world  hold up is he gonna become a constellation like we said in my country DINGUERIEFrance Wholy shit this is coolest freaking webtoon ever I LITTERALLY CRIED GOD THIS IS INCREDIBLE when i was reading imagining this scene in the novel i cried so much before continuing itthe next chpg hahah TvTand now i see this scene it pained me aurghghhhgh i cant Goosebumps The beginning of next chapter Would have been better if they use a better title like The Uncrowned King just my opinion though That was so satisfying that I had to give a minute of silence and just think about it THIS CHAPTER WAS SO EPIC DOKJA A LEGEND This chapter was so awesome and so heart warming at the same time Chills Goosebumps  dokja you fucking legend damn i cried again Im confused did he just become a fable himself when you do something that breaks the word YOO The Constellations sharing of his burden actually broke me Day 66 of voicing all the characters aand hes starting to make his own story his own constellation  I respect his character Sometimes the protagonist who is said to be the protagonist need not be the one Kim Dokja youre such a main character and I love you bro tht gave me chills woo damn idk about you but this is my most favorite novel webtoon and I freaking need a physical book English version for this kudos to the constellations I wonder what would happen if Junyeok could also see Dokjas point of view everytime he gets beaten unconscious Unlikely to happen cause he doesnt has the matching skill but still just wondering I think I might start reading this WebtoonIll think about it though  my favorite chapter so far the true story will begin here i absolutely love this everything is amazing The constellations helped him Im crying just wow its overwhelming holy crap its raining rn and wow thats really setting the mood omfg this guy is so pretty ion know what everyone else is talking abt  wait what did plausible mean again as someone with English as the third language this webtoon sure has got me pick up a dictionary for words like regression incarnation etc etc  i havent felt so much joy from seeing a character get help in a long time thank you okay cool sad shit and cool awesome story shit but why is not one talking about that dumby  dang I wish I could screen shot king dokja so I can stare at his lovely face as my screen saver tears this chapter got me hype enough to read a little longer Ahhh I loved this chapter 3 O i thought theres no comments you have achieved a nonexisting achievementachievement unlockedWTF 15 squats goddamn kyaa bro thats some insane plot armour I dont know how I feel about this  its filled with sorrow Sorrow I havent felt in awhile  I freaking love this chapter My favorite so far OH NO Awesome Jesus loves you The world without king is more better everyone is free like japanesebut some county maybe destroy because of it epicc love this development PLSS change the translation back to King of a Kingless World it sounds so much better LITERALLY GOT CHILLS So now hes his own constellation King of a abandoned world so touchingIm rooting for you too  This is amazing gahhgg I love it what is the burden of plausibility I didnt see an explanation and it dont make sense to me from context why did he almost die WAIT I DONT UNDERSTAND why would they create a new story my brain is malfunctioning brava what a beautifully written succinct wrap to this plot well done keep up the good work how did he know that so does that mean that he would be the last person to die in this regression Reading this chapter with God Shattering Star playing in the background was an awesome experience So proud of my man Dokja that was amazing I dont understand the plausibility probability thing Hooo I KNEW IT I FACKIN KNEW IT mainly because i was imagining an OC because im not onetrack minded anyways i pretty much guessed this OH MY GOODNESS Constellation Constant Thinking Ocean did a spit take in shock did did Dokja just earn his Constellation title omfg fav chapter so far The constellation Crown of Applpi is looking at Kim Dojka oh man OO I dont understand the plausibility thing but I do love this comic Im not even sure whats happening in the story anymore selfharm colorless by nekobolo and catharsis by aether was such good songs to listen to while reading this chapter That was amazing 00  estaba tan bueno el anterior que me pase este con diccionario en mano they shouldve just stayed with king of kingless world because that sounds so good and badass than whats written above this is so beautiful My mans Dokja actually survived CHILLSS Well done dokja lol why did the change the name GOATED Chapter I read the whole web novel and still never understood why is it so bad for someone to sit on the throne can someone explain what is going on PLEASE nice ass  hj hehehheuntil he does get regression and then he repeats it with The mc of twsa I just realized that I cant spell his name but Im too lazy to go check it Im probably getting ahead of myself tho Dokjaa  How about if the fable would be called Uncrowned king of the world or Worlds uncrowned king  Wait he said he wont need a next regression maybe Sonja has lived three this in the form of how ever many regressions and hes finally gotten this ending the ending he wanted and the outcome he wanted idk if this is possible but my brain had a light bulb moment The King of the World without a King Sink af Isnt the blade supposed to brake after the the throne does But technically he is a king so its not literally a kingless world right If you are confused the translation is a bit shaky King of the world Without a king would basically mean Throneless king I dont know man it seems off to me but besides that this chapter was heat BRUHHH THE CHANGED TRANSLATIONS ERK ME SO NMUCHHDH That was beautiful Seeing all the constellations he ever touched somehow help him out but did he like become a constellation cause fables are the people behind the constellation right im not sure tho sheesh OKAY I SUSPECTED HE WAS AT S POINT THIS COULD HAPPEN BUT IM STILL SUPER JAZZED AMD SUPRUSED ABT IT YESSS Dokja LES LES LES LES LES LES LES GOO Where can I find the finished webtoon Apparently there are loads of chapters published and I cant wait for one per week The King of a World without a King Wow noo if only i had coins Why do I have a bad feeling about this chapter and the ones to come

best and most fun thing Ive done i even made a playlist for this sobs Wow This fable is epic King of a world which is lacking a king Why is the last image upside down King of the world without a king What a cool story Amazingly done I wouldnt ask for more The amount of tmes i have been rolling around is uncountable dont forget hes still an immortal king he cant die The King of the World without a Throne seems more fitting but love this toon W O W Sweetness the constellations all love this man hes a God amongst men by now with his plot armor Constellation MikuLemons has her jaw dropped by the actions of other constellations Remember to like the chapter I get that not much time has passed since this chapter officially released but the like count is half of the last chapters Please dont end it here OML I think the name  A King Of Nothing  would sound better LETS FUKING GOO AHHAHAAHHHAHAA LETS GOO What did it mean by sharing plausibility Chance Im already in chapter 74 but Ill be waiting here till they update  Wow this felt deep but yh I dont know yeo ruler of the dark dimension is and their significance to the story line I read that the were a few mistranslations when the story talks about eastern fables What jut happened can someone explain cause I know it is something serious butt NO THE STORY make it longer and make have a good ending like having a lover D CONSTELLATION OPTIMIST KING IS LOOKING AT YOU Dokja whyy so awesome I like the part how it contained chapter number at last just magnificent That was mindblowing the last panel i cant woah that was incredible Wow  Omaigosh I got goosebumps for like the whole chapterI love this story so much daMNN Well I mean its not like I didnt see it coming but its sad to see a definite death flag for Dokja heck flippin yes Oh dang What a chapter Damn That was fucking beutiful This was awesome But can someone explain what the plausibility is please does this mean he could become a constellation Chills man I got chills damn I got chills when all seven stars spoke at once Did Dokja just destroy the throne of the King in Yellow Hastur Oh no woah GOOSEBUMPS Imagine this animated Chills okay now im crying i got goosebumps Whoa  heyo King of the World without Throne diddid our boy just get the power to become a consolation incredible episode Confidence level 100 goosebumps I got spoilers from when I was reading fanfic from this fandom and was this what I was spoiled about ddid he just become a constellation No truce with kingsnWhen the fable was created it actually got really dusty in here somehow is this the power of a god Single starconstellation I dont think thats how that works Edit to clarify Im referring to the Big Dipper stars each being a constellation Does anyone know if this series source novel are available as published copies for purchase anywhere Definitely want to add this masterpiece to my shelf What a superb chapter Thats an amazing story Suprise us more writernim   Wait so is dokja a fable now WAIT HUH THIS WAS SO BADASS BUT IM SO CONFUSED Oh that was amazing ah yes prologue over now I seriously want to scream because of how awesome dokja is but alas i cannot FR LIKE HOLY SHIT THIS IS SO COOL Dang Dokja just made the impossible possible idk about anyone else but I got major chills from this chapter holy wowza soo Dokja became a Fabled constellation that was his plan all along or he just wanted to cut the tie between the outer gods and this world to give it a better ending than TWSAs hmm Id prefer it if they actually translated the names of each of the stars of the big dipper Like the seven stars are actually called Alioth Dubhe Merak Phecda Megrez Mizar and Alkaid But they also apparently have titles because theyre dieties in korean folklore collectively called Chilseong That was beautiful man This episode was just simply so beautiful Woo The boy got his first Fable  This novel reader is excited to see the next chapters the art is gorgeous especially that last panel of Dokja  truly a wonder tuesday I started cackling like a madman about halfway through this chapter and didnt stop until the end so question did Dokija just die and become a fable constalation or did he create a fable constalation Beautiful mc go When the constellations were looking at him one after another I got chills Im loving everything about this webtoon so far this

chapter said that he did too much and then he was getting a review by the dokkabea forgive my spelling or something but I still dont get it Thanks in advance That dokkaebi is a dickkk I cant wait to see what Bihyungs reaction to this move is  Wait when were there aliens WOO I had some banger music playing whilst I read this and idk why but like I havent shed tears of joy for as long as I can remember Ive never cared so much for a fictional character before especially one I thought invincible AAHH So happy to see this part  this is so good Holy crap did he just become a fable constellation Kennycarter is looking at you sponsors 5 coins al fin vi esta secuencia dibujada dios mi favorita de los inicios TT what a satisfying chapter Thank you Well THAT was epic my my my what a name what a

describe the enjoyment I have got throughout this thrilling adventure Thank you so much for creating this I will forever give you all the coins this right here ladies and gentlemen is the beginning of something great I can feel it The constellation NEPTUNES is so proud of Dokja for his wits and choosing not to stray the path of a true king Thus a new Story has begun upon us and we set sail with the 7 stars of the Big Dipper let us be worthy of their help in fending of these countless foes 5 coins for Gryffindor jkjk I mean Dokja JUST SAY KING OF A KINGLESS WORLD HOW HARD IS THAT would be nice to change to king of a kingless world it sounds way better Am I the only one who is feeling really confused by the mistranslation corrections at this point come on constellations an goat man give our guy all the rewards he deserves for being dope asf to turn down power an a kingship is a mighty sacrifice at 5he very least upgrade his skills or let him pick the constellation he wants that he mentioned long ago be his supporter Wait where is Lazy broke weeb  they didnt go too broke to read right  The constellation Foolish Husband of the Sun is hopeful this means a new constellation be born 5 coins have been sponsored Dojkawow dude A man with no constellation has gotten so much from them they dont want his story to end just yet There was some big foreshadowing in this chapter probably for things we wont see for dozens of scenarios and hundreds of chapters but Im really excited for it either way May Death do us part huiwon and sangah so hot What is YJH going to think when he awakens again Holy sht is this the beginning of a legend The constellations sharing his pain my heart  The translations are really Off in this webtoon version this webtoon seriously needs to be a movie this chapter was epic and gave me goosebumps really dislike translation of some things here ofc I appreciate the work but we have Google for a reason He said that there is no next regression for him so he would finish the story in this world so technically my theory in this is what if he just fall asleep in the train after he finished reading the story because he is too tired from work and when he finally reached the end of the story he will wake up exactly at his home destination and will continue his life because all of the happenings is just his dream God motherfucking damn our Dokja became a god damn constellation and a fabled one at that Is it just me or does this chapter feel way shorter than the others You have achieve the non existing achievement Me in my studies DamnDokja has broken every possible 4th wall and created his ownnAhh is itreally coming to an end king of the world without a throne sounds more better no when u just wanted to screenshot but u cant lmao The constellation Stormy Ram King dropped his bowl of oatmeal in shock 500 coins has been promoted That feeling when you choose not to have a supporting constellation so that you can become a constellation dokja my meowmeow my beloved Great idea Who needs a king  No king no king lalalalala Im not sorry xD bsksbskbd his ass is so lovingly rendered just like Eminem said Make me king as we move towards a new world

does the rule of plausibility MEANS Just wow thank you whoa I love this story and the art so much each episode is such a pleasant surprise This feels surprisinglyless triumphant than the story made it in my head when reading it I kinda like the mood change Your boy Dokja just hit the Ultimate Combat move So Dokja has become a Story not just the reader Glad to see him be put in the rightful place Rip king of a kingless world It was a much better name for the story compared to this I got such a big shiver from this The author and artist are working so well together Im kind of lost on what this means going forward Holy sht that was beautiful A new Fable has been created A King in a World without a King The constellations look down at Dokja with a newfound respect Hundreds of coins are being sponsored wow just wow DOKJA just spent 72000 coins just to smack the hell out of Yu I cant this guy Haha take that little girl What do you say now about Dokja not being handsome hmmm Thats what I

      "I'm happy with this twist. i'm sick of characters who try so hard to stick to the moral high ground. i‚Äôm really interested to see dokja‚Äôs developement at this point since he‚Äôs clearly not going to be a ‚Äògood‚Äô character. i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be straight up evil but i‚Äôm excited to see the extent of his neutrality at the very least. the people: ‚Äúsharing is caring!‚Äù dokja: i don‚Äôt care ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è edit: just to clarify, i don‚Äôt disagree with dokja‚Äôs decision, i just thought it was funny how people were trying to get him to maintain a high ‚Äúmoral ground‚Äù but he was just like, nah, this an apocalypse my dudesfinally, a mc that makes the most optimal choice. i've been getting bored of mc's always trying to be the hero.for real though, aside from the people dokja originally saved with the bugs, everyone is a murderer. they have a lot of audacity to be begging for their lives. i‚Äôm down with dokja‚Äôs pragmatismwait i just noticed. look at the panel when dokja cuts the guys arms, you see that he is facing away from his group. then look at the last panel, you can see that he has his back now turned to the guy whose arms he cut off and his body is facing towards his group. so that means that this man just cut the guys arms off, turned around, and then look over his shoulder to flex on all these people. xdthis really is gonna be the best webtoon on the app. and if they end up making an anime adaption you know it‚Äôll go crazyi really like the approach to an anti-hero type of character. it‚Äôs nice to see someone who is intelligent but doesn‚Äôt magically make all the right decisions, it makes him seem really human, mostly fending for himself. great work author, please keep it up. :)them: gimme coins!!!dokja: why?\n",
      "them: ugh, let‚Äôs just kill him and take the coins.\n",
      "dokja: mistake *slash*\n",
      "them: *pikachu surprised face*i guess the guy at the end there was ‚Äúdisarmed‚Äù eh ehhhhlol why didn't he just let everybody know about the 8k coins the cursed guy with the suit has?crowd: give me a refund. dokja: sorry there is a no refund policy ;)\"give us coins\" dokja: \"i missed the part where that's my problem\" this webtoon along with solo leveling is all i am looking forward to every weekcrowd: let me get that.dokja: its gone cost you an arm and leg.they had time to complete the quest but they where sitting there all that time just crying about it and now it's his fault? pathetic pretty sure sangah has ariadne as her constellation. ariadne is sometimes seen as the goddess of mazes and is credited with giving theseus a ball of string to find his way out of the minotaur's labyrinth . i mean that was so iconic from that story it just seems too coincidental. i don't know if a japanese/korean/chinese  myth involving string exists to provide an alternative. i honestly think that his decision is the \"good\"one he needs verification that anyone he gives coins to will at least be able to offer something to him in exchange. if they don't then they wouldn't be surviving very long anyways. if he helped them it would probably just make them suffer longer with no hope of actually surviving and acclimating to the new world order. i mean they couldn't muster 100 coins dokja gets that much as a gift from the constellations all the time.the first theme being original sin, would that mean the second theme is survival of the fittest? he wouldn't be doing any of them a favor by handing out coins for free, as they would be bound to the other guy. they would rather take the easy path and just kill him, when all they really need to do is offer either an item of their own, or their services in future runs. its how society is supposed to work in the grand scheme of things, where all parties work at their own pace to contribute. manager dude got 7k coins last chapter. let him save the people.m8 i think my favorite constellation is the secret plotterhe's right. he worked for his coins. even with his knowledge he still had to accomplish those things to get an award.  this webtoon touches a lot of areas in society and its great. thank you author for amazing comic [the contellations webtoon readers are happy with your performance] [you have been gifted 5 coins]i think the facts come down too no one has a moral high ground here like he said original sin they all murdered someone to be alive right now so the fact they expect some one to save them after that is ludicrous. no one is good or evil here it‚Äôs just survival for survivals sake.dokja is also not dokja, i believe he is the omniscient reader. otherwise, he would cling to humanity and sins, for example, he would had tried to save as many people as possible, but instead decided to let them choose their fates, he knows what to do and how to do it, instead of morals he thinks with the most logic. very interesting and also very hard to stay on that path. having the ability of \"the fourth wall\" also helped in move forward, resistant to fear, charm, taunts, very powerful indeedhe made a good point they all killed someone to get pass the first scenario even that little kid so if you don't take care of yourself then you don't deserve to live money grabbers jesus f*cking christ the audacity of those assholesi can't wait to see inho cheon get what's coming to him üòå gonna be even more satisfying than watching little han boy become a mother ü§∞\n",
      "edit: these aren't spoilers, this is just what i hope happens.[the constellation spiteful spender wants the next episode now]throw myeongeh under the bus! he‚Äôs got 8000 coins nowi love it when the main character doesnt stick to moral values. like they're in the apocalypse and they expect people to still follow the moral code even tho most if not all of then already killed someone  i love love love dokja‚Äôs character. i am incredibly sick of ‚Äúgood‚Äù characters that make stupid decisions because ‚Äúit‚Äôs the right thing to do‚Äù i‚Äôm fed up with the moral high ground. obviously he‚Äôs not a bad guy either, he‚Äôs just selfish and i don‚Äôt find anything wrong with placing your survival first. he is not responsible for these peoplejean henri fabre was a french naturalist in the late 1800s known for his books on the lives of insects if anyone‚Äôs curious.is it just me, or does dokja get hotter with each passing episode. i love how he looks, i love how he doesn't take bull, look at him!!! he's one of the many reasons why my standards are skyrocketinggod, i'm already so spoiled with this one episode a day lol. easily my top 3 series, can't wait for more!!!!i think the important thing here is regardless of whether or not sharing coins is the moral thing, dokja not letting himself be manipulated is better in the long run. leaving a mob under incite‚Äôs control will only hurt him in the end. not to mention, giving those coins would be like taking responsibility for those lives. it‚Äôs too much for anyone to really bare. people are saying that he wasn‚Äôt keeping a moral high ground or that the people were telling him to keep a moral high ground and he wouldn‚Äôt. but i think that he‚Äôs still got a moral high ground. these people, the moment they were manipulated or had to think things through, resorted to murder. and that‚Äôs exactly what he expected of them. so why give them coins? why trust them? i think that despite his looks saying ‚Äòneutral chaotic with evil‚Äô it‚Äôs more like ‚Äòlawful chaotic with a moral compass‚Äô.i see dokja as a survivor not good or bad just trying to live.finally this mc action makes sense in an apocalyptic world. he's not bad but smarti love how they try to attack him, he fights back, and their expression is *surprised pikachu face* i don‚Äôt seem to follow why people have been saying this makes them evil? they threw their own lives away, unable to beat their inner fear and even attempt to survive. it would be a waste to save someone like that. in fact, i‚Äôd say saving them just to force them into more suffering would be the evil choice. if they are unable to even try and survive for themselves, why not just let their suffering end? it seems cruel on the surface, but dokja's got a point in not being too generous. people who live passively and allow themselves to get manipulated by relying on charity and sponsorships won't survive if their supporters suddenly decide to leave them be. it's true in the scenario, and in this reality, toodokja is not the protagonist of twsa so he will have to take hard and clever decisions in order to survive this game till the end...and it's much more fun to see him not following the moral valueshe really does look like a villain in that lase slide, its so awesome, no wonder the constellations are interested in him.100 coins just means you‚Äôre alive one more day to beg for even more coins. it‚Äôd be a waste. hopefully dokja mentions boss man‚Äôs monies.also, i love he gave hyunsung lee a shield and lee loves him now. they‚Äôre bros. gotta max out that affinity.dokja, an actually good main character.seriously? as if he‚Äôs some high level monster that you can defeat and he‚Äôll just drop coins. why don‚Äôt they just break some pottery and pray for rupees? \"do they deserve my help.\" it's an important question. he can't be expected to shoulder the weight of all these people through the whole apocalypse. at some point they need to stand up for themselves.i love how the author sets dokja apart while inho says ‚Äúreturn the coins to the people‚Äù it sounds like he is doing it for the good of the people and dokja‚Äôs ‚Äúand if i refuse‚Äù sounds villainess but he‚Äôs the main character and it‚Äôs refreshing that he isn‚Äôt a morally bound person but at the same time hasn‚Äôt tipped too far off that has left him insane in this situation. this is absolutely one of my favorite webtoons by far and i rarely read anything other than heartwarming and romantic webtoons.first, they wanted free food. next, they were too scared to help him kill the giant rats for coins. third, when they came back, they asked for free coins, thinking that he would give. after that, they tried to kill him and expected him to be a sitting duck. finally, they have the audacity to be surprised that he sliced someone's arms off.honestly, i love dokja‚Äôs character! he‚Äôs rational and doesn‚Äôt let his emotions take the reins over his decisions. he‚Äôs the embodiment of someone going against the world‚Äôs corruption while not utilizing the common ‚Äúgood prevails‚Äù trope. i‚Äôm 100% looking forward to his journey!*hyunsung lee has started to trust you*dokja: hmmm... i can use this...i agree with dokja, there‚Äôs no reason for him to help these people, specially in the situation they‚Äôre in.the mc did the right decision because if they can survive just that one scenario how will they survive the next one those people is so pathetic the mc help them for food then they will blamed him for losing of coinsüòëi don‚Äôt need sleep, i need the next episode!yay! a gray area character!!people who rely on others too much usually drag down the whole group because they always expect you to save them and feed of the kindness of others. in a survival situation you have to either drag them with you and risk getting the whole squad killed or you have to leave them behind to save those who are able to stand alone. i think dokja made the right decision because it would mean he'd have to take care of a bunch of people even in the future. that is not a longterm solution.i feel like dokja is more rational than evil as people are saying. he makes smart decisions and calls based on logic. everybody is talking about the moral high ground and how hes evil when mans is making rational decisions and being smart. hes neither good nor evil hes j a guy with a rational mindthis comics unreleased episodes are starting to make me agree with \"coins are power\"...i love dokja‚Äôs personality. in my opinion, he is correct. this is the apocalypse, and he isn‚Äôt obliged to help everyone. everyone brought food because they were hungry. it‚Äôs their own decision! what does dokja have to do with it? if they wanted coins, earn it themselves. it‚Äôs every man for themselves[constellation of anticipation has fast passed all episodes and is now anxiously awaiting the future.] i love this author already. they're the first to actually show you when the veil of civilization is torn apart by apocalypse. even after murdering another person to survive, these people are acting dependant on others. if they don't fend for themselves, no one will fight for them anymore. beautiful storytelling.that's one the the reasons i really like this story, the mc is quite different from the standar hero üôà i'll support him as far as he don't betray his team üòåüëådam i caught up to quickly again i‚Äôm so happy that‚Äôs he‚Äôs releasing quickly and with great quality i‚Äôll keep spending coins as long as they keep coming people i know that there are some people who came here from the webnovel but for those of us who are reading it for thw first time on webtoon dont google anything about omnimicent reader because it will just most likely spoil the manwha for you like it did for me\n",
      "edit: did anyone else love hyeonseongs face when he was holding the shieldthis is absolutely perfect, dokja maintains logical thinking in a time where it would be necissary to do so, so it actually makes sense, he isnt a hero, just a guy, a lucky guy but a guy nonetheless.none of you can say that dokja isn't good. he doesn't do bad things, he just does what is needed to survive. moral ground won't work in \"apocalyptic world\". he didn't use them, he just simply did what was best for him so i really like his decisiondokja= badassdokja in the end of the story= fucking badassü•¥well this is real interesting dokja is a unique protagonist and i absolutely love it[the constellation ‚Äúlazy procrastinator‚Äù is excited for the next chapter]although, those background characters are hella annoying for being hypocrites, their reactions and actions are all natural. i mean, who did expect this to happen? not even dokja. dokja is lucky enough to have knowledge about the overall situation.  also, it's understandable as to why they're afraid to go out for the quest. i mean, their families and friends didn't come back after they joined something like that. true neutral character coming through.as a mother i say kill the greedy bastards and save the children, but as a lover of apocalypse stories, the kids would get him killed.i am now a simp for dokja ü§öthey only show interest in dokja when they need something from him. why should he share his coins with them? he made the right call üò§you have me hooked! dokja‚Äôs decision really gave a sense of reality to the comic. most would make their characters be the ‚Äògood‚Äô guy, stick to morals and would give themselves to save others. dokja is a very  rational character and i am excited to see where his story leads him. y did i have the biggest smile on my face when he said \"y should i give u any\".... am i psychodokja really takes no ones shit and i think that‚Äôs what makes him such an awesome protagonist. like yeah it‚Äôs cruel but considering the circumstances, he‚Äôs got every right to refuse. no one else has done anything that deserves his help. it‚Äôs survival of the fittest, people are bound to show their ugly sides no matter whatif i was one of the people there, i would be desperate and honestly feel some resentment towards dokja, but i'd also understand that he very much risked his life to get the food and coins he has and i don't have the right to demand him to give me some, especially if i haven't even tried to risk my life to get them myself. so i understand if they feel frustrated, but it should be more with themselves and the situation. what dokja's doing is perfectly fine and realistic.absolutely love this anti-hero, what a fresh twist. looking forward to the lack of romance and high action packed chapter to followi love him, he's not evil just logical and fairthey're all using scrap metal, bats, tools, and pipes as weapons with some waving bone weapons as the highest thing there, and this mf pulls out a swordhe risked his own life to get the food. of course he is not going to give it all out for free.i like a lot dokja just because he's not pretend  to be like the hero or something like that he's just acting like the situation are and the instinct of survive. the woman‚Äôs constellation has to be ariadne right? like with the whole thread to get out of the dungeon thing is kinda like her and the labyrinth i mean why should he give them coins when they are threatening him? i was wondering how they were going to portray the dokkaebi chat! i must say i am thoroughly pleased. i love the emoticons. üòÇüíúthis webtoon is so amazing!!! the art is some of the best i've ever seen, it is so well done, i love it! the plot is awesome! i normally don't like apocalypse-themed stories, but this is amazing!!! the characters are fantastic, too (especially dokja) i love how realistic they all are. i can tell how hard the author(s) worked on this, and they did truly some of the best work i've ever seen. \n",
      "well done!dokja!!! me too give me just 5 coins to know what happens next in the story!!!! and then give me 5 more!!!! and then 5 more!!! and then 5 more!!!....... then i will pay you back please!!!! i just want to see more of your surprising and amazing intellegence and decisions!!!!-   *1 second later*  *rip my arms ;;;;*god i wanna read more, why cant this series just be over so i can binge it i love that he's not a hero. i get tired of all the high morals and instead he's a survivor. this comic is amazing what‚Äôs the old saying about jesus, ‚Äúgive a man a fish he will that day, teach a man how to fish he will eat every day.‚Äù  giving them coins doesn‚Äôt solve the issue because what about the next day and day after that they‚Äôll need someone to help them rather help themselves. these people complain about morality but don't hesitate to kill people for coins. at leat dokja's transparent. they all knew about the survival fee, yet they still bought so much food that they didn‚Äôt have any left for the fee. now correct me if i‚Äôm wrong, but didn‚Äôt you get 200 coins for clearing the first situation? they had enough coins there alone to survive two days. but they bought large quantities of food in order to have it. now doesn‚Äôt that sound like the sloth and fox sin? gluttony and greed? screw them dokja is definitely doing the right thing. it's funny how those people went from pleading for dokja's help to being completely hostile towards him. talk about true colors huh.unrelated, but i swear to god i am screaming about this little boy. gilyeong i love you so damn much. i don't know what it is but something about him has just stuck in my heart since the beginning. and every reaction with dokja just makes my head spin. the 'big brother' vibes are killing me!honestly it‚Äôs messed up that they‚Äôre all so dependent of dokja since he has the food and the coins. like damn if yall want some then stop sitting around and get some yourself. survival of the fittest and wisest am i right? if your kid doesn‚Äôt have enough coins or food, stop babying him/her and teach them to survive not to depend on othersdude is a true capitalistdokja is such a badassin an apocalypse there could have been no better choice.leshgooooo i'm so glad he's not your typical hero he has his own sense of neutrality nd i love that damn it why is he so hotpeople can hate dokja all they wanti still think he's bae üò©‚ù§Ô∏è‚úãüèΩdamn...dokja is ‚ú®ÔΩÜÔΩâÔΩéÔΩÖ ‚ú®ah, yes. this is the type of mc i like. üòåy didn‚Äôt he say that guy with the glasses have 7,000 coin just ask himüòÇhe's using like a mythical max level weapon on level 1 villagers i love how people were trying to guilt him using morals and then literally two seconds later tried to kill himomniscient reader is the best thing on this universe i completely understand why he chose to do that if he wouldve chosen to give his coins out most of the people would die anyway and he would‚Äôve wasted 2000 coins for no reason leaving him with way less coinsits funny how the same people willing to kill to survive are the same ones that ask for coins to survive like get your crazy ideas that world revolves around you under control. dokja aint at fault for the fact u domt have survival fee after all u did was sit on your asses and wait for someone else to take care of youi really like where this is headed. so many stories have the main character stick to the typical hero plot, which there‚Äôs nothing wrong with because it always makes a good story. but i really like how different this is. it‚Äôs a way more accurate portrayal of the chaos and the human desire to survive. people really wouldn‚Äôt be generous in this scenario. it really is a fantastic depiction of survival of the fittest.the reason wednesdays exist. omniscient readerdokja just became one of my 3 favourite mcs.i like this so much. i didn‚Äôt think he was going to kill someone but you got to do what you gotta do. and it‚Äôs not some game, this is actual survival. you already payed for the food so no refunds. this is a game of survival and you must think wisely i think everyone can agree it‚Äôs so refreshing to have a character who cares about others but also knows to look after themself first. can‚Äôt wait to see how it develops further thank you author keep up the great work!dokja‚Äôs character is what‚Äôs lacking in solo leveling. limits. i rly, rly like dokjams character, the whole series i believe is a gem that needs to be caressed slowly. great job author. hope it continues to prosper i'm a caring person but i'm siding with dokja. they don't see that they allowed this situation and are still being manipulated.why do i feel like dojka is going to turn into a nuetural good character?can i just say that sword is real nice1. dokja sold food for $10 while inho sold his food for more.2. why should dokja be responsible for all these people life's if he isn't even part of the group. if inho the leader shouldn't he be responsible for everyone.\n",

i feel like most mains are usually true good or true evil, but so far i'd say he's pretty neutral. he's so interesting and unpredictable.dick leader: hey bro don't you have the most coins? everyone: *communism intensifies*honestly i‚Äôm happy. protagonists should focus on their own survival. it‚Äôs not realistic to expect someone to sacrifice themselves for a bunch of strangers, not to mention ones who have killed innocents to survive forget morality... this is spartathanks author, how is this comic not popular? you need to be appreciated author nice decision, he worked hard for those coins. those people should‚Äôve worked for coins when they clearly had the chance, not leeching of someone else‚Äôs coins. it is also not even his fault that they don‚Äôt have coins from not using it wisely. so honestly, don‚Äôt give me that shit! üò§[the constellation \"of random things\" happily greets dokkaebi bihyung.] [the constellation \"of random things\" expresses excitement for the upcoming events.] [200 coins sponsored.]fuck, i love dokja sm i think dokja is doing the right thing even if the other people think he is being selfish.  in a survival scenario, you can't depend on others to save you. the incite guy is banking on dokja's morality forcing him to play nice, but survival is the goal, not being liked.ariadne was a princess who gave someone (theseus or daedalus i think?) her magical thread for them to escape a labyrinth. im a super greek mythology geek so my theory is sangah's constellation might be ariadne or something?? its funny how they blame dokja for everything, like did he forces you to buy the food or what? dokja: i‚Äôll give you the coins back if you can undigest all that food you bought from mehe handled that nicelyit's funny how similar this is to real capitalism. people always seem to demonize people with money because there  are \"needy\" out there and thus try to take their money through various means. just a connection my brain made.oh shi- turned him into overhaul ü§£ü§£pacifism is a point of weakness in a world where everyone has already killed.i've never bought any coins or tried to on this app but this story not only made to buy and look for coins but also the only one for which i use all those coins and that's saying something no sorry a lottt.btw i just love dokja's character the right balance of good and evil he knows when to be good and when not to be he doesn't follow common guide lines or general society morals which are dubious at times like these.i read it in the novel but i still get irritated and upset with this scene!!! kim dokja may sound selfish but everyone else needs to be responsible for their own lives. giving them fish for today wont help them tomorrow. ironically i have ran out of coins so now i have to wait..the constellation, the reader of a thousand webtoons, gives dokja a bro fist of approval!\"are you jean-henri fabre or something?\" bahahahahahaha amazing üòÇaslal is really interested in every decision dokja make she has become a fan of yours here‚Äôs your five coin bro we all just people spending money to read will we all heard this qoute \"if you make this a game, i'll show you how it's played\".  that's how exactly how he manage to not keep going to his game (plan). i love it and i'm still willing to waste more coins.strong escanor vibes^¬∞^well at least this webtoon is  close to reality in terms of attitudei'm done with hypocrite characters so always have those high values that sometimes it doesn't feel real at all. i cannot express how much i love protagonists like dojka- a person‚Äôs bound to get tired of mary sues at some point üòîi love moral grey points in post apocalypse i hate seeing the goody twoshoes in these situations, its literally kill or be killed everyone there has taken a life so they dont deserve true sympathyall y'all getting heated in the comments coz dokja ain't fit your standards of \"high morality\" theyre all murderes lmao dokja raised a very good point on ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt even take responsibility for their own lives.‚Äù so why would dokja be responsible for their lives‚Ä¶ yes, it would be kind and generous of dokja if he‚Äôs willing to give it to them for free. but for him this is survival of the fittest and he earned those big money because of his smart thinking/strategy. he has the right to refuse as selfish and cruel as it sounds. them trying to leech on him forcibly and badmouthing him when they aren‚Äôt even‚Äî‚Äî\"be nice and give these murderers you don't even know some of your life line and risk you and your own group's safety and survival to make these people who just sit in a corner till someone comes whom they can leech off on survive 24 hours then leech off on you again next time cuz you're nice\" yeah sure no shtpff to be completely honest i would've been worse in dokja's situation like i don't know why i should save them. i don't mind being called the 'villain'.. i just protect those people i value and i'm not about to risk nor sacrifice the chances of 'our survival' to murderers i barely knowi love it when the mc is neither a hero or a villainbro wjy is he so hoti'm beginning to like this man. i think i‚Äôm in love right now i would just mention that this fella right here killed a demon and got 7000 coins as reward, so one of your men now has enough coins to save everyone. sheesshhh mah guy turn to erenok but bihyeong was so cute in that one panel xddhe watched his own hands wave him goodbye üëãüèª üòÇüòÇü§£üòÇi might sound wicked but i really liked how he reacted üòàim still not done reading the novel but dang i love dokja's character so much! but once again, none of these people tried to hunt monsters and complete the task. like, bruh. they're just a bunch of leeches! and, the spirit said that 100 coins will be drawn daily. even if they had it for the night, they wouldn't have any for the next night. and they still wouldn't try to go kill monsters.rn my favorite constellation is prisoner of the golden headbandthat moment when u are done playing the good guy route...this is definitely an interesting scenario; nice to see bihyeong again, toochaotic neutral lol well he's not evil bc all of these people are murderers too lol. even worse they're entitled ones who did it w/o thinking (in the first task)üò¨dokja is really right i mean they taken someone else's life for their survival and now they aren't ready with their life to be taken that's so ridiculous lol dokja's a chaotic neutral typehe is being realistic tho. im sick of mc who is always trying to be goody two shoes. its an apocalypse, who tf in their right mind would want to help others? lets be real.i think dokja is a complex, morally grey character. i like those types.am i the only one having a deja vu of kirito from sao?it's their fault that they don't have coins. leeching off of other people and then blaming a guy who worked hard for his coins? no thanks üôÑü§öüèºthey're just pretending to have a high morality. high morality yet illogical. üôÑ buzzing excuses without even thinking. justice should be served!

that's literally impossible!! it's an upswing too!!!hyeongsong lee is so üòçüòçüòçdamnnn dokja is seeming to be more malevolent now, even the art is making him look evil. wonder if his allies will keep supporting him, though they didn't seem like they'd want to share their coins either. sangah seems reminiscent of ariadne from the greek myths, so i'm wondering where she'll stand too.even the constellations were speechless üò≥holy shit this is so refreshingdokja's principles üò≤üò≤üò≤‚óã-‚óã that was hotwow i think he's going to be an anti hero i love how he cut off that guys arms with 0 hesitation these people's hypocrisy is just so real to me if ever this apocalypse happens. the audacity to be guilt tripping someone to greed over their lives when that person's already trying to survive himself too.

he just went and got food like any of them could've.the constellation, webtoon fangirl, is very intrigued. i‚Äôm curious to see how dokja‚Äôs party thinks of this. them ppl thought dokja was pussy üòÇüòÇüòÇ. the entitlement of all of them as if he had to help them because why? to be a good person? please. they all sat around on their asses instead of trying to fend for themselves and expect him to give out his resources he earned for free. byeee ain't his fault since he didn't force you guys to buy the foodshit i love this webtoon! i think i'm addicted to iti like dokja's thinking. all those people literally killed other people to make it this far but now act like their the victims at the hands of his mercy. if they were ready to kill other people for survival they are responsible for their own survival as well. it's also unlikely for them to survive anyway if they don't stop to rely on other people. and they literally had the choice to either try finishing the scenario or die because of lack of coins. the first might have even provided some coins.honestly, what are they gonna do to him if he doesn't share? in a matter of minutes they'll all be dead anyways so...i love his character....  it's real....  who would want to share his live freely with someone he didn't know survival of the fittest bitch... you adapt or you die... üò±üò±üò± (me likey üòè) and thats how this became my favorite webtooni love that \"do you have a death wish or something\" look at the end üëådokja doesn't have time for your bs dude... here i am the person who read the novel patiently waiting to see kyrgioschaotic neutral?wait until you see what he become in the futurewhat i find interesting is that these people who are themselves killers trying to hold dokja to a moral high ground. like bish??yup. inho needs to see he ain‚Äôt the boss. and the people need to see that inho has been mooching off of them. parents with little kids, children, women have it rough in scenarios like these :/ but even dokja knows that he needs to cull thieving menaces to be of real help. and that dude that got violated by a demon seems to not have learned his lesson either :/the point is, that all the people in this scenario are murders. they have killed someone to be in this scenario. for them to be asking for coins as if it is the moral thing to do is ridiculous. it depends on who actually deserves to be helped. sangah's ability reminds me of the legend of theseus and the minotaur.i'm glad the main character is basically saying, \"f*ck you. i'm tryna survive too\" ain't no charity in these streets! this is just life, the rich people don't hand out money, we work for our coins.i think his point is justifiable. he straight up asked why do you deserve his coins. prove it, get them. this is the apocalypse, being friends wouldn't help you survive for long. üòåto be honest, dokja is the type of person who is alone, but when it comes to life-threatening situations he would do anything and help anyone if it benefits him as well. the type of people dokja is helping are the type to 'give-and-take'. they are all compatible in there small 'group' that dokja made. they help each other out. on the other hand inho cheon who don't give any f***s and use other people. (i would also like to see inho cheon face when that man hands got cut of by dokja!)also dokja legit is getting food and this is what they do ;---; the respect !he might point out that the got who killed the monster has 8,000 coins and that the guy leading them didn't seem worried so he must have plenty of coins to sparedear santa, please give me coins so i can read the next chapter. i promise i'll be good. remember people to heart this chapter, let's appreciate the character's uniqueness ‚ù§Ô∏èkillin old ladies one moment and begging for mercy the next? naaaawwwww bruhs. i'm good. ah chaotic good i am familiar them: give us our coins back!!  dokja: ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø survival of the fittest ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ødokja is looking out for his newly formed family. notice how he was telling his new kid brother not to use his ability until he tells him to? or how he lets the girl know not to tell anybody about her contract? or how he got a shield for his buddy? it seems to me he's looking out not just for himself but his friends. oh and love the back and forth with the dokabilmao, i just realized something. coins are the most powerful thing in that world and this is the same for us. people who have enough coins can fastpass while us peasants are left to die in boredom and impatience lewlthe moral high ground has no meaning when the first thing you had to do to survive was take another lifehe just had enough of your shitthank you for the realism when your life‚Äôs at stake there‚Äôs no time for a moral high ground....‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èhelp me, i have a serious thing for dokjai feel like you could never stick to a moral high ground in an apocalyptic universe. people are gonna die and you want to survive, what you have to do to survive may not he the most morally good thing to do. but that's life.i like dokja‚Äôs way of thinking it‚Äôs not the typical ‚Äúhero‚Äù personality that he‚Äôs got but at least he thinks rationally depending on the situation they are in stan dokja üõêdid they think they'd survive if it weren't for dokja giving them the food? what do they think is dokja to them?? their nanny? ofc he's gonna ask you to pay for shit. nothing is free in this world. nothing. i really do love dokja's character to death, he's not the usual annoyingly good guy mc and even the protagonist of the story isn't nice. they're human and it shows, i love how much this webtoon shows the flaws of us living beings. i also would do the same thing, he's smart, cunning and selfish plus he tells it how it is, like why should i give up my coins for y'all when that has nothing to do with me? he reminds me of myself and i love iti think dokja is a good person. he does help people when he can, like heewon. but theres a line between nice and stupidty. he cant just sacrifice himself for everyone else. in such an insane world, it really forces your true self out of you. i like how this mc isnt just gonna blindly follow \"we must help others!! sharing is caring!~\" like many other mcs do. another example of an mc i think is similar to dokja in the above stated manner, is medea from your throne. dokja sure is one hell of an interesting character huhi love how realistic (kind of) dokja is, i mean his personalitydokja had to risk his life in many situations in order to earn that many coins, it‚Äôs his right to keep those coins to himself instead of giving it to people that sat around in a safe zone waiting for coins and food while others went out and risked their lives for coins and food. ü§∑okay but seriously. how many of them killed to survive the first round? only thise who didnt deserve it. and honestly, survival of the fittest (and his friends). he and his crew went out and earned those coins. they didnt kill a single person eitheridk why people think the protag is evil, in the first game he saved the child when he had no reason to, and he also saved the woman from the poison when yet again he had no reason to. it just so happens that they were useful the child was not in the webtoon that he was reading and the woman was but he had no idea who she wasi'm just waiting for the constellation secretive plotter to reveal that he/she is the author of twsano shits were given.bro what abt the suit guy he has like 7000 coinsthe ad i got at the end of this episode just so happened to be a snickers ad.self defence. moral high ground: they took lives, why should he save theirs? i dunno, still pretty high morals and he attacked only when his life was in danger ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it‚Äôs not all so black and whitedealing with people is exhausting irl and even in apocalypse.are we just gonna ignore hyeongseong lee being adorable after polishing his shield??right, if you need coins get them for yourself. dokja literally fights everytime while the others just wait for food and coins. it's an apocalypse. i dont like it morally but i do agree with him since he did earn the coins and this is life or death he cant rlly be charitable in this kind of situation yep, i'm addicted :ddokja was like: nah this an apocalypse not a charity :)üò®üò®üò® dokja sometimes is really scary !!'i want a refund' huh lol ok karen \"i want a refund!\" when you ask for a refund you gotta bring back what you bought, no? then give the food back- oh you can't? not his problemdude there's literally a survival fee for everyday... say dojka gave away all these coins for the people ok and then what. he cant do this everyday so they're going to die anyway. like bruh he's not even being \"evil\" i played way too much etrian odyssey to not recognize an ariadne thread when i see one üòÇooh what a powerful boy we got therei love grey charactersthat army guy is so cute when he wipe that shield üòÜüòÜüòÜskfjfjsjfjj why am i so into the whole morally grey mc trope üò© especially when they got that 2000 iq üëåü§å like medea muah chefs kissthings have gotten so interesting :)i misread \"have you all been well\" and saw it \"have you all been in hell\"luke skywalker would be proud i love me some psychological warfarethis is survival, anything goes. if only you hadn't bought excessively then none of this would've happened. he may look like he's making heartless decisions but it's simply survival.lol our favorite doakabi is backi mean even if he went full on humanitarian and gave away every single scrap he still couldn‚Äôt save everyone. in rescue training they teach you never to put yourself in a position of unnecessary risk bc you‚Äôll just increase the number of people needing rescued...same idea here. some degree of selfishness required. i'm satisfied with dokja's decision!morally grey characters are my weaknesswhy isn't anyone talking about bihyeong? he was hilarious (and adorable)! that wink! and that \"totally innocent\" whistling!so... chaotic neutral character niceother readers: \"i love this dood's attitude\"............ me: \"yay bihyeong's back!\"a character with common sense and isn't an asshole, i'm hooked now. dokja is so badass im here for itbruh the kid in the back is lookin just as evil as dokja. he like \"mfer deserved it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èi'm kind of happy.  a little sad that some kids will die but, these people can't seem to understand that this world now revolves in a different way.  and dokja will ride the waves.im glad that dokja didn't give infck that dumb face inho i wannaüòíüëä himi love how this dude really keeps targeting dokja,he doesn't even help them out himself just using their misfortune to manipulate them :/no more kind dokjai like how dokja has gone from ‚Äúi am a normal person‚Äù to ‚Äúi am a super genius‚Äù to ‚Äúwhy should i give a shit if you live or die‚Äù over the course of ~20 chaptersin a situation where you dont need morals to survive... i like that attitude...heh..he's so hot god i need a minutethe look in his eye is crazy... and i love itcheckmate, communists yes!yes!yes !yes!!!!!!!! kill them alli love it when the mc turns evilooo goddamn dokja is becoming a morally grey character (someone who isn‚Äôt good but not bad)dokja is my new religion üßé‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èhonestly i get it; why sacrifice for people who leech off of you and kill you the first chance they get. the best thing to do, while they still had plenty time, would've been to try to fulfil the scenario with the strongest leading the charge or with inho inspiring the others but unfortunately those in charge are selfish cowards i'm glad he chooses to be selfish cause for what reason he wanna give them the coins? in this time you should save yourself first before save other people. yay the little crazy creature is bk and l love dokia face is like a crazy person laughing to himselfthis webtoon is awesome,  the main character is very progressive and hyper aware of the situation i love it. hey uh dokja got cake all these people survived by murdering someone if anything they shouldn‚Äôt even talk about sharing and having morals. i think dokja‚Äôs decisions are right. i think morally he is doing the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing to survive. what about what‚Äôs his face that received 7000 coins for finishing off the demon? couldn‚Äôt he sharei love how dokja thinks, fck morals, be smart this is why i love anti-hero main characters am i the only one who laughed when the guy looked back at his falling arms?üëÄ it was funny to me i'm not sadistic tho lolif this was real life than i'd probably have to think about my personal morals and the situation a bit before siding with dokja, but since this is fiction i'm satisfied as hell with what's happening right now. go dokja :dugh man i read it to fast. now i have to waitüòÖüò¢ooooooh yes i love dokja. he's one of the best characters i've seen in webtoon so far.everyones gonna forget that 8,000 coins that evil rich dude got for slaying the monsterwould have been funny if he said that the annoying ex workmate had just won 8000 coins. just wondering what would have happened then :p holy fudge!!! this is the mc that i've been looking for!!!this has nothing to do with the webtoon but, long live the demon kinghe‚Äôs not rude.. he‚Äôs just being smart. all these ppl would never give him if they had..period. they would never and we all know that.. so ya, why would he? dokja is the one character who's neither too kind and good to be true neither evil and ruthless he's smart and wise it's so refreshing to see such a character and well ofc he's climbing up the 2d best list too quicklyomg make this an anime!!!awooooga bark bark grrrrryesss love a good chaotic neutral character. i wonder what the backstory of that kid did since the first scenario is to kill an organism. i wonder if he killed a person or something else. \n",
      "the kid as in one of the woman‚Äôs kid.\n",
      "i love it when my main characters go chaotic neutral.did anyone notice huwons traits is about to blossom hope she doesn‚Äôt become a mass murder like dokja said she mightplease make this an anime!!!i like how the authors made clear dokja its not a piece of cake by making him cut both arms of the thug at once... no joking around...i love this. i can't even writehe went from zero to badass in 2 secondsi'll call it as a realistic, smart and pratical good character. dokja is the epitome of true neutral i'm really curious to see how his friends are going to react for him doing that. in a survival speaking it was a really good choice, if your point in that time is to survive, then morals and feelings are useless. however, in a \"human\" way of seeing this situation, no matter what you tell yourself, there is this feeling of morality that tells you \"what he did was wrong to those persons who are just trying to live and you shouldn't be with him\" so it becomes a huge psychological conflict.dokja's perfect retaliation.... this is why it's one of the top webtoonsthey all asked so nicely for the coins and food before but when he's finally being a little selfish because there his coins they all just try to kill him like dude he gave away all of his food and risked his life to find more and this is what they resort to loloriginal sin? i think it refers to the 7 deadly sin. pride - inho the b@st@rd lust - the guys that tryna rape girls by luring them back in the early ep. greed - them hovering over dokja's food and money sloth - them be just sittin there waiting for food wrath - inho and the people attacking dokja envy - cursed dude envying dokja for its achievements gluttony - idk?yeah this decision seems logical to me ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏ènew world , new rules , even on normal world there is no good people and evil people . there is survival your mind, own sense od justicethis webtoon is a war between my ‚Äúwork together to survive‚Äù mentality vs my ‚Äúgive no shits cause they don‚Äôt deserve it‚Äù mentality it‚Äôs getting so fucking goodour coins what i find funny is how they all say they want a refund, but they already ate all the food-dokja really said f in the chat to the people who can't pay for it. üëÅüëÑüëÅi want dojak to turn the tables \"besides. none of this fee stuff would have happened if greedie boy over there didn't stockpile foodlove when main characters go semi dark in these situations.i really shouldn‚Äôt be laughing this hard üòÇ dokja really is the definition of true neutraldojka in the last panel left me with shivers down my spine...i would have turned it around. i would have said \"okay, but only if you and your group redistribute your own coins first. let's see your status screen and the other search party members and have you pay off as much as possible, then i can pay the remainder. that should be fair since i haven't officially joined this group yet and have been attacked twice already. don't  delay too long of you want everyone to survive.\"i'm eagerly waiting for the next episode. dokja is not a hero known for his heart of gold and his bravery. he's just another player with a distinct advantage. he has intricate knowledge of the game world and he has to use that knowledge wisely. i'm sure he doesn't want people to die, but there's no point in killing himself for them, so early in the game. he might give them a chance if he deems them worthy of joining his party, but that's about it. dokja is so freaking cool because he is not one of those goody-goody \"always do whats right and angelic and kind at your own expense!\" kind of character, but he is not just a straight up \"kill everyone and make explosions for no reason but to cause suffering!\" kind of character either. it is so amazing and i love it.it was the people decision to buy the food in the first place, then they crazy cause they don‚Äôt have the coins to survive anymore. tough luck man ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èi think dokja is chaotic neutralhe did the right decision. i would of done the same or just not returnyou see those mental gymnastics right there. first they blame dokja for all their problems then they expect him to fix their problems and then expect him to just sit their and let them jump him. hilarious hahaha the fine line between morality vs justice. it may not be morally right to not help those people but they put themselves in that position, so it would be unjust to dokja if he were to selflessly sacrifice what he had earned himself. it‚Äôs all oh so sweet!!! gotta love dokja my man üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºit isn't morality, it's justice. what have they done to deserve the coins, it's just stupid. the next time they need to pay the fee, they won't have any coins, because there aren' t helping nor going out for supplies. btw, black shorted hair girl is waifu uwui was getting tired of him playing along, for the love of god, it's the f*cking apocalypse!!!i really like this character development. unlike other main characters, this make apocalypses more realistic i hope dokja knock some sense into those people against inho or even themselves. they let themselves get into a position where inho's group has power over them. it may not be the best decision for dokja, but it may have been a wise one.yes finally an mc in dealing with these kind of scenarios the way i want them too!!!! no more playing the hero and saving people who don't need to be saved or will just flip on you at the drop of a dime. my god.... the adrenaline kick from this episode. love it  anyway i really hope this gang stays as allies üòåüòåhm so dokja is a gray characteri üëèüèΩ don't üëèüèΩhave üëèüèΩmoney üëèüèΩ so üëèüèΩ i'll üëèüèΩ wait üëèüèΩ lmao üò≠ this webtoon is a dopethose people...are so stupid, really he worked hard for it, and it's not his fault that they didn't get to eat bc it got confiscated and also they didn't hunt..they can't just stick or think someone will do things for them to survive..then they have the audacity to ask for coins when all they do is complain best. mc. ever.of course those people deserve coins but if they‚Äôre all clamoring and running up towards him violently he can‚Äôt give them to anyone since he doesn‚Äôt even have enough coins. in addition they are only thinking of themselves when doing this- trying to attack him, saying that he *needs* to give them coins, because they need them more than him, because it‚Äôs evil to do otherwise. they act out of selfishness, so why can‚Äôt dokja act out of selfishness too? this is the apocalypse i badly want an animation of this webtoon. i know it will and i cant for itü§ßü§ßdokja is right all of these people killed someone else to clear the first scenario. now why they are asking him for help? that's not how you survive fellas. you go dokja. as long as he is not betraying anyone he is finebihyeong in the background, looking adorable and secretly chatting with dokja is precious. best thing ever. bihyeong is my fave. even though he's a cosmic being that basically runs a torture channel ruining lives, and he's not actually, like, a good guy i guess. but whatevs he fictional and sometimes lovelyi think he just wants to see who attacks him and help out the restthe satisfaction when undeserving people don't get what they want. üò≥personal attribute of a badassit's nice to have a main character who thinks rationally and makes the right decision. i love reading his thoughts because they analyze the situations clearly. if they can't take care of their own lives, what right did they have to take others? anyways even if he gave them coins today they will ask for more tomorrowthis is basically equity vs equality. should we all receive the same? or should we all achieve the same level?yes! that's exactly what i wanted to see! this webtoon just climbed up the ranks of my top 10 with a gigantic leap.everyone who is saying dokja is gonna be a bad character kind of person, i will say these are his survival tactics if he just agrees to everything other people say then whats the profit in reading twsa. he needs to be one of the protagonist that i feelit feels to me like dokja is going to walk a weird sort of moral grey area and apply pressure on both sides to survive. i like this...ok but suit man has like 8k coins, someone let them knowwhy does he let blond main group leader live?.. he kills for lessthis is totally interesting survival story where moral ground is in conflict with survival of the charactersfinally. tbh i would of been done killed someone bro. like fr. idc let me be the villain that is full and is rich off coins. i earned my fair share. should of read the book. sucks to suck. tell on the so called \"leader\" that bastard.it would have been seriously idiotic if dokja had chosen otherwise. usually all the protagonists try to be heroic and hold on to their morals and stuff with the stupid self sacrificing personality. but dokja is straightforward legendary!!! and his face in that panel \"why should i give you any?\" was so badass!!!!! it‚Äôs nice to have heroes that act selfish once in a while. it‚Äôs quite refreshing to see the people‚Äôs faces like ‚Äúwhat?!? but we wasted our money on your food!!! refund!!!‚Äù i‚Äôm like ‚Äúbruh, if you can‚Äôt return the food in one edible piece, why should he give back the coins?‚Äùyou don't care about him, so, why would he care about you? üòíohohohohohoit's not censoreddokja keeps showing traits of maybe why his destiny chose him to hold more power in the times of apocalypse. people deserve love, mercy and sharing to prosper together but dokja also knows how to find the true deserving one's. ...when you go to attack someone, you should expect them to fight back. he has more coins than all of you for a reason.now this is what a protagonist should bewell frick. why does dokja have to be so hot and cool. help me pls. somebody.you don‚Äôt need to set yourself on fire, to keep other people warm. greedy people just take and take, there‚Äôs no end to it. one day it‚Äôs this, another it‚Äôs that. i‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs not giving in. it‚Äôs rare to see a main character not maintain morals. this series is so original and well written, and honestly i hope it gets its own anime.me who needs 5 coins to feed the next episodewhen u try to roleplay a true neutral pc on dungeons and dragonsfinally a main character who isn‚Äôt always niceoh i like him more and more why should dokja share his coins if they didn't even earn them. everyone literally wants everything for free and it's pathetic.yess a protagonist makes a practical decision he looks dead on the inside.he literally disarmed that guythis was a rather....disarming episodethread and labyrinth huh? i think her sponsor is a greek mythdokja yesss you will not be fooled by that evil manokay but why is the dokkaebi so cute?this webtoon is so amazing i do not regret fast passing [the constellation reading this during online classes has gifted 5 coins]lee hyeonseong. lee hyunsung. whatever spelling your name is lmao. you precious bean. i wanna protect you with my life. i wanna wrap you in a blanket and sing you lullabies ;-;this webtoon always makes me coins spendin and im not regretting it. aaaaahhh. this nigga rawdokja gives a lesson, stand up for urself, u always gonna be kind to everyone then u gonna get urself killed... limit ur kindness ^_^the fact that i have to wait is killing me but this is now my new favorite series fast pass isn't fast enough if you reached the last available episode... üòêi like how dokja is a true neutral character, not a protagonist but also not a villain. he doesn‚Äôt hurt or help anybody he doesn‚Äôt have to (with exceptions lol)  and i am excited to see where his character development goes from here :3finally. i feel bad for the guy who got his arm cut off. but damn that is one effective way to settle a crowd and get them to listen real quick... even if only for a minute, it could make all the difference is this man just going to straight up murder the leader? damn i hope so.vote dokja for most savage man of 2020not even 100, someone just spare me 5 more coins. i promise i'll pay you back. just 5 more to make it to the next scenario!welp now i‚Äôm officially going bankrupt... thank you webtoonssharin ain‚Äôt carin in 2020 üò∑excited to see a well written anti hero! these are so hard to cone by these daysi see dokja being a grey area character. not necessarily evil but not good either hes just true neutral .people: kill the man who survived the subway dokja: *deletes a mans arms* please do continue to try if you want to diethat‚Äôs insane. he‚Äôs giving out coins in trade for hands.i love dokja.this is not a handy situation. its all out of hand and in the palm of chaos. but this story is finger licking good.came to comment on how much i like having a neutral main character, but so did everyone else üòÇoh boy, he‚Äôs not playing around anymorewhy cant they release two chapters a day?! they got me f*cked up having to wait! üëÄüò°üò° also i love homegirl that asked for the sword lol  bish has no chill and i love it,  she is def gun be a bad ass character ‚úäüèΩüëäüèΩüí¢that'll be me when i stop acting nice to everyone and smiling.dokja is right. why would he give his coins for them? if he gave his coins, they will just be thankful at first, but the system will collect coins and the cycle will repeat again. it's 100% waste, he don't even know or owe them. they're parasites, and you wouldn't want parasites stick on you and extract all you have until you have none.i‚Äôm not gonna put dokja on a pedestal for cutting the guy‚Äôs forearms off, but i will say, this is getting pretty interesting. slayyy dokja as you shouldhe always think logically i love his characteri'm so addicted to this webtoonwhat high morality and shit?? dokja collected all those coins himself, he risked his life to get the foods too. if anything it's those \"leeches\".,,,that went from.. \"please give us some of your coins~\" to \"kill him and get his coins from him\" real quickdokja is just keeping it 100 if they wanted to live they couldve gone out and put the work in instead following a prick who just talks all the damn time dokja earned his coins he owes nothingwhy do they want a refund? i mean they bought it and ate itüíÄi mean think about it. what would happen in the long run, it's just like that saying you can give a man a fish but, you can teach how to fish and hell fish for the rest of his life. it's not exactly like that but in the future they won't have enough coins either and he can't just keep giving them coins that will get him killed.yk i love it when characters drop the good deeds and decide that they don't wanna deal with any of the bs. he's also got a point as well and yeah majority of the people were asses anyway who killed to survive in the first scenario but now they're all going up to dokja and beg him for coins and shit. im excited to see where this is going, and him slicing the dude's arms? man i've never been so satisfiedreally love dokja so much sick and tired of mcs who are like ‚Äúohhh yeah i‚Äôm a good guy lets share some shit‚Äù he is like nah bitches not happening lmaodokja believes in justice so hes right to ask why. if u have bad intentions why should he help[the constellation of gamer god is overly pleased with dokja's decision. donates 700 coins.]he's so hotthis is why i love dokja ü§£‚ù§Ô∏èif its not just me but why do i feel like dokja is not normal either?‚Ä¶ from the start where he instantly knew how to use his bookmark and hi calm demeanor while facing people deaths, its not normal. it feels like he knows something but i couldn‚Äôt explain.oh yey ~ there's a difference to logic and morality. thats why philosophers always grind their brains with ethics coz they have different values and principles. with survival as the main objective, being charitable kills even the recipients, not just the giverbihyung is back lol but he looks so cuteeven i'm scared and pleased to his decision. it's just so good that the author makes the plot twist excitingdokja's decision was realistic (idk the right term for that) bcs i mean, they are all fighting for survival. being righteous and kind would actually bring them nowhere. or something like that dang i should work on my vocabularyomg im so in love with his attitudethat last panel. chills.mc so bad assthis is refreshinghyeongseong is a big softiehahah i like how his arms got chopped off. .........they are saying that he is a bad guy but all of the survivors are  bad people for what they have done so they shouldn't even say a person is bad because their is no good peopledokja lookin' hot there wtfam i the only one who missed the dokkaebi and thinks its cute??no? just me?? okayüòëok damn that was hothe's kinda like a prantagonist.i would have just murdered anyone who tried to take the coins. no moral high ground in this universe. screw you inhothey want to get coins easier than accomplishing the scenariosthe best way to describe dokja is \"dark heror\" thought their methods are cruel, they always do what's justice.this is exactly what i expected him to do in the previous episode... people should learn not to blame others for their errors (eren like)[late reader is reading in class]this is actually a depiction of the sad reality, people will blame you for their own misfortune. they will ask you things and if you wont give it to them, they will blame you for the things they couldn't attain bc of the loss of that 'something' when in fact, they could've made a way to get that 'something'. dokja is so hot grrrrrokay look if he gave them coins just for free. like he‚Äôs not getting anything in return free. he‚Äôs giving them a free pass. they will end up just sitting there with their hands outreached waiting for you to put the next thing in their palm. they have to earn it. even now, you have to work for everything. so like they‚Äôre not just gonna be given a free pass. even the child was like ‚Äúim not gonna be useless‚Äù and got skills to help. and actually helped. that‚Äôs not a lack of morals or empathy[the constellation lazy ass reader is clapping their hands because of your decision][the constellation, \"the righteous

i don't f*cking care if you die. only me and my friends can survive for (almost) free~!\" like oh my god~! xd... he is like an anti hero(?) or like one of those people you think are more logical than moral(some villains?) but are actually the main character(aka dr.stone)[the constellation wings of ciel is pleased with your decision] you have been gifted 50 coins aaaaa hes so hoti am really really happy for dokja he turned it out amazingly i am waiting for the next episodeüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäfck yes!dokja woke up and chose violence and i love itbro that sword is so coolthis is is just too good, i've spent my night reading this.üò≠don‚Äôt these people know it was their choice to buy food from him? you can‚Äôt get your money back with out giving the product back. dummiesgoooo dokja!! he doesn't owe them anything when they treated him so badly >:((dokja kinda looking like a psycho at the end there.... and i kinda i like it....the secret is that the coins they use is the coins us readers use to buy fast passesüòâdammmmnnnn dokja, you rule!i agree with dokja's logic. why should someone that killed someone else, to save themselves, get coins from him for free. what makes them so deserving of the coins. also the food he had he'd gathered for himself and was even willing to sell it to them. they were not obligated to buy it nor was it his fault when it disappeared.honestly i would do the same in this situation. being pushed around by the incite ability can only go as far as you let it...dokja just killed a strong monster...what are these puny humans gonna do to him? lol gtfohe's simply just thinking about his own future, there's nothing wrong with that, people already do it in this world (but are more corrupt about it) damn manz tryna live dude,i thought he would tell them that the glasses clown has 8,000 coins, but this might be better, since even if all of these people manage to get past this round, they're guaranteed to die on the next round anyways lolfinally a character not scared of anything, take their arms off king!why should you share you grabbing other people shit without asking to borrow it this guy is a smart dudeyou know what? this is kim dokja , the best mc ever. and for novel readers, did dokja acted like this in the novel? i don't remember clearly but i think he was not that angry. i really really want this to get turned into an animei got where he's coming from if he gives those ppl the coins that's equivalent to giving all the clothes off your back in the dead of winter and you die and they still in trouble. it benefits for a sec but it didn't truly help. i kind of like the route his character is taking a lawfully good character would have been supremely irritating because they would continuously sacrifice themselves without thinking of the personal repercussions. just like an avg. person he's neutral preserving.oh my god i'm loving this so so much and it's getting better every single episodemental note: don't ask dokja for anything or i might lose my handshe risked his life to get those coins, and what did y‚Äôall do? just sit around in the station expecting someone else to do the work for you.dokja has hit his point i like this character... so awesome i like itthese comments literally sound like constellation commentary lol. but dokja really is an interesting character because he has a lot to deal with. pleasing the constellations, trying to stay alive, while also helping others. it‚Äôs really unfair because he has worked really hard for his coins while other people do nothing and just expect the coins to be handed to them. gosh this whole comic is amazing! ‚ú®king‚ú®. periodtwell that was hot *nosebleeds* you see nothingif dokja decide to side with that high moral to help those people, he will defintely get trapped in cheon inho plan. just like if you being kind to the people for one time, they will ask you another kindness. thats how human do, even in the our world. and inho want that for his own selfishness and so he can using and  controling dokja. thats why, what dokja do here is right. that last panel tho. üëåüèªyaaass im so satisfied with his decision. not everyone deserves your own kindness. just gotta show em what u r truly capable of which enough to dread others and back off.legit wanna hear dokja's voice and the action asfkjfdlüò≥ if this turn out to be an anime... üôä there's no word can express my mind. see this is why i couldn‚Äôt survive in an apocalypse. i‚Äôm too nice the lawful neutral best clift hanger ever...this is definitely going to be an anime the way this story is progressing and the twist and turns they‚Äôve made so far and it‚Äôs only been 24 chapters 10/10yes yes yes i love this scene (what comes after is so great honestly so satisfying)biyungs reactions on the indirect messages is so kawaii[ the constellation 'one who knows the story' is excited for those who don't know what happens next] he is a anti-heromy man went from midoriya to kirito real quick really thinking about buying the fast pass now. this is hype afi think i would make the same decision, considering the coins.i would ask, and i would make decisions.ya know what would be really awesome?! if dokja just killed the leader and took his coins. i'm really liking this series! thanks for your hard work!dokja has impressed me by showing how smart and calm he iswhat those fools should of known is that everyone has a breaking point and his just got destroyedi'm glad that dokja isnt gonna put up with this pricks bull anymore. it makes me happy to see hes not in a gaming moodremembers how people usually ask for scope the day before an exam and the aducity to ask for stationery the hour before exam. me: why should i?best character ever‚ú®the apocalypse blame gamefinally, the snowball plushy mini demon is back, not that other bratthe constellation [piper_thepotato] is very impressed with your performance. she decides to gift you [10 coins and a token of appreciation]. she also says thank you for replinishing her sanity.dokja's squad shouldn't return back to the camp. they can just survive on their owndaaanggg! someone cover the kid‚Äôs ears this is about it get even uglier.after reading the webnovel i can‚Äôt begin to tell you how happy i am with this! seeing it in picture is one thing now we just need a studio to bring it to life!dokja be like-\"i don't give a fuck\"i love how he doesn‚Äôt care, if i were him, i‚Äôd do the same cause why should you care when these ppl are all selfish bustards?damn how i hate these people in storys who only blame others. like that wont help or solve the problem. mc has no friggin bussines giving them free coins and then die himself like... bruhi did think he would pull out his sword but i did not expect him to cut off the dude's hands jsjsjjsjsjsi feel like the mc is going to become more of an anti hero you know kinda like deadpool but a little more sanedoes anyone know how their names are pronounced? (especially gilyeong)me being a huge fan of rpg‚Äôs i‚Äôm really interested to see how our little group of characters changes, not only emotionally but their skills and items tooi 100% agree with my mans over here. 1 billion iqhmmmm... i‚Äôd say he‚Äôs a lawful neutral. still does good things and follows the law, but like, he‚Äôs really only in it for himself (and maybe a few others if he cares about them enough) (although that‚Äôs probably not that likely)ok but dokja that was kinda hot ngl üôàwhat about the business man???? he got like 8 million (or thousand) coins from the curse thing didn‚Äôt he?i love dokja even morebadassi was so interested in this webtoon that after reading the last episode i went ahead and read the webnovel lolwhy the hell he needs to share? this is apocalypse, he gained his coins slaughtering demons. he doesn't need to share it with some man only sitting in the corner safely. i would do the same with one exception; i would spare kids. pov: you don't remember the actual main character's name they may think he was acting villain, but no, he's just being logical and i like it.dont worry bro you can open your character status in like 200+ chapters :)i‚Äôm so glad dokja didn‚Äôt do what other people would deem the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing. those people are hypocrites. especially that whats-his-face. he should die firsthuh come on even the lil kid is using his survival skills. it's high time these people understand. dokja way to go boy. man, i really dislike inho cheon. i think dokja is doing the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing (we‚Äôll see exactly what he plans next chapter)... he didn‚Äôt take those coins from anyone, they willingly paid because they wanted the food he originally collected himself. and he brings up a good point that all these people who are alive now *most likely* killed someone in the first scenario to survive. i can‚Äôt wait to see how the characters develop, especially huiwon! also can‚Äôt wait to see what fate belongs to inho!who would give out coins to help killers survive like who the hell they think they area lot of top comments are saying \"everyone there had to kill in the first scenario\" but like, there are clearly young children & older people present. maybe they got lucky and had a different scenario, bc i don't remember dokja or dokkaebbi saying the first quest was the same for all users, but also, even if it was the same, maybe some of them had similar solutions to dokja in that scenario? and the comments are saying it's pragmatic to let all those people die, i disagree, that's eugenics. (1)i need coins too üòú to read any further..lolall this time i thought the dokaebbi eyes were just hollow sockets when in reality he‚Äôs got these cutesy bubble eyes üò≠damn, he really said bye bye to that guys arms. i like how different dojka thinks. im quite interested to see what he does next. i can't deny it, that guy was good at manipulating people at the right time. he knows when to use his powerful enchanting words. that was a nice battoujutsu. i like this episodeomg i think i have a crushdokja : hello, my name is dokja and i'm chaotic neutral, nice to meet you.dokja that's dark....... i like it hehehe.the color of his words are as ice cold as he is ryt now lolread the web novel guys, it is srsly amazing and you will not regret it. i couldn't wait for more of the webtoon so i started the novel and i have been reading it non stop for the past three days coz it's so good. i keep trying to recommend it but it feels just like when dokja tried to recommend twsa and no one listened to him. :') yk, this is a very interesting turn of events üëÄaaaand now we have a psychopath as the thumbnail for a week being kind is good, , but being a pushover isnt. all those ppl would die anyway because they are bad players. so dojka would only kill himself for nothing... he made the correct decision when the world gets bad enough, the good go crazy... but the smart, they go bad. he just stated, clearly, no to socialism. just dokja being  dokja at this moment they should know they f*cked up.they do realize they are trying to say they deserve coins and then attempt to murder their only chance at survival! plus they don't even know killing him will give them back their coins!i need coins tooooo :'>>yasss dokja slayss ‚ú®‚ú®[the constellation ‚Äúi want sleep‚Äù is amused at the sight of you putting others in their place][the constellation \"the shadow scholar\" is surprised by how gullible these people are.]that villain is dangerous and cunning. he turns everything against you, including your actions and words.genius. kill someone then take your coins back by having to touch fingers where the person transferring coins has to think. absolutely brilliant!i would rather be a villain who does good sometimes than be a heroyass i had to same he very logical character and puts himself first mf went sicko mode üíÄi'm not even halfway through this webtoon but i just know this is going to be one of my favouritesif u want your coins back give the food back or did u eat it already???constellation 'broke reader' is satisfied with the amount of head rubs dokja is giving gilyeongcrissy wake up i don't like this. üòÄright decision dude, dokja is not your typical saviour protagonist. lolall i could say is slaydokja i love you very much dasurrrvv ahabshsjjdhssudokja's character ‚ú®ü§åüèªhe kind of look like sung jin wooi‚Äôm liking dokja. he‚Äôs being smart and realistic in this situation. yesssssss i like the kind but logical mc, he's kind but he's a human, he must be kind to himself and the people he care first before random people who just want to leech ‚ù§hes right. he risked his life for those coins. and he better not give them to people who just sat there and complained. as said before, age or gender doesnt matter here, u can just upgrade ur stats instead of complaining abt not wanting to diedokja is karma incarnate. you reap what you sowthat was a wise decision dokja üëèi am very sick because of the development of the dokja character üôÉ it making the situation more interesting day by day ü§†he‚Äôs being realistic. i mean these people are murderers and can‚Äôt even pay for the sin the committed. dokja went out of his way and earned these coins so why should he give them? he would just make lose. and what would these people give him backin return? nothing. he‚Äôs not all goodie. it‚Äôs an apocalypse a fucking apocalypse. crazy people üíÄ. he wants to survive. everyone wants to survive. you should be (held) responsible for you own live. they are all moral incorrect (inc. dokja) protag who doesnt care about moral high ground woof woof woof üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èothers: give me back my coins!!!   /  dokja: suck my ass the absolute irony of making the beginning villain a literal edgelord just to pull the same garbage with your main character,even if he did give them coins they would be monkeys and stay in the station and die the next day anyway -_- bruhanyone : sharing is caring,,,, dokja : i don't get paid enough to carethat's right! show them what kind of people would be like in the future! aggressiveness and despiration!these people have the audacity to think that they can kill someone and then beg for their lives like.... btw has anyone realised that there is another little kid there with his mum? r u telling me he killed somebody too????? dang.....i would of done the same and i would say that if you aren't going to risk it for the biscuit then you are unreliablei love how the kid is just holding his skull weapon so calmly while watching a mans arma get cut offüíÄwait‚Ä¶ i just realized that people would have automatically completed the first round, as the body regenerates cells and others die off constantly. and a cell is a living organisim, right?if these people want to survive so much then they should probably go and do something instead of expecting to leech off of people who go out and earn their survival like dokja does.yes let's go dokjaaaaa!!! i really love his character, it's a breath of fresh air i'm so happy dokya isn't the stereotypical good-two-shoes. i'm so tired of seeing main characters doing things out of guilt and morals, especially if they're not obligated to.i mean... you want coins but do nothing to help? it's a tought world you live in, you gotta earn the right to livedeath note vibes right nowi love dokja glad he's not a dumb mc, actually love his villain side loldokja: \"joey doesnt share food >:(\"he's... a villain... a smart one... that protects his comrades....\n",

on top of many already having shown to be straight up bad guys, particularly those led by the gang leader dude, so not only is it not a stretch to assume these people aren't as innocent as they seem but it's also very likely that they weren't lucky and killed some bugs like dokja's group did. which considering what dokja's thoughts have been, this is exactly what he's thinkingthe man snapped lmaogod dayum, double cheeked up üò©üò≥dokja showing them what‚Äôs up!\n",

everyone's gangsta until dokja shows up.next week needs to be here tmmrüò≠üò≠it‚Äôs the apocalypse, at a certain point it‚Äôs everyone for themselves ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èjust a reminder to all the people who want him to share because \"it's the right thing to do\" all of these people begging for coins are murderers, and it's not like he's obligated to help them either just because he is the main character.my man dojka is going for that chaotic neutral/evil routesavage dokja!!!!!!!!!!!  i admit it i am bored of all good and soft main leads i want something worth and here comes dokja the savage king  ( actually in real life everyone is selfish)blood for the blood godeveryones coming up with big brain comments and i'm here like lol dokja's hoti love this sword!!!!! it makes me feel like im welding a idk just......something good ya knowdaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that was sick!kill them all!i hadnt thought of the first scenario like that. they all killed someone else to be here and thus nullifies any reason to even attempt for a moral high ground. most of dokjas group killed insects and remains, for the time being, non murderers. very interesting.it's easy to say this cause it's a fictional story but not everyone was gonna survive anyway. why not just get rid of the pricks and assholes like thisthe decision he take might be seem wrong but tbh if i was at his place i would do the same thing i guessyeah cut their asses!! that's mah boy!!i would have had them compete for the coins. like top five get a loan for the survival fee and maybe i‚Äôll let them join me or fight for me later to pay it back their debt. pahahahahaha i love psycho dokja hahahahaha!is there no one mention about how gilyoung-ee calling dokja? :') in the novel, he call dokja \"hyung\" since he is younger than dokja. maybe it's better to change how gilyoung-ee call dokja in the next episode.they fucked up they fxcked up they fxcked up my mans went off. not like they can cancel him.i like the scans translation of the last scene more. it was more epic and cool which got me excited for the next chapters. \"this mess you're all in . . . . . do you really think it's my fault?\" goosebumps all over my body after that line.finally! i'm sick of these people who just wait for help and do nothing. that inho cheon too. his character is disgusting. people like him never admit their mistakes and push the blame onto others all the time while making it seem that they're a saint. despicable. i agree with dokja. those people are being pretty selfish. even though they want to survive they can't be aggressive and start asking for a refund of what they already ate. so....too late people üíÄooh it's starting to get interesting teehee üòÜüòÜaye yo!!!i screamed out loud when he cut his arms off! he‚Äôs serious! imagine you attack someone and they whip out a sword and chops your hands off ah a normal dayyes suddenly the apocalypse is turning into a double apocalypse he can‚Äôt give all these people coins everyday just to survive. dokja has no real obligation to these people. they never saved his life, he only profited off of them, and the only people he really has ties to is the people in his party. so i stand by his decision.bihyeong is backüò≠‚ù§Ô∏èoofhe does have a point. everyone there is likely a murder and the people who tell him to be a good person are the worst ones. well they are the one who demand food and now they are putting the blame on dokja...wow such a pathetic humansüòïi want to see the thug leadee dieüòèi want to see the thug leadee dieüòèhe gonna kill that blonde and when he does i‚Äôll be laughingwell he did nothing wrong , everyone who managed to make it here killed somebody but did not have the guts to carryon and earn their living, so no one has any obligation to meet their demands . if he lets them survive now by giving in , they will only die next round because they are incapable of surviving on their own. thats  a wasted investment okay that went from 0 to 100 real quicki highly doubt dokja is gonna let the random kids die. if he does then the support of his allies goes down the gutter and most the constellations gonna hate him.i love this series the constellation dania twilight is laughing her teeth off due to the evil face of the incarnation dokja kim. the constellation dania twilight is too broke to gift you 5 coins. 5 coins, please i just need 5 coins to buy the next episodeugh i love main characters like this bc the plot is so interestingdokja, i getchu bud, that's the exact reason why i don't like to play a hero. every person will ask u about ur morals... i have read this novel til the end just incase you know. survival of the fittest bitchesdokja looks more handsome when he's being mean are interested to see your moves .to me dokja seems like a good guy but instead of giving handouts he‚Äôs teaching others to be responsible for their actions and in his own ways helps his friends enjoy this type of kim dokja while you still can :)this man is going to throw handsboi this world is twisted now and days so survival is the way to go not that i 100 percent agree with dokja but still..... i love the twistsy e s.where did those huge drumsticks go? ü•∫we get dokja is a badass, and the other people are idiots, but is no one going to talk about hyeonseong lee and his sheild? it's so sparkly.hehe im excited to see everything illustrated. i recently picked up the novel and am on chapter 107, things haven gotten extremely interesting. i recommend giving the novel a try if you ever have spare time ^^badass!!this is funholy shitscary but real f*ing cooldamm he's neutral i don't know why people mad. he can't look after others with no disregard to his own life. in my opinion people should never be blamed for doing what they need to do to survivei love dokja's character ain't like some typical protagonist with golden heartthis is a prime example of a good protagonistyeah bitches. stop free loadingthere's a lady with a little boy, i hope he does share some coins with them though *v1g0* is fascinated by your story and is waiting for new episodes (he have no coins :'v)is it me or dokja's really hot with that swordjust like the people in this current chapter, i need coins!!!love it. novel plot is really good and now the drawings? i dont deserve this one bitcharacters like dokja are my favorite :3everyone: its his fault!!dokja: lemme tell you somethin...lemme tell you somethinremeber communism works in theory, but when put into practice it fails horribly. everyone at the shelter should know thatuno reversed that green shirts threat!ooh~ dokja is so tenseyes boy, ask for some respect if i may, her skill reminds me of hisokas bungee gumüíÄunbroken faith in action looks absolutely stunning.he is taking a very interesting route had it been me i would have also refused to disclose little to any information as well fearing that it would cost my life however im kind of concerned to his development as an individual because in the beginning he was shy and seemed nice enough now he has become nearly similar to the regressor and its quite hard to hd anything against him when any other person in his shoes wouldve done the same bihyeong i missed yougreat chapter! dokja's character is super interesting. i'm very excited to see how this scenario ends.but i‚Äôm just a kidüò≠if i was grown and had lots of mobey i would turn this into animedokja is soo cool!!!i rate it ;   100000000/100lowkey the big ego dudes fault cause he built a community that became like thati know that the crowd of people are heavy hypocrites but i really can't blame them. they're just trying to survive by buying food and \"asking\" for help from people who can help them. it's just a survival instinct. and also, imagine if you were in that situation. you don't have powerful friends, maybe you're not very good, you don't have a good constellation, and you're broke. most importantly, you're not the main character/protagonist in the story at all. so you have to live. it's just pitiful.i love it.  this character us going closer to the chaotic neutral side. but sticks firmly in true neutral. this way in terms of dnd allinment checks, he could instantly alter his actions to output a spicific looking outcome. like he looks true chaotic evil then 3-4 (maybe 8 if your pushing it) episodes later he is neutral(he need to get to the alignment slowly.)  and slowly he looks like the ideal lawful good protagonist instead he is a neutral character who is on for the ride.cant wait for kim dokja whipping those bastard assesomg getting these updates is always one of the highlights of my study-filled week. i'm really interested to see how dokja turns out. i love the direction it's going in right nowyeeeeeesssss we love a morally grey characterjudgment time! kim dokja is awesome xdonline school/home work can wait. the child's life is more important!! must protecc‚úä‚ù§god i love it  when character don‚Äôt take any sh√Æt üòå dokja is an ultimate savage loli just wanna binge thislook at those happy blushing face, lee hyunseong is such a dorklet's go dokja!!!! whooooooooo!!!!protecc bby gilyeong. my bby leemans speakin' the teuth, they all killed on the first round and everything they did up til then was their choice, so they can't really blame amyone but themselvesdokja has a point here, while he obviously wants to help he doesn't owe these people anything. if they failed the test they failed the test, he doesn't have to sacrifice his life for the sake of somebody else.people: erase my foolish decisions and give me coins again so i don't suffer my own consequences! dokja: no ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüó°Ô∏èüó°Ô∏ècan;t he just finish the scenario and save everyone from paying?dokja is added to the list of dark haired mc's i simp for thank you creator for my birthday giftüò™‚ù§i'm i the only one that finds the cotton ball thing cute‚Äú...oh his arm got cut off. huh.‚Äùdokja you lit üí™he didn't  have does kinds of morals he just didnt want to stand out but was forced to do so by a jackass with the power to manipulate the masses i‚Äôd kill someone for more coins to read ahead in this webtoon üòêi really want this to be turned into an anime, it would be so good viva la revolutionbut it kinda made sense. all those people survived because they killed someone... and now that they can‚Äôt even manage to survive on their own.you prick. that t man is soo pathetic i cant stand ityou know what i like about dokja? he's not like your usual mc who wants to save everyone , who doesn't want anyone to die, who wants to be the hero. he's not really sympathetic, and he sees things as they are. e.g. these people were shit to me before, so why should i help them? do they deserve my help? he wants to do what's best for him, just like they all do, except that he's not leaching off of others, he's doing it himself. i really respect him as a character for that.some of you will die, but that is a sacrifice i‚Äôm willing to make he looked like a badass at the end just like a villain and i absolutely love itüíñi am so hyped for next episoderealistically speaking most of these people are going to die anyway. maybe not today or even tomorrow, but they won't last with the monsters. as a whole most people are weak. they look for easy ways out and for others to do for them. giving the money back or paying their way for 1 more day only prolongs the inevitable, and leaves you with even more people begging tomorrow. this decision had to be made sooner or later. this series is so amazing!! i‚Äôm so excited every tuesday after a hard day at work to read this!counter offer: nodokja... you bastard. that was too badass.u go dokja! i missed you dokkaebi! (if that was the spelling lol)dang, dokja is ice cold.*insert evil giggle* if words don't work they bout to talk to these ‚ú®hands‚ú®what a badass protagonistwill i get killed if i say yes?question for people who read the manhwa gilyounge's stance in the last panel shows he is ready to throw hands for his new father figure.hell yeah, no stupid goody-two-shoes here babyhe could of shifted it to the rich annoying guy i dint remember the name of whi kill stealed to get 8k coinsdokja did the right thing you can‚Äôt blame some one for everything, game is game i get excited when he cut off that m*ron's hand, can't wait >‚àÜ decision]he looks so badassüòªüòªüòªüòªomg slayyyythat one guy who has over 7000 coins be like $$$[the constellation 'queen of broken heart' is very pleased by the incarnation kim dokja action]see, this is what i'm saying. omniscience has a cost, and that cost is that every interaction you have, down to the smallest level, is an equation. you just need to solve for the best possible outcome, and it doesnt matter what that takes or gains, because its deffinitionally best. it's basically blue orange morality.tbh i don't like the heartlessness but at the same time i know damn well id do the same thing honestly it's hard to judge this situation bc he doesn't know if everyone there actually killed someone(some could've had the same idea with the bugs) but at the same time its most likely they didi love his character right nowhyeonseong omgüòñüòñüíñthe leader of the major group is so manipulative i dont think any of the about to die characters tried it, but if they had some coins left, just not enough for the survival fee, i might have been tempted to negociate with dokja to an exchange, in order to die with a full belly. like the last smoke, but instead a last steak...i know they probably have to do that but i laugh every time i see the notice of depictions of violence... like... you should have written that into the manga description. it's in almost every chapterüòÖ.god damnü§ûü§ûblushin like a maniac rn ü§≠ü§≠what kind of dummy rushes someone with a sword? personally‚Ä¶ who even cares bout these people? they‚Äôre bloodthirsty as soon as things turn sour, and they can‚Äôt see that the obviously evil leader is in the wrong here. üòíedit: and if you want to survive in an apocalypse situation like this, you have to figure out a way to survive. being a mindless background group-thinker is a surefire way to die. ingenuity is the way to go.ha. people with no moral tryna be moral? loli really like how dokja doesn't try to compromise with everything in his way. pretty refreshing tbhi think this would happen when something like this happen . those people should start taking responsibility for their own after killing people from 1st round .damnnnn that was so damn good so satisfying üò©üò©yes dokja slay slay those bitchesyes good choice dokjaslay dokjai really like the constellations. they seem extremely cool. especially the prisoner.i'm happy he did that hyeonseong's reaction to the shield is pricelessahhh this feels so much better im tired of those characters who try to stay at society's standards you go dokjayay! morally grey characters are my favoriteyeah kinda...i love that he is not nice!amazing story and art, please support the author/translatori agree with dokja, they're in a position where they have it make an effort to survive and it's the law of the chain (strong and weak ones) and he doesn't have to share his coins, that he collect with his and team effort. also, you share once and they'll keep coming all the time, cause they want the easy way...so agree totally with dokja... he's not wrong or baddeserve so muchyesss ugh that was satisfying...**slice** oh your arm hit my blade, congrats you've lost a couple of pounds loseryou seem confused, you don't have power over him because he can't kill every. single. one of you... you had power over him because he didn't want to. that white thing are cute lol yet scaryso should i just ignore that there was no comments for the past few chapters?whats so bad becoming a villain?oh yeah. things are starting to get interestingbihyeong is taking me out üò≠üò≠dokja's character is interesting than most protagonists i've ever seenwait hold on. aren't we, the readers, the constellations in this case????he unlocked the rinnesharingan thats all i gotta say[constellation \"the fox\" nods at dokja's decision]han myungoh had around 8000 tho-que delicia finalmente um enche lingui√ßa dessa apanhando morality doesn‚Äôt even exist in this world anymore, it all depends on the person‚Äôs values. and dokja‚Äôs got pretty unpredictable values, im sure he cares about the people he considers his team now, and he even saved huiwon without expecting to gain anything in return, which is odd cause he‚Äôs been doing things for his own benefit. he also lied to gilyeong so he‚Äôd still have some hope/optimismgod, i'm loving dokjaman i love this, but it makes sense, since his whole thing is like \"i'm not the protagonist, so why should i be a hero?\"gileyeong has a power to communicate with animals how cooolhe is soü§åüèªthe constellation [mrhekko] loves the mche should at least give the coins back to the people that bought food. he knew they would charge coins to live and took advantage. not cooli like it dokja kim ... sharing is caring my ass idk but i like dokjaright decisionno hesitation... i like ityeeessss go tell em bruhhyou know, i feel sorry for the small children. unless their parents held someone/something down and mental scarred by having them kill; the children died. dokja makes jin woo look like a saint lmaohe is starting to look slowly but surely like sung jin-woomorally gray characters, like eren(aot),are really interesting for me... it's great to have new types of characters from time to time.bihyeong really turned from:üëπüòàü§®üî™üí£ to this: ü•∫üòóüòÅü§óüòáduck morality. i love a hero which can very well be a villain honestly, i would be selfish too if i was in this situation, and only give coins for the people that i actually cared about im glad dokja's not tryna be the \"good guy/hero\" bc if i was in his position i wld not wanna share any of my coins eitherwe live the dokja character development üí™dokja kinda reminds me of ainz ooal gown from overlord. i love him i might change my nameoh he got cakeit just had to be the praying mantisdokja‚Äôs i nice guy people: pls share coins \"riot  happen they blame him\" i'm going to kill you with one of the sickest smilesim hookedsharing is caring to thoes only who deserves it dokja really just said: *no cuz i happened to miss the part where i cared??

      "idk about anyone else but i was like finally my goddd!!!!!greatt character development so realistic and not idealistic tbh i would prob do the same. being a good person is cool now but in a situation like that it‚Äôs jst being weak. it‚Äôs jst letting others manipulate u for personal gain. at that point i would sorta jst be like ‚Äúfuck it‚Äùyes finally a character whos not a bitch! this is why i loved solo levelingfinally, he is all out of mercynice i like that they are just evilhe has every right not to give them coins, they killed ppl. he can use that as an excuse if he doesn‚Äôt wanna seem evil cuz he killed bugsi think children at least deserve your help, but at the end it's a survival of the fittest scenario, not a charitymost of the people there killed other people to survive so why should he give coinsi like the way dojka just helps people that actually does need it and i honestly love the way he is not stick on being the good ass guy but instead a fair one literally loving it!!!!!dokja doesnt take shit, and i love it so much. pathetic humans....used all their coins and blame someone else for their stupidity. trash deserves to be destroyedits the apocalypse my dudes ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!i stand by dokjahe is doing the right thing. i don't see these people doing anything to live other than just *surviving*, there's a big difference. they took human life to get where they are now, 300 coins each, that's 3 more nights of life. or instead of squatting, they could, you know, work on the scenarios at hand. üôÑ ...dokja is taking the moral high ground.‚¢Ä‚£†‚£æ‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚£†‚£§‚£∂‚£∂‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚¢∞‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø\n",

      "Im happy with this twist im sick of characters who try so hard to stick to the moral high ground i‚Äôm really interested to see dokja‚Äôs developement at this point since he‚Äôs clearly not going to be a ‚Äògood‚Äô character i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be straight up evil but i‚Äôm excited to see the extent of his neutrality at the very least the people ‚Äúsharing is caring‚Äù dokja i don‚Äôt care ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è edit just to clarify i don‚Äôt disagree with dokja‚Äôs decision i just thought it was funny how people were trying to get him to maintain a high ‚Äúmoral ground‚Äù but he was just like nah this an apocalypse my dudesfinally a mc that makes the most optimal choice ive been getting bored of mcs always trying to be the herofor real though aside from the people dokja originally saved with the bugs everyone is a murderer they have a lot of audacity to be begging for their lives i‚Äôm down with dokja‚Äôs pragmatismwait i just noticed look at the panel when dokja cuts the guys arms you see that he is facing away from his group then look at the last panel you can see that he has his back now turned to the guy whose arms he cut off and his body is facing towards his group so that means that this man just cut the guys arms off turned around and then look over his shoulder to flex on all these people xdthis really is gonna be the best webtoon on the app and if they end up making an anime adaption you know it‚Äôll go crazyi really like the approach to an antihero type of character it‚Äôs nice to see someone who is intelligent but doesn‚Äôt magically make all the right decisions it makes him seem really human mostly fending for himself great work author please keep it up them gimme coinsdokja whythem ugh let‚Äôs just kill him and take the coinsdokja mistake slashthem pikachu surprised facei guess the guy at the end there was ‚Äúdisarmed‚Äù eh ehhhhlol why didnt he just let everybody know about the k coins the cursed guy with the suit hascrowd give me a refund dokja sorry there is a no refund policy give us coins dokja i missed the part where thats my problem this webtoon along with solo leveling is all i am looking forward to every weekcrowd let me get thatdokja its gone cost you an arm and legthey had time to complete the quest but they where sitting there all that time just crying about it and now its his fault pathetic pretty sure sangah has ariadne as her constellation ariadne is sometimes seen as the goddess of mazes and is credited with giving theseus a ball of string to find his way out of the minotaurs labyrinth  i mean that was so iconic from that story it just seems too coincidental i dont know if a japanesekoreanchinese  myth involving string exists to provide an alternative i honestly think that his decision is the goodone he needs verification that anyone he gives coins to will at least be able to offer something to him in exchange if they dont then they wouldnt be surviving very long anyways if he helped them it would probably just make them suffer longer with no hope of actually surviving and acclimating to the new world order i mean they couldnt muster  coins dokja gets that much as a gift from the constellations all the timethe first theme being original sin would that mean the second theme is survival of the fittest he wouldnt be doing any of them a favor by handing out coins for free as they would be bound to the other guy they would rather take the easy path and just kill him when all they really need to do is offer either an item of their own or their services in future runs its how society is supposed to work in the grand scheme of things where all parties work at their own pace to contribute manager dude got k coins last chapter let him save the peoplem i think my favorite constellation is the secret plotterhes right he worked for his coins even with his knowledge he still had to accomplish those things to get an award  this webtoon touches a lot of areas in society and its great thank you author for amazing comic  i think the facts come down too no one has a moral high ground here like he said original sin they all murdered someone to be alive right now so the fact they expect some one to save them after that is ludicrous no one is good or evil here it‚Äôs just survival for survivals sakedokja is also not dokja i believe he is the omniscient reader otherwise he would cling to humanity and sins for example he would had tried to save as many people as possible but instead decided to let them choose their fates he knows what to do and how to do it instead of morals he thinks with the most logic very interesting and also very hard to stay on that path having the ability of the fourth wall also helped in move forward resistant to fear charm taunts very powerful indeedhe made a good point they all killed someone to get pass the first scenario even that little kid so if you dont take care of yourself then you dont deserve to live money grabbers jesus fcking christ the audacity of those assholesi cant wait to see inho cheon get whats coming to him üòå gonna be even more satisfying than watching little han boy become a mother ü§∞edit these arent spoilers this is just what i hope happensthrow myeongeh under the bus he‚Äôs got  coins nowi love it when the main character doesnt stick to moral values like theyre in the apocalypse and they expect people to still follow the moral code even tho most if not all of then already killed someone  i love love love dokja‚Äôs character i am incredibly sick of ‚Äúgood‚Äù characters that make stupid decisions because ‚Äúit‚Äôs the right thing to do‚Äù i‚Äôm fed up with the moral high ground obviously he‚Äôs not a bad guy either he‚Äôs just selfish and i don‚Äôt find anything wrong with placing your survival first he is not responsible for these peoplejean henri fabre was a french naturalist in the late s known for his books on the lives of insects if anyone‚Äôs curiousis it just me or does dokja get hotter with each passing episode i love how he looks i love how he doesnt take bull look at him hes one of the many reasons why my standards are skyrocketinggod im already so spoiled with this one episode a day lol easily my top  series cant wait for morei think the important thing here is regardless of whether or not sharing coins is the moral thing dokja not letting himself be manipulated is better in the long run leaving a mob under incite‚Äôs control will only hurt him in the end not to mention giving those coins would be like taking responsibility for those lives it‚Äôs too much for anyone to really bare people are saying that he wasn‚Äôt keeping a moral high ground or that the people were telling him to keep a moral high ground and he wouldn‚Äôt but i think that he‚Äôs still got a moral high ground these people the moment they were manipulated or had to think things through resorted to murder and that‚Äôs exactly what he expected of them so why give them coins why trust them i think that despite his looks saying ‚Äòneutral chaotic with evil‚Äô it‚Äôs more like ‚Äòlawful chaotic with a moral compass‚Äôi see dokja as a survivor not good or bad just trying to livefinally this mc action makes sense in an apocalyptic world hes not bad but smarti love how they try to attack him he fights back and their expression is surprised pikachu face i don‚Äôt seem to follow why people have been saying this makes them evil they threw their own lives away unable to beat their inner fear and even attempt to survive it would be a waste to save someone like that in fact i‚Äôd say saving them just to force them into more suffering would be the evil choice if they are unable to even try and survive for themselves why not just let their suffering end it seems cruel on the surface but dokjas got a point in not being too generous people who live passively and allow themselves to get manipulated by relying on charity and sponsorships wont survive if their supporters suddenly decide to leave them be its true in the scenario and in this reality toodokja is not the protagonist of twsa so he will have to take hard and clever decisions in order to survive this game till the endand its much more fun to see him not following the moral valueshe really does look like a villain in that lase slide its so awesome no wonder the constellations are interested in him coins just means you‚Äôre alive one more day to beg for even more coins it‚Äôd be a waste hopefully dokja mentions boss man‚Äôs moniesalso i love he gave hyunsung lee a shield and lee loves him now they‚Äôre bros gotta max out that affinitydokja an actually good main characterseriously as if he‚Äôs some high level monster that you can defeat and he‚Äôll just drop coins why don‚Äôt they just break some pottery and pray for rupees do they deserve my help its an important question he cant be expected to shoulder the weight of all these people through the whole apocalypse at some point they need to stand up for themselvesi love how the author sets dokja apart while inho says ‚Äúreturn the coins to the people‚Äù it sounds like he is doing it for the good of the people and dokja‚Äôs ‚Äúand if i refuse‚Äù sounds villainess but he‚Äôs the main character and it‚Äôs refreshing that he isn‚Äôt a morally bound person but at the same time hasn‚Äôt tipped too far off that has left him insane in this situation this is absolutely one of my favorite webtoons by far and i rarely read anything other than heartwarming and romantic webtoonsfirst they wanted free food next they were too scared to help him kill the giant rats for coins third when they came back they asked for free coins thinking that he would give after that they tried to kill him and expected him to be a sitting duck finally they have the audacity to be surprised that he sliced someones arms offhonestly i love dokja‚Äôs character he‚Äôs rational and doesn‚Äôt let his emotions take the reins over his decisions he‚Äôs the embodiment of someone going against the world‚Äôs corruption while not utilizing the common ‚Äúgood prevails‚Äù trope i‚Äôm % looking forward to his journeyhyunsung lee has started to trust youdokja hmmm i can use thisi agree with dokja there‚Äôs no reason for him to help these people specially in the situation they‚Äôre inthe mc did the right decision because if they can survive just that one scenario how will they survive the next one those people is so pathetic the mc help them for food then they will blamed him for losing of coinsüòëi don‚Äôt need sleep i need the next episodeyay a gray area characterpeople who rely on others too much usually drag down the whole group because they always expect you to save them and feed of the kindness of others in a survival situation you have to either drag them with you and risk getting the whole squad killed or you have to leave them behind to save those who are able to stand alone i think dokja made the right decision because it would mean hed have to take care of a bunch of people even in the future that is not a longterm solutioni feel like dokja is more rational than evil as people are saying he makes smart decisions and calls based on logic everybody is talking about the moral high ground and how hes evil when mans is making rational decisions and being smart hes neither good nor evil hes j a guy with a rational mindthis comics unreleased episodes are starting to make me agree with coins are poweri love dokja‚Äôs personality in my opinion he is correct this is the apocalypse and he isn‚Äôt obliged to help everyone everyone brought food because they were hungry it‚Äôs their own decision what does dokja have to do with it if they wanted coins earn it themselves it‚Äôs every man for themselves i love this author already theyre the first to actually show you when the veil of civilization is torn apart by apocalypse even after murdering another person to survive these people are acting dependant on others if they dont fend for themselves no one will fight for them anymore beautiful storytellingthats one the the reasons i really like this story the mc is quite different from the standar hero üôà ill support him as far as he dont betray his team üòåüëådam i caught up to quickly again i‚Äôm so happy that‚Äôs he‚Äôs releasing quickly and with great quality i‚Äôll keep spending coins as long as they keep coming people i know that there are some people who came here from the webnovel but for those of us who are reading it for thw first time on webtoon dont google anything about omnimicent reader because it will just most likely spoil the manwha for you like it did for meedit did anyone else love hyeonseongs face when he was holding the shieldthis is absolutely perfect dokja maintains logical thinking in a time where it would be necissary to do so so it actually makes sense he isnt a hero just a guy a lucky guy but a guy nonethelessnone of you can say that dokja isnt good he doesnt do bad things he just does what is needed to survive moral ground wont work in apocalyptic world he didnt use them he just simply did what was best for him so i really like his decisiondokja badassdokja in the end of the story fucking badassü•¥well this is real interesting dokja is a unique protagonist and i absolutely love italthough those background characters are hella annoying for being hypocrites their reactions and actions are all natural i mean who did expect this to happen not even dokja dokja is lucky enough to have knowledge about the overall situation  also its understandable as to why theyre afraid to go out for the quest i mean their families and friends didnt come back after they joined something like that true neutral character coming throughas a mother i say kill the greedy bastards and save the children but as a lover of apocalypse stories the kids would get him killedi am now a simp for dokja ü§öthey only show interest in dokja when they need something from him why should he share his coins with them he made the right call üò§you have me hooked dokja‚Äôs decision really gave a sense of reality to the comic most would make their characters be the ‚Äògood‚Äô guy stick to morals and would give themselves to save others dokja is a very  rational character and i am excited to see where his story leads him y did i have the biggest smile on my face when he said y should i give u any am i psychodokja really takes no ones shit and i think that‚Äôs what makes him such an awesome protagonist like yeah it‚Äôs cruel but considering the circumstances he‚Äôs got every right to refuse no one else has done anything that deserves his help it‚Äôs survival of the fittest people are bound to show their ugly sides no matter whatif i was one of the people there i would be desperate and honestly feel some resentment towards dokja but id also understand that he very much risked his life to get the food and coins he has and i dont have the right to demand him to give me some especially if i havent even tried to risk my life to get them myself so i understand if they feel frustrated but it should be more with themselves and the situation what dokjas doing is perfectly fine and realisticabsolutely love this antihero what a fresh twist looking forward to the lack of romance and high action packed chapter to followi love him hes not evil just logical and fairtheyre all using scrap metal bats tools and pipes as weapons with some waving bone weapons as the highest thing there and this mf pulls out a swordhe risked his own life to get the food of course he is not going to give it all out for freei like a lot dokja just because hes not pretend  to be like the hero or something like that hes just acting like the situation are and the instinct of survive the woman‚Äôs constellation has to be ariadne right like with the whole thread to get out of the dungeon thing is kinda like her and the labyrinth i mean why should he give them coins when they are threatening him i was wondering how they were going to portray the dokkaebi chat i must say i am thoroughly pleased i love the emoticons üòÇüíúthis webtoon is so amazing the art is some of the best ive ever seen it is so well done i love it the plot is awesome i normally dont like apocalypsethemed stories but this is amazing the characters are fantastic too especially dokja i love how realistic they all are i can tell how hard the authors worked on this and they did truly some of the best work ive ever seen well donedokja me too give me just  coins to know what happens next in the story and then give me  more and then  more and then  more then i will pay you back please i just want to see more of your surprising and amazing intellegence and decisions    second later  rip my arms god i wanna read more why cant this series just be over so i can binge it i love that hes not a hero i get tired of all the high morals and instead hes a survivor this comic is amazing what‚Äôs the old saying about jesus ‚Äúgive a man a fish he will that day teach a man how to fish he will eat every day‚Äù  giving them coins doesn‚Äôt solve the issue because what about the next day and day after that they‚Äôll need someone to help them rather help themselves these people complain about morality but dont hesitate to kill people for coins at leat dokjas transparent they all knew about the survival fee yet they still bought so much food that they didn‚Äôt have any left for the fee now correct me if i‚Äôm wrong but didn‚Äôt you get  coins for clearing the first situation they had enough coins there alone to survive two days but they bought large quantities of food in order to have it now doesn‚Äôt that sound like the sloth and fox sin gluttony and greed screw them dokja is definitely doing the right thing its funny how those people went from pleading for dokjas help to being completely hostile towards him talk about true colors huhunrelated but i swear to god i am screaming about this little boy gilyeong i love you so damn much i dont know what it is but something about him has just stuck in my heart since the beginning and every reaction with dokja just makes my head spin the big brother vibes are killing mehonestly it‚Äôs messed up that they‚Äôre all so dependent of dokja since he has the food and the coins like damn if yall want some then stop sitting around and get some yourself survival of the fittest and wisest am i right if your kid doesn‚Äôt have enough coins or food stop babying himher and teach them to survive not to depend on othersdude is a true capitalistdokja is such a badassin an apocalypse there could have been no better choiceleshgooooo im so glad hes not your typical hero he has his own sense of neutrality nd i love that damn it why is he so hotpeople can hate dokja all they wanti still think hes bae üò©‚ù§Ô∏è‚úãüèΩdamndokja is ‚ú®ÔΩÜÔΩâÔΩéÔΩÖ ‚ú®ah yes this is the type of mc i like üòåy didn‚Äôt he say that guy with the glasses have  coin just ask himüòÇhes using like a mythical max level weapon on level  villagers i love how people were trying to guilt him using morals and then literally two seconds later tried to kill himomniscient reader is the best thing on this universe i completely understand why he chose to do that if he wouldve chosen to give his coins out most of the people would die anyway and he would‚Äôve wasted  coins for no reason leaving him with way less coinsits funny how the same people willing to kill to survive are the same ones that ask for coins to survive like get your crazy ideas that world revolves around you under control dokja aint at fault for the fact u domt have survival fee after all u did was sit on your asses and wait for someone else to take care of youi really like where this is headed so many stories have the main character stick to the typical hero plot which there‚Äôs nothing wrong with because it always makes a good story but i really like how different this is it‚Äôs a way more accurate portrayal of the chaos and the human desire to survive people really wouldn‚Äôt be generous in this scenario it really is a fantastic depiction of survival of the fittestthe reason wednesdays exist omniscient readerdokja just became one of my  favourite mcsi like this so much i didn‚Äôt think he was going to kill someone but you got to do what you gotta do and it‚Äôs not some game this is actual survival you already payed for the food so no refunds this is a game of survival and you must think wisely i think everyone can agree it‚Äôs so refreshing to have a character who cares about others but also knows to look after themself first can‚Äôt wait to see how it develops further thank you author keep up the great workdokja‚Äôs character is what‚Äôs lacking in solo leveling limits i rly rly like dokjams character the whole series i believe is a gem that needs to be caressed slowly great job author hope it continues to prosper im a caring person but im siding with dokja they dont see that they allowed this situation and are still being manipulatedwhy do i feel like dojka is going to turn into a nuetural good charactercan i just say that sword is real nice dokja sold food for $ while inho sold his food for more why should dokja be responsible for all these people lifes if he isnt even part of the group if inho the leader shouldnt he be responsible for everyone people can lie about how much coins they actually have people already knew about this coin system early so shouldnt they have been responsible with their moneylook our favorite dokkaebi is backü•∞ü•∞ü•∞its not that he doesnt care at all he just knows that he needs those coins to survive later because he knows the relative future it is his life over others so obviously he has to choose himself no one is going to pay him back laterhyeonseong lee is the type of guy that would never cheat on you üòåanother thing i love about this is that his group stays by him they understand that he doesn‚Äôt owe these people anything and he‚Äôs not a bad person for refusing to give them food and money i‚Äôm glad that they aren‚Äôt falling for any of itdokja has made his way to my top  favorite badass manhwa characters sitting at # right behind sung jin woothis doesnt make him evil or even neutral as he points out no one here is good and hes resisting the evil manipulation of the incite powerlook ma no handswhy are people trying to get refunds for the food that they already ate lmao im with dokja you foolshow can they ask for a refund after they have already eaten the foodi stan dokja it‚Äôs not on him to save everyone do you boo boohe really just said  dont touch me or my family  at the last scenedaammnnn this is the character ive been looking fooorrr oh sweetcheese dokja imma go marry youüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠dokja is smart as hellgosh that kid is quite op oh cool sangah have some useful skill too woah so dokja can now collect information on the target character omg the cute evil dokkaebi bihyeong is back oh so the dokkaebi can use telepathy with dokja thats interesting lol the soldier hyeonsyeong is happy with his shield bruh this annoying guy again yes im waiting for you to make your decision too dokja deym he went full cold psycho thats so awesome he even cut that guys arm off clean im so proud of youit‚Äôs is time ladies and gentlemen this is what i call sweet fucking satisfaction everyone is like oh he doesnt have morals but thats not true his morality is just different in an alignment chart he would be lawful neutral possibly lawful good compared to everyone else he doesnt believe in giving away things for free the people could offer him something and he would probably agree that doesnt make him morallesshonestly dokja‚Äôs character development really resonates with me if i have been put at the edge of my life‚Äôs cliff numerous times hanging on with my teeth i‚Äôd be sick and tired of people‚Äôs shit toooh my‚Äî dokja is so‚Äî jfjdhskfhdjebdjdndj üî• üî• üî• üî• yes yes dokja worked so hard for his coins and he is without any sponsor why should he give them just because they think he shouldnt let them die they killed people without problem to survive the first scenario üôÑwtf he is hero for his friend  and villain  for others i love it üò±üò±üò± i love this types of character thank god he‚Äôs not like other main characters ü•∫üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è dude he‚Äôs so cool t^t is intrigued by dokjas choicesnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooo i read all the episodes this is one of those ones where they should make into a showyo i think dokja made the right decision it‚Äôs an apocalypse and he has his own to care for plus how many of those people would give up their coins if they were in his situation i‚Äôm pretty sure none of them would üòåit‚Äôs literally the apocalypse you live on by every decision you make and being nice isn‚Äôt going to keep you alive forever dokja did the right thing im honestly in love with dokjas characterdokja in the beginning of the webtoonim not smart or handsomedokja right now is the most attractive character everi smell anti hero development and im here for itüòädokja has shown us he‚Äôs considerate but he‚Äôs not a pushover either when this is your th time reading the comic and it still hasnt gotten oldwell if he would not have sold them food they would be already dead ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èim % with dokja in this why the hell he has to share his coins just because some random dude ask you lmao tbh ill do the same he doesnt have the responsibility for others lifes only for his own survival dokja is one of the best mc ive seen in a while love the line about the killing in the first triallike youre capable of premeditated murder but not to take care of yourself you dont even have to do everything alone you can team up if they didnt just stay in one place roughly % of them would be able to survivehonestly i would have behaved like that too dokja is not selfish just because he isnt being blindly selfless he is strategic because this world is all about survivali love how hes not our typical hero and is a human to be honest if i was in his position i probably wouldnt help them either its a dog eat dog world only the fittest will survive every man for himselfi like how he refuse he earn the coins with hard work and good thinking while those people are desperate to survive but they don‚Äôt think outside of the box like dokia in the first scenariodokja is good and evilyes mess them up do not i repeat do not let this sick ass bastered get away with thisits literally not his fault its like attack a stranger because they didnt want to help you with your problems its your life to deal with dokja is such a refreshing main character i feel like most mains are usually true good or true evil but so far id say hes pretty neutral hes so interesting and unpredictabledick leader hey bro dont you have the most coins everyone communism intensifieshonestly i‚Äôm happy protagonists should focus on their own survival it‚Äôs not realistic to expect someone to sacrifice themselves for a bunch of strangers not to mention ones who have killed innocents to survive forget morality this is spartathanks author how is this comic not popular you need to be appreciated author nice decision he worked hard for those coins those people should‚Äôve worked for coins when they clearly had the chance not leeching of someone else‚Äôs coins it is also not even his fault that they don‚Äôt have coins from not using it wisely so honestly don‚Äôt give me that shit üò§  fuck i love dokja sm i think dokja is doing the right thing even if the other people think he is being selfish  in a survival scenario you cant depend on others to save you the incite guy is banking on dokjas morality forcing him to play nice but survival is the goal not being likedariadne was a princess who gave someone theseus or daedalus i think her magical thread for them to escape a labyrinth im a super greek mythology geek so my theory is sangahs constellation might be ariadne or something its funny how they blame dokja for everything like did he forces you to buy the food or what dokja i‚Äôll give you the coins back if you can undigest all that food you bought from mehe handled that nicelyits funny how similar this is to real capitalism people always seem to demonize people with money because there  are needy out there and thus try to take their money through various means just a connection my brain madeoh shi turned him into overhaul ü§£ü§£pacifism is a point of weakness in a world where everyone has already killedive never bought any coins or tried to on this app but this story not only made to buy and look for coins but also the only one for which i use all those coins and thats saying something no sorry a lotttbtw i just love dokjas character the right balance of good and evil he knows when to be good and when not to be he doesnt follow common guide lines or general society morals which are dubious at times like thesei read it in the novel but i still get irritated and upset with this scene kim dokja may sound selfish but everyone else needs to be responsible for their own lives giving them fish for today wont help them tomorrow ironically i have ran out of coins so now i have to waitthe constellation the reader of a thousand webtoons gives dokja a bro fist of approvalare you jeanhenri fabre or something bahahahahahaha amazing üòÇaslal is really interested in every decision dokja make she has become a fan of yours here‚Äôs your five coin bro we all just people spending money to read will we all heard this qoute if you make this a game ill show you how its played  thats how exactly how he manage to not keep going to his game plan i love it and im still willing to waste more coinsstrong escanor vibes^¬∞^well at least this webtoon is  close to reality in terms of attitudeim done with hypocrite characters so always have those high values that sometimes it doesnt feel real at all i cannot express how much i love protagonists like dojka a person‚Äôs bound to get tired of mary sues at some point üòîi love moral grey points in post apocalypse i hate seeing the goody twoshoes in these situations its literally kill or be killed everyone there has taken a life so they dont deserve true sympathyall yall getting heated in the comments coz dokja aint fit your standards of high morality theyre all murderes lmao dokja raised a very good point on ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt even take responsibility for their own lives‚Äù so why would dokja be responsible for their lives‚Ä¶ yes it would be kind and generous of dokja if he‚Äôs willing to give it to them for free but for him this is survival of the fittest and he earned those big money because of his smart thinkingstrategy he has the right to refuse as selfish and cruel as it sounds them trying to leech on him forcibly and badmouthing him when they aren‚Äôt even‚Äî‚Äîbe nice and give these murderers you dont even know some of your life line and risk you and your own groups safety and survival to make these people who just sit in a corner till someone comes whom they can leech off on survive  hours then leech off on you again next time cuz youre nice yeah sure no shtpff to be completely honest i wouldve been worse in dokjas situation like i dont know why i should save them i dont mind being called the villain i just protect those people i value and im not about to risk nor sacrifice the chances of our survival to murderers i barely knowi love it when the mc is neither a hero or a villainbro wjy is he so hotim beginning to like this man i think i‚Äôm in love right now i would just mention that this fella right here killed a demon and got  coins as reward so one of your men now has enough coins to save everyone sheesshhh mah guy turn to erenok but bihyeong was so cute in that one panel xddhe watched his own hands wave him goodbye üëãüèª üòÇüòÇü§£üòÇi might sound wicked but i really liked how he reacted üòàim still not done reading the novel but dang i love dokjas character so much but once again none of these people tried to hunt monsters and complete the task like bruh theyre just a bunch of leeches and the spirit said that  coins will be drawn daily even if they had it for the night they wouldnt have any for the next night and they still wouldnt try to go kill monstersrn my favorite constellation is prisoner of the golden headbandthat moment when u are done playing the good guy routethis is definitely an interesting scenario nice to see bihyeong again toochaotic neutral lol well hes not evil bc all of these people are murderers too lol even worse theyre entitled ones who did it wo thinking in the first tasküò¨dokja is really right i mean they taken someone elses life for their survival and now they arent ready with their life to be taken thats so ridiculous lol dokjas a chaotic neutral typehe is being realistic tho im sick of mc who is always trying to be goody two shoes its an apocalypse who tf in their right mind would want to help others lets be reali think dokja is a complex morally grey character i like those typesam i the only one having a deja vu of kirito from saoits their fault that they dont have coins leeching off of other people and then blaming a guy who worked hard for his coins no thanks üôÑü§öüèºtheyre just pretending to have a high morality high morality yet illogical üôÑ buzzing excuses without even thinking justice should be served who cares about morality when it‚Äôs about your survival feels good to see a mc that doesn‚Äôt want to be a hero all the time‚Äúi want a refund‚Äù bruh you‚Äôre saying you want to uneat food you yourself had chosen to survive by tf lmaomorally grey characters are the most interesting imo im interested to see how dokjas personality and choices influence the original storygod mode has been activated that dude deserved it tbh that sword just cut through flesh ligaments veins and fricking bones in just one clean slice thats literally impossible its an upswing toohyeongsong lee is so üòçüòçüòçdamnnn dokja is seeming to be more malevolent now even the art is making him look evil wonder if his allies will keep supporting him though they didnt seem like theyd want to share their coins either sangah seems reminiscent of ariadne from the greek myths so im wondering where shell stand tooeven the constellations were speechless üò≥holy shit this is so refreshingdokjas principles üò≤üò≤üò≤‚óã‚óã that was hotwow i think hes going to be an anti hero i love how he cut off that guys arms with  hesitation these peoples hypocrisy is just so real to me if ever this apocalypse happens the audacity to be guilt tripping someone to greed over their lives when that persons already trying to survive himself too  you have been gifted  coinsi just like how much he fking loves his new shield yes an mc that doesn‚Äôt stick to the morals ‚Äòhelp everyone‚Äô also they know what theyre doing with the cliffhangers lmaoaoaogive me your hard earned coins so i can survive i dont deserve to die did you kill another human being to get here um yes then screw off üëçüèªbrohe arms wentyeet üíÄthese people are the most unreliable if he helped them now then later they would probably betray him when the odds are against him dokja is seriously my number  character and development i agree damn well with his choices i would do the same its the apocalypse not a guy begging on the street i dont mean that rudely btwi love this because he just stick to surviving that‚Äôs all sure he may be doing some wrongs but also some right he is more balance if anything i dig dokja hes more in a grey area instead of being a goodytwoshoes a lot of protagonist with his powers and knowledge would use them too much and create more problems for themselves im glad a lot of webtoons seems to promote this kind of less predictable protagonistdokjas face expressions coupled with his black shirt was really    hot dokja is against communism dokja isnt a hero nor is he a villain hes a survivor doing whatever it takes to live and give the people he cares about the opportunity to survive without taking care of themyou know what i think he is making the right decision its there fault for being greedyüòí love the twist btwüíóafter reading this comic my eyes are still shining from excitement ü§© think about it those people are getting what they deservedokja is the most fair of all them it may seem a little too drastic but giving that people coins would be like giving thousands of money to murderers bc of the first scenario im so happy there is finally a character that dont care about what the others think that is fair and trust on their own point of viewdokjamy guyi simp for youi just wanted you to knowi definitely love dokja being a real one giving coins to everyone doesn‚Äôt help anybody what a masterpiece of a webtoon üò©the last panel was literal fire dokjas squad are preparing to destroy those idiotsthis webtoon is so much like the novel such a loyal recreation so fardokja nah frick you i have excaliburthey paid him fairly for food and get mad that he stole his money he just went and got food like any of them couldvethe constellation webtoon fangirl is very intrigued i‚Äôm curious to see how dokja‚Äôs party thinks of this them ppl thought dokja was pussy üòÇüòÇüòÇ the entitlement of all of them as if he had to help them because why to be a good person please they all sat around on their asses instead of trying to fend for themselves and expect him to give out his resources he earned for free byeee aint his fault since he didnt force you guys to buy the foodshit i love this webtoon i think im addicted to iti like dokjas thinking all those people literally killed other people to make it this far but now act like their the victims at the hands of his mercy if they were ready to kill other people for survival they are responsible for their own survival as well its also unlikely for them to survive anyway if they dont stop to rely on other people and they literally had the choice to either try finishing the scenario or die because of lack of coins the first might have even provided some coinshonestly what are they gonna do to him if he doesnt share in a matter of minutes theyll all be dead anyways soi love his character  its real  who would want to share his live freely with someone he didnt know survival of the fittest bitch you adapt or you die üò±üò±üò± me likey üòè and thats how this became my favorite webtooni love that do you have a death wish or something look at the end üëådokja doesnt have time for your bs dude here i am the person who read the novel patiently waiting to see kyrgioschaotic neutralwait until you see what he become in the futurewhat i find interesting is that these people who are themselves killers trying to hold dokja to a moral high ground like bishyup inho needs to see he ain‚Äôt the boss and the people need to see that inho has been mooching off of them parents with little kids children women have it rough in scenarios like these  but even dokja knows that he needs to cull thieving menaces to be of real help and that dude that got violated by a demon seems to not have learned his lesson either the point is that all the people in this scenario are murders they have killed someone to be in this scenario for them to be asking for coins as if it is the moral thing to do is ridiculous it depends on who actually deserves to be helped sangahs ability reminds me of the legend of theseus and the minotaurim glad the main character is basically saying fck you im tryna survive too aint no charity in these streets this is just life the rich people dont hand out money we work for our coinsi think his point is justifiable he straight up asked why do you deserve his coins prove it get them this is the apocalypse being friends wouldnt help you survive for long üòåto be honest dokja is the type of person who is alone but when it comes to lifethreatening situations he would do anything and help anyone if it benefits him as well the type of people dokja is helping are the type to giveandtake they are all compatible in there small group that dokja made they help each other out on the other hand inho cheon who dont give any fs and use other people i would also like to see inho cheon face when that man hands got cut of by dokjaalso dokja legit is getting food and this is what they do  the respect he might point out that the got who killed the monster has  coins and that the guy leading them didnt seem worried so he must have plenty of coins to sparedear santa please give me coins so i can read the next chapter i promise ill be good remember people to heart this chapter lets appreciate the characters uniqueness ‚ù§Ô∏èkillin old ladies one moment and begging for mercy the next naaaawwwww bruhs im good ah chaotic good i am familiar them give us our coins back  dokja ¬Ø\\_„ÉÑ_¬Ø survival of the fittest ¬Ø\\_„ÉÑ_¬Ødokja is looking out for his newly formed family notice how he was telling his new kid brother not to use his ability until he tells him to or how he lets the girl know not to tell anybody about her contract or how he got a shield for his buddy it seems to me hes looking out not just for himself but his friends oh and love the back and forth with the dokabilmao i just realized something coins are the most powerful thing in that world and this is the same for us people who have enough coins can fastpass while us peasants are left to die in boredom and impatience lewlthe moral high ground has no meaning when the first thing you had to do to survive was take another lifehe just had enough of your shitthank you for the realism when your life‚Äôs at stake there‚Äôs no time for a moral high ground‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èhelp me i have a serious thing for dokjai feel like you could never stick to a moral high ground in an apocalyptic universe people are gonna die and you want to survive what you have to do to survive may not he the most morally good thing to do but thats lifei like dokja‚Äôs way of thinking it‚Äôs not the typical ‚Äúhero‚Äù personality that he‚Äôs got but at least he thinks rationally depending on the situation they are in stan dokja üõêdid they think theyd survive if it werent for dokja giving them the food what do they think is dokja to them their nanny ofc hes gonna ask you to pay for shit nothing is free in this world nothing i really do love dokjas character to death hes not the usual annoyingly good guy mc and even the protagonist of the story isnt nice theyre human and it shows i love how much this webtoon shows the flaws of us living beings i also would do the same thing hes smart cunning and selfish plus he tells it how it is like why should i give up my coins for yall when that has nothing to do with me he reminds me of myself and i love iti think dokja is a good person he does help people when he can like heewon but theres a line between nice and stupidty he cant just sacrifice himself for everyone else in such an insane world it really forces your true self out of you i like how this mc isnt just gonna blindly follow we must help others sharing is caring~ like many other mcs do another example of an mc i think is similar to dokja in the above stated manner is medea from your throne dokja sure is one hell of an interesting character huhi love how realistic kind of dokja is i mean his personalitydokja had to risk his life in many situations in order to earn that many coins it‚Äôs his right to keep those coins to himself instead of giving it to people that sat around in a safe zone waiting for coins and food while others went out and risked their lives for coins and food ü§∑okay but seriously how many of them killed to survive the first round only thise who didnt deserve it and honestly survival of the fittest and his friends he and his crew went out and earned those coins they didnt kill a single person eitheridk why people think the protag is evil in the first game he saved the child when he had no reason to and he also saved the woman from the poison when yet again he had no reason to it just so happens that they were useful the child was not in the webtoon that he was reading and the woman was but he had no idea who she wasim just waiting for the constellation secretive plotter to reveal that heshe is the author of twsano shits were givenbro what abt the suit guy he has like  coinsthe ad i got at the end of this episode just so happened to be a snickers adself defence moral high ground they took lives why should he save theirs i dunno still pretty high morals and he attacked only when his life was in danger ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it‚Äôs not all so black and whitedealing with people is exhausting irl and even in apocalypseare we just gonna ignore hyeongseong lee being adorable after polishing his shieldright if you need coins get them for yourself dokja literally fights everytime while the others just wait for food and coins its an apocalypse i dont like it morally but i do agree with him since he did earn the coins and this is life or death he cant rlly be charitable in this kind of situation yep im addicted ddokja was like nah this an apocalypse not a charity üò®üò®üò® dokja sometimes is really scary i want a refund huh lol ok karen i want a refund when you ask for a refund you gotta bring back what you bought no then give the food back oh you cant not his problemdude theres literally a survival fee for everyday say dojka gave away all these coins for the people ok and then what he cant do this everyday so theyre going to die anyway like bruh hes not even being evil i played way too much etrian odyssey to not recognize an ariadne thread when i see one üòÇooh what a powerful boy we got therei love grey charactersthat army guy is so cute when he wipe that shield üòÜüòÜüòÜskfjfjsjfjj why am i so into the whole morally grey mc trope üò© especially when they got that  iq üëåü§å like medea muah chefs kissthings have gotten so interesting i misread have you all been well and saw it have you all been in hellluke skywalker would be proud i love me some psychological warfarethis is survival anything goes if only you hadnt bought excessively then none of this wouldve happened he may look like hes making heartless decisions but its simply survivallol our favorite doakabi is backi mean even if he went full on humanitarian and gave away every single scrap he still couldn‚Äôt save everyone in rescue training they teach you never to put yourself in a position of unnecessary risk bc you‚Äôll just increase the number of people needing rescuedsame idea here some degree of selfishness required im satisfied with dokjas decisionmorally grey characters are my weaknesswhy isnt anyone talking about bihyeong he was hilarious and adorable that wink and that totally innocent whistlingso chaotic neutral character niceother readers i love this doods attitude me yay bihyeongs backa character with common sense and isnt an asshole im hooked now dokja is so badass im here for itbruh the kid in the back is lookin just as evil as dokja he like mfer deserved it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èim kind of happy  a little sad that some kids will die but these people cant seem to understand that this world now revolves in a different way  and dokja will ride the wavesim glad that dokja didnt give infck that dumb face inho i wannaüòíüëä himi love how this dude really keeps targeting dokjahe doesnt even help them out himself just using their misfortune to manipulate them no more kind dokjai like how dokja has gone from ‚Äúi am a normal person‚Äù to ‚Äúi am a super genius‚Äù to ‚Äúwhy should i give a shit if you live or die‚Äù over the course of ~ chaptersin a situation where you dont need morals to survive i like that attitudehehhes so hot god i need a minutethe look in his eye is crazy and i love itcheckmate communists yesyesyes yes kill them alli love it when the mc turns evilooo goddamn dokja is becoming a morally grey character someone who isn‚Äôt good but not baddokja is my new religion üßé‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èhonestly i get it why sacrifice for people who leech off of you and kill you the first chance they get the best thing to do while they still had plenty time wouldve been to try to fulfil the scenario with the strongest leading the charge or with inho inspiring the others but unfortunately those in charge are selfish cowards im glad he chooses to be selfish cause for what reason he wanna give them the coins in this time you should save yourself first before save other people yay the little crazy creature is bk and l love dokia face is like a crazy person laughing to himselfthis webtoon is awesome  the main character is very progressive and hyper aware of the situation i love it hey uh dokja got cake all these people survived by murdering someone if anything they shouldn‚Äôt even talk about sharing and having morals i think dokja‚Äôs decisions are right i think morally he is doing the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing to survive what about what‚Äôs his face that received  coins for finishing off the demon couldn‚Äôt he sharei love how dokja thinks fck morals be smart this is why i love antihero main characters am i the only one who laughed when the guy looked back at his falling armsüëÄ it was funny to me im not sadistic tho lolif this was real life than id probably have to think about my personal morals and the situation a bit before siding with dokja but since this is fiction im satisfied as hell with whats happening right now go dokja dugh man i read it to fast now i have to waitüòÖüò¢ooooooh yes i love dokja hes one of the best characters ive seen in webtoon so fareveryones gonna forget that  coins that evil rich dude got for slaying the monsterwould have been funny if he said that the annoying ex workmate had just won  coins just wondering what would have happened then p holy fudge this is the mc that ive been looking forthis has nothing to do with the webtoon but long live the demon kinghe‚Äôs not rude he‚Äôs just being smart all these ppl would never give him if they hadperiod they would never and we all know that so ya why would he dokja is the one character whos neither too kind and good to be true neither evil and ruthless hes smart and wise its so refreshing to see such a character and well ofc hes climbing up the d best list too quicklyomg make this an animeawooooga bark bark grrrrryesss love a good chaotic neutral character i wonder what the backstory of that kid did since the first scenario is to kill an organism i wonder if he killed a person or something else the kid as in one of the woman‚Äôs kidi love it when my main characters go chaotic neutraldid anyone notice huwons traits is about to blossom hope she doesn‚Äôt become a mass murder like dokja said she mightplease make this an animei like how the authors made clear dokja its not a piece of cake by making him cut both arms of the thug at once no joking aroundi love this i cant even writehe went from zero to badass in  secondsill call it as a realistic smart and pratical good character dokja is the epitome of true neutral im really curious to see how his friends are going to react for him doing that in a survival speaking it was a really good choice if your point in that time is to survive then morals and feelings are useless however in a human way of seeing this situation no matter what you tell yourself there is this feeling of morality that tells you what he did was wrong to those persons who are just trying to live and you shouldnt be with him so it becomes a huge psychological conflictdokjas perfect retaliation this is why its one of the top webtoonsthey all asked so nicely for the coins and food before but when hes finally being a little selfish because there his coins they all just try to kill him like dude he gave away all of his food and risked his life to find more and this is what they resort to loloriginal sin i think it refers to the  deadly sin pride  inho the b@st@rd lust  the guys that tryna rape girls by luring them back in the early ep greed  them hovering over dokjas food and money sloth  them be just sittin there waiting for food wrath  inho and the people attacking dokja envy  cursed dude envying dokja for its achievements gluttony  idkyeah this decision seems logical to me ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏ènew world  new rules  even on normal world there is no good people and evil people  there is survival your mind own sense od justicethis webtoon is a war between my ‚Äúwork together to survive‚Äù mentality vs my ‚Äúgive no shits cause they don‚Äôt deserve it‚Äù mentality it‚Äôs getting so fucking goodour coins what i find funny is how they all say they want a refund but they already ate all the fooddokja really said f in the chat to the people who cant pay for it üëÅüëÑüëÅi want dojak to turn the tables besides none of this fee stuff would have happened if greedie boy over there didnt stockpile foodlove when main characters go semi dark in these situationsi really shouldn‚Äôt be laughing this hard üòÇ dokja really is the definition of true neutraldojka in the last panel left me with shivers down my spinei would have turned it around i would have said okay but only if you and your group redistribute your own coins first lets see your status screen and the other search party members and have you pay off as much as possible then i can pay the remainder that should be fair since i havent officially joined this group yet and have been attacked twice already dont  delay too long of you want everyone to surviveim eagerly waiting for the next episode dokja is not a hero known for his heart of gold and his bravery hes just another player with a distinct advantage he has intricate knowledge of the game world and he has to use that knowledge wisely im sure he doesnt want people to die but theres no point in killing himself for them so early in the game he might give them a chance if he deems them worthy of joining his party but thats about it dokja is so freaking cool because he is not one of those goodygoody always do whats right and angelic and kind at your own expense kind of character but he is not just a straight up kill everyone and make explosions for no reason but to cause suffering kind of character either it is so amazing and i love itit was the people decision to buy the food in the first place then they crazy cause they don‚Äôt have the coins to survive anymore tough luck man ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èi think dokja is chaotic neutralhe did the right decision i would of done the same or just not returnyou see those mental gymnastics right there first they blame dokja for all their problems then they expect him to fix their problems and then expect him to just sit their and let them jump him hilarious hahaha the fine line between morality vs justice it may not be morally right to not help those people but they put themselves in that position so it would be unjust to dokja if he were to selflessly sacrifice what he had earned himself it‚Äôs all oh so sweet gotta love dokja my man üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºit isnt morality its justice what have they done to deserve the coins its just stupid the next time they need to pay the fee they wont have any coins because there aren t helping nor going out for supplies btw black shorted hair girl is waifu uwui was getting tired of him playing along for the love of god its the fcking apocalypsei really like this character development unlike other main characters this make apocalypses more realistic i hope dokja knock some sense into those people against inho or even themselves they let themselves get into a position where inhos group has power over them it may not be the best decision for dokja but it may have been a wise oneyes finally an mc in dealing with these kind of scenarios the way i want them too no more playing the hero and saving people who dont need to be saved or will just flip on you at the drop of a dime my god the adrenaline kick from this episode love it  anyway i really hope this gang stays as allies üòåüòåhm so dokja is a gray characteri üëèüèΩ dont üëèüèΩhave üëèüèΩmoney üëèüèΩ so üëèüèΩ ill üëèüèΩ wait üëèüèΩ lmao üò≠ this webtoon is a dopethose peopleare so stupid really he worked hard for it and its not his fault that they didnt get to eat bc it got confiscated and also they didnt huntthey cant just stick or think someone will do things for them to survivethen they have the audacity to ask for coins when all they do is complain best mc everof course those people deserve coins but if they‚Äôre all clamoring and running up towards him violently he can‚Äôt give them to anyone since he doesn‚Äôt even have enough coins in addition they are only thinking of themselves when doing this trying to attack him saying that he needs to give them coins because they need them more than him because it‚Äôs evil to do otherwise they act out of selfishness so why can‚Äôt dokja act out of selfishness too this is the apocalypse i badly want an animation of this webtoon i know it will and i cant for itü§ßü§ßdokja is right all of these people killed someone else to clear the first scenario now why they are asking him for help thats not how you survive fellas you go dokja as long as he is not betraying anyone he is finebihyeong in the background looking adorable and secretly chatting with dokja is precious best thing ever bihyeong is my fave even though hes a cosmic being that basically runs a torture channel ruining lives and hes not actually like a good guy i guess but whatevs he fictional and sometimes lovelyi think he just wants to see who attacks him and help out the restthe satisfaction when undeserving people dont get what they want üò≥personal attribute of a badassits nice to have a main character who thinks rationally and makes the right decision i love reading his thoughts because they analyze the situations clearly if they cant take care of their own lives what right did they have to take others anyways even if he gave them coins today they will ask for more tomorrowthis is basically equity vs equality should we all receive the same or should we all achieve the same levelyes thats exactly what i wanted to see this webtoon just climbed up the ranks of my top  with a gigantic leapeveryone who is saying dokja is gonna be a bad character kind of person i will say these are his survival tactics if he just agrees to everything other people say then whats the profit in reading twsa he needs to be one of the protagonist that i feelit feels to me like dokja is going to walk a weird sort of moral grey area and apply pressure on both sides to survive i like thisok but suit man has like k coins someone let them knowwhy does he let blond main group leader live he kills for lessthis is totally interesting survival story where moral ground is in conflict with survival of the charactersfinally tbh i would of been done killed someone bro like fr idc let me be the villain that is full and is rich off coins i earned my fair share should of read the book sucks to suck tell on the so called leader that bastardit would have been seriously idiotic if dokja had chosen otherwise usually all the protagonists try to be heroic and hold on to their morals and stuff with the stupid self sacrificing personality but dokja is straightforward legendary and his face in that panel why should i give you any was so badass it‚Äôs nice to have heroes that act selfish once in a while it‚Äôs quite refreshing to see the people‚Äôs faces like ‚Äúwhat but we wasted our money on your food refund‚Äù i‚Äôm like ‚Äúbruh if you can‚Äôt return the food in one edible piece why should he give back the coins‚Äùyou dont care about him so why would he care about you üòíohohohohohoits not censoreddokja keeps showing traits of maybe why his destiny chose him to hold more power in the times of apocalypse people deserve love mercy and sharing to prosper together but dokja also knows how to find the true deserving ones when you go to attack someone you should expect them to fight back he has more coins than all of you for a reasonnow this is what a protagonist should bewell frick why does dokja have to be so hot and cool help me pls somebodyyou don‚Äôt need to set yourself on fire to keep other people warm greedy people just take and take there‚Äôs no end to it one day it‚Äôs this another it‚Äôs that i‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs not giving in it‚Äôs rare to see a main character not maintain morals this series is so original and well written and honestly i hope it gets its own animeme who needs  coins to feed the next episodewhen u try to roleplay a true neutral pc on dungeons and dragonsfinally a main character who isn‚Äôt always niceoh i like him more and more why should dokja share his coins if they didnt even earn them everyone literally wants everything for free and its patheticyess a protagonist makes a practical decision he looks dead on the insidehe literally disarmed that guythis was a ratherdisarming episodethread and labyrinth huh i think her sponsor is a greek mythdokja yesss you will not be fooled by that evil manokay but why is the dokkaebi so cutethis webtoon is so amazing i do not regret fast passing lee hyeonseong lee hyunsung whatever spelling your name is lmao you precious bean i wanna protect you with my life i wanna wrap you in a blanket and sing you lullabies this webtoon always makes me coins spendin and im not regretting it aaaaahhh this nigga rawdokja gives a lesson stand up for urself u always gonna be kind to everyone then u gonna get urself killed limit ur kindness ^_^the fact that i have to wait is killing me but this is now my new favorite series fast pass isnt fast enough if you reached the last available episode üòêi like how dokja is a true neutral character not a protagonist but also not a villain he doesn‚Äôt hurt or help anybody he doesn‚Äôt have to with exceptions lol  and i am excited to see where his character development goes from here finally i feel bad for the guy who got his arm cut off but damn that is one effective way to settle a crowd and get them to listen real quick even if only for a minute it could make all the difference is this man just going to straight up murder the leader damn i hope sovote dokja for most savage man of not even  someone just spare me  more coins i promise ill pay you back just  more to make it to the next scenariowelp now i‚Äôm officially going bankrupt thank you webtoonssharin ain‚Äôt carin in  üò∑excited to see a well written anti hero these are so hard to cone by these daysi see dokja being a grey area character not necessarily evil but not good either hes just true neutral people kill the man who survived the subway dokja deletes a mans arms please do continue to try if you want to diethat‚Äôs insane he‚Äôs giving out coins in trade for handsi love dokjathis is not a handy situation its all out of hand and in the palm of chaos but this story is finger licking goodcame to comment on how much i like having a neutral main character but so did everyone else üòÇoh boy he‚Äôs not playing around anymorewhy cant they release two chapters a day they got me fcked up having to wait üëÄüò°üò° also i love homegirl that asked for the sword lol  bish has no chill and i love it  she is def gun be a bad ass character ‚úäüèΩüëäüèΩüí¢thatll be me when i stop acting nice to everyone and smilingdokja is right why would he give his coins for them if he gave his coins they will just be thankful at first but the system will collect coins and the cycle will repeat again its % waste he dont even know or owe them theyre parasites and you wouldnt want parasites stick on you and extract all you have until you have nonei‚Äôm not gonna put dokja on a pedestal for cutting the guy‚Äôs forearms off but i will say this is getting pretty interesting slayyy dokja as you shouldhe always think logically i love his characterim so addicted to this webtoonwhat high morality and shit dokja collected all those coins himself he risked his life to get the foods too if anything its those leechesthat went from please give us some of your coins~ to kill him and get his coins from him real quickdokja is just keeping it  if they wanted to live they couldve gone out and put the work in instead following a prick who just talks all the damn time dokja earned his coins he owes nothingwhy do they want a refund i mean they bought it and ate itüíÄi mean think about it what would happen in the long run its just like that saying you can give a man a fish but you can teach how to fish and hell fish for the rest of his life its not exactly like that but in the future they wont have enough coins either and he cant just keep giving them coins that will get him killedyk i love it when characters drop the good deeds and decide that they dont wanna deal with any of the bs hes also got a point as well and yeah majority of the people were asses anyway who killed to survive in the first scenario but now theyre all going up to dokja and beg him for coins and shit im excited to see where this is going and him slicing the dudes arms man ive never been so satisfiedreally love dokja so much sick and tired of mcs who are like ‚Äúohhh yeah i‚Äôm a good guy lets share some shit‚Äù he is like nah bitches not happening lmaodokja believes in justice so hes right to ask why if u have bad intentions why should he helphes so hotthis is why i love dokja ü§£‚ù§Ô∏èif its not just me but why do i feel like dokja is not normal either‚Ä¶ from the start where he instantly knew how to use his bookmark and hi calm demeanor while facing people deaths its not normal it feels like he knows something but i couldn‚Äôt explainoh yey ~ theres a difference to logic and morality thats why philosophers always grind their brains with ethics coz they have different values and principles with survival as the main objective being charitable kills even the recipients not just the giverbihyung is back lol but he looks so cuteeven im scared and pleased to his decision its just so good that the author makes the plot twist excitingdokjas decision was realistic idk the right term for that bcs i mean they are all fighting for survival being righteous and kind would actually bring them nowhere or something like that dang i should work on my vocabularyomg im so in love with his attitudethat last panel chillsmc so bad assthis is refreshinghyeongseong is a big softiehahah i like how his arms got chopped off they are saying that he is a bad guy but all of the survivors are  bad people for what they have done so they shouldnt even say a person is bad because their is no good peopledokja lookin hot there wtfam i the only one who missed the dokkaebi and thinks its cuteno just me okayüòëok damn that was hothes kinda like a prantagonisti would have just murdered anyone who tried to take the coins no moral high ground in this universe screw you inhothey want to get coins easier than accomplishing the scenariosthe best way to describe dokja is dark heror thought their methods are cruel they always do whats justicethis is exactly what i expected him to do in the previous episode people should learn not to blame others for their errors eren likethis is actually a depiction of the sad reality people will blame you for their own misfortune they will ask you things and if you wont give it to them they will blame you for the things they couldnt attain bc of the loss of that something when in fact they couldve made a way to get that something dokja is so hot grrrrrokay look if he gave them coins just for free like he‚Äôs not getting anything in return free he‚Äôs giving them a free pass they will end up just sitting there with their hands outreached waiting for you to put the next thing in their palm they have to earn it even now you have to work for everything so like they‚Äôre not just gonna be given a free pass even the child was like ‚Äúim not gonna be useless‚Äù and got skills to help and actually helped that‚Äôs not a lack of morals or empathy disarming a grunt with ] has taken and is impressed with the hard decision] i wonder if he could have gained any traction by mentioning the incite ability people hate being manipulated once they know then again that would probably be showing his hand too muchantiheroduhyeah like they killed another person to save themselves and now they want him to save them without any profitwhy should heüòèwhat about the dude with over  coins did he diemama got a point though it‚Äôs not his fault you‚Äôre there ü§îokay but why did he seemed so hot like i can‚Äôt handle one more fictional crushthings are about to get interesting uhonestly they don‚Äôt have any right to make others stick to morality if they themselves have thrown theirs away also that inciteful fellow is annoying too and i‚Äôm excited to see the tables turndamn i just started reading this for just coins but its so addicting lolhe is starting to get the dripi just want someone to look at me like the tank is looking at his shield maybe its just me trying to justify it but i think when he said something to the effect of they all took a life but couldnt take responsibility for their own he knew most of these people didnt even look for an alternative theyre people who wouldnt help him were their positions reversed not after consideration consciously just out of pure cowardice the way people make excuses not to help others every day when theyre easily in a position todokkaebi communication you mean when you and your friend are in the same room texting each otherre reading this was worth it ahhhhh my cute bihyeong is backkküò≠‚ô•Ô∏èto be fair he never has stuck to a moral high ground not in the slightest he has been doing everything as if he wasn‚Äôt actually in the situation himself he is doing everything in order to make the constellations want to pay attention to him fulfilling his end of his contractcame here to get free coins and got a nice webtoon to read winwin situation at its bestüåüthis hole coin situation is kinda funny when i realize im reading this for free coins in the app these idiots they were the ones who were going to steal food from dokja and now their mad because he gave it to themdude dokja tho üî•üî•üî•üî• get em for some reason my brain sometimes automatically reads dokja as doja cat thank u he same situation happened to me obviously not as dangerous but still i was playing and online game and i traded stuff for a rare item and the next day the girl wanted it back i was like no it was a fair trade if u wanted to keep ur items then dont trade theminteresting a john henry fabre reference i highly recommend his book on entomological science the insect world its such a fun book üòùaye why is that mf mr han  siding with the other guy after all that hardship dokja went through to save him üòídamn hes so badass üò©give me some dokkaebi plushie pleasegilyeong lools like the child of dojka and the brown haired woman that has the same colored has as gilyeong sorry if im spwlling it wrongooooohhhhhh im excited to see where this goes love the change of his mood humans are so pathetic  just blaming someone else always  he giving off that bad bitch energy i love this story so damm much ughthat last pannel scares the hell outta medokja is about to be the ultimate grey area lolllfkki like this side mci think dokja is doing the right thing if you want to survive an apocalypse you don‚Äôt really try to protect everyone around you this isn‚Äôt a game it‚Äôs life survival of the fittest my dudesfrankly when trying to survive you can only look after yourself and your loved ones in good times or bad you can share what you can but if i had myself to look after i would be the same and im a really giving person you gotta be smart and dokja isso glad the mc isn‚Äôt a generic trash that tries to have a moral high groundi fucking love dokja hes one of the best mc out there he sees no need in having a high moral ground its a damn apocalypsei literally love this character its ok to be badüòài like how both dokja and the station ppl are to blame for their situation right now the reason theyve run out of coins is bc they gave it to dokja and now everyone is pointing fingers at him its a kindness of dokja to even think of sharing his food to them this webtoon is just amazing cant wait to read more‡≤†–¥‡≤†Ôªøyeeeeeaaaaahhhhhhhhh lets goi meani would‚Äôve done the sameüò∂like dude you ain‚Äôt gonna remember me tomorrow for what i do today when you were already up with a rod to kill me nowü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èive decided since im a six foot six giant in real life my constellation will be named giant of moralityi‚Äôm enjoying the fact dokja isn‚Äôt falling for that guys manipulative ways so muchhhhhhh a little too much if i may addwhy didnt the mc just say that the glasses guy has more coins than him like glasses guy literally has kyes pop off on em dokjadojka is a good character its the others who are bad and i see alot of people saying dojka is being bad and its cool yes hes not helping others whore not even trying he did help them earlier by giving them food for a cost money is a convenient tool for people and theyve just relied on it anyways like he said the first scenario was themed on original sin so it makes sense for everyone else to be sinfulsome people here really makes me wanna slap my phonevery interesting strokes nonexistent beardi think were entering the corruption arc ü§îi love the mc so much holy shti‚Äôm glad he isn‚Äôt sticking to the moral high ground because i‚Äôm sure that guy that‚Äôs using incite would just use dokja until he was completely worn down it‚Äôs probably why the other protagonist left the subway immediately as well if he gives k coins today then he‚Äôd have to give money again tomorrow and the next day because this group is just sitting arounddamn mc badass level skyrocketed from  to a freaking  but thats kinda cruel honestly i dont know what id do in this situation üòÖüòÖüòÖokay cause dokja was definitely justified in doing that all of these people have no problem turning on him if they had the opportunity so don‚Äôt bring this moral crap on him nothing is free you need to work for these things so accept your fate or try to change and earn those damn coinsi really like the original sin dynamic herenow heres a character i can relate to honestly im sick of characters who always stick to the white side in a gray world theres no black and white really love dokjasht just went from  to  real quickdamn the kids power is strong never expected him to be able to connect to a monster that size early on i really like this development most mcs are just annoying talking about good and bad actually its all greyüêß cant wait until dokja thrown a stone at zeus i will have to wait  years to see thathyeonsong is the cutest baby big boy im glad hes not all self righteous and shitlet‚Äôs goooo dokja supremacy dokja won‚Äôt suck up to hypocrites this is the kind of mc i want cause in his world no one is fug releated to you they just leave you alone when you need them üòàüòàüòàbihyeong being cute hahahaha you little wicked patootiey‚Äôall i bet secret plotter is the guy who wrote the book he read i‚Äôm glad he isn‚Äôt sticking to the moral high ground because i‚Äôm sure that guy that‚Äôs using incite would just use dokja until he was completely worn down it‚Äôs probably why the other protagonist left the subway immediately as well if he gives k coins today then he‚Äôd have to give money again tomorrow and the next day because this group is just sitting arounddamn mc badass level skyrocketed from  to a freaking  but thats kinda cruel honestly i dont know what id do in this situation üòÖüòÖüòÖokay cause dokja was definitely justified in doing that all of these people have no problem turning on him if they had the opportunity so don‚Äôt bring this moral crap on him nothing is free you need to work for these things so accept your fate or try to change and earn those damn coinsi really like the original sin dynamic herenow heres a character i can relate to honestly im sick of characters who always stick to the white side in a gray world theres no black and white really love dokjasht just went from  to  real quickdamn the kids power is strong never expected him to be able to connect to a monster that size early on i really like this development most mcs are just annoying talking about good and bad actually its all greyüêß cant wait until dokja thrown a stone at zeus i will have to wait  years to see thathyeonsong is the cutest baby big boy im glad hes not all self righteous and shitlet‚Äôs goooo dokja supremacy dokja won‚Äôt suck up to hypocrites this is the kind of mc i want cause in his world no one is fug releated to you they just leave you alone when you need them üòàüòàüòàbihyeong being cute hahahaha you little wicked patootiey‚Äôall i bet secret plotter is the guy who wrote the book he read yeah when im in an apocalyptic world i hope i find someone like him and end up in their party lmao why didnt he say that out loud you know that part where he said that they took someone else‚Äôs life and cant take care of their own like thats factsü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èwho else hopes this will be adapted into an anime in the near futureim crying from pure fucking happiness i cant belive how good this is bringing back memories from when i read the novelllll t^tguys remember to like the chapterim laughing cause the regular main characters be like we need to uphold the moral standpoint and share while dokja just be like pay up btches~ i dont fcking care if you die only me and my friends can survive for almost free~ like oh my god~ xd he is like an anti hero or like one of those people you think are more logical than moralsome villains but are actually the main characteraka drstone you have been gifted  coins aaaaa hes so hoti am really really happy for dokja he turned it out amazingly i am waiting for the next episodeüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäfck yesdokja woke up and chose violence and i love itbro that sword is so coolthis is is just too good ive spent my night reading thisüò≠don‚Äôt these people know it was their choice to buy food from him you can‚Äôt get your money back with out giving the product back dummiesgoooo dokja he doesnt owe them anything when they treated him so badly dokja kinda looking like a psycho at the end there and i kinda i like itthe secret is that the coins they use is the coins us readers use to buy fast passesüòâdammmmnnnn dokja you rulei agree with dokjas logic why should someone that killed someone else to save themselves get coins from him for free what makes them so deserving of the coins also the food he had hed gathered for himself and was even willing to sell it to them they were not obligated to buy it nor was it his fault when it disappearedhonestly i would do the same in this situation being pushed around by the incite ability can only go as far as you let itdokja just killed a strong monsterwhat are these puny humans gonna do to him lol gtfohes simply just thinking about his own future theres nothing wrong with that people already do it in this world but are more corrupt about it damn manz tryna live dudei thought he would tell them that the glasses clown has  coins but this might be better since even if all of these people manage to get past this round theyre guaranteed to die on the next round anyways lolfinally a character not scared of anything take their arms off kingwhy should you share you grabbing other people shit without asking to borrow it this guy is a smart dudeyou know what this is kim dokja  the best mc ever and for novel readers did dokja acted like this in the novel i dont remember clearly but i think he was not that angry i really really want this to get turned into an animei got where hes coming from if he gives those ppl the coins thats equivalent to giving all the clothes off your back in the dead of winter and you die and they still in trouble it benefits for a sec but it didnt truly help i kind of like the route his character is taking a lawfully good character would have been supremely irritating because they would continuously sacrifice themselves without thinking of the personal repercussions just like an avg person hes neutral preservingoh my god im loving this so so much and its getting better every single episodemental note dont ask dokja for anything or i might lose my handshe risked his life to get those coins and what did y‚Äôall do just sit around in the station expecting someone else to do the work for youdokja has hit his point i like this character so awesome i like itthese comments literally sound like constellation commentary lol but dokja really is an interesting character because he has a lot to deal with pleasing the constellations trying to stay alive while also helping others it‚Äôs really unfair because he has worked really hard for his coins while other people do nothing and just expect the coins to be handed to them gosh this whole comic is amazing ‚ú®king‚ú® periodtwell that was hot nosebleeds you see nothingif dokja decide to side with that high moral to help those people he will defintely get trapped in cheon inho plan just like if you being kind to the people for one time they will ask you another kindness thats how human do even in the our world and inho want that for his own selfishness and so he can using and  controling dokja thats why what dokja do here is right that last panel tho üëåüèªyaaass im so satisfied with his decision not everyone deserves your own kindness just gotta show em what u r truly capable of which enough to dread others and back offlegit wanna hear dokjas voice and the action asfkjfdlüò≥ if this turn out to be an anime üôä theres no word can express my mind see this is why i couldn‚Äôt survive in an apocalypse i‚Äôm too nice the lawful neutral best clift hanger everthis is definitely going to be an anime the way this story is progressing and the twist and turns they‚Äôve made so far and it‚Äôs only been  chapters yes yes yes i love this scene what comes after is so great honestly so satisfyingbiyungs reactions on the indirect messages is so kawaii he is a antiheromy man went from midoriya to kirito real quick really thinking about buying the fast pass now this is hype afi think i would make the same decision considering the coinsi would ask and i would make decisionsya know what would be really awesome if dokja just killed the leader and took his coins im really liking this series thanks for your hard workdokja has impressed me by showing how smart and calm he iswhat those fools should of known is that everyone has a breaking point and his just got destroyedim glad that dokja isnt gonna put up with this pricks bull anymore it makes me happy to see hes not in a gaming moodremembers how people usually ask for scope the day before an exam and the aducity to ask for stationery the hour before exam me why should ibest character ever‚ú®the apocalypse blame gamefinally the snowball plushy mini demon is back not that other bratthe constellation  is very impressed with your performance she decides to gift you  she also says thank you for replinishing her sanitydokjas squad shouldnt return back to the camp they can just survive on their owndaaanggg someone cover the kid‚Äôs ears this is about it get even uglierafter reading the webnovel i can‚Äôt begin to tell you how happy i am with this seeing it in picture is one thing now we just need a studio to bring it to lifedokja be likei dont give a fucki love how he doesn‚Äôt care if i were him i‚Äôd do the same cause why should you care when these ppl are all selfish bustardsdamn how i hate these people in storys who only blame others like that wont help or solve the problem mc has no friggin bussines giving them free coins and then die himself like bruhi did think he would pull out his sword but i did not expect him to cut off the dudes hands jsjsjjsjsjsi feel like the mc is going to become more of an anti hero you know kinda like deadpool but a little more sanedoes anyone know how their names are pronounced especially gilyeongme being a huge fan of rpg‚Äôs i‚Äôm really interested to see how our little group of characters changes not only emotionally but their skills and items tooi % agree with my mans over here  billion iqhmmmm i‚Äôd say he‚Äôs a lawful neutral still does good things and follows the law but like he‚Äôs really only in it for himself and maybe a few others if he cares about them enough although that‚Äôs probably not that likelyok but dokja that was kinda hot ngl üôàwhat about the business man he got like  million or thousand coins from the curse thing didn‚Äôt hei love dokja even morebadassi was so interested in this webtoon that after reading the last episode i went ahead and read the webnovel lolwhy the hell he needs to share this is apocalypse he gained his coins slaughtering demons he doesnt need to share it with some man only sitting in the corner safely i would do the same with one exception i would spare kids pov you dont remember the actual main characters name they may think he was acting villain but no hes just being logical and i like itdont worry bro you can open your character status in like  chapters i‚Äôm so glad dokja didn‚Äôt do what other people would deem the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing those people are hypocrites especially that whatshisface he should die firsthuh come on even the lil kid is using his survival skills its high time these people understand dokja way to go boy man i really dislike inho cheon i think dokja is doing the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing we‚Äôll see exactly what he plans next chapter he didn‚Äôt take those coins from anyone they willingly paid because they wanted the food he originally collected himself and he brings up a good point that all these people who are alive now most likely killed someone in the first scenario to survive i can‚Äôt wait to see how the characters develop especially huiwon also can‚Äôt wait to see what fate belongs to inhowho would give out coins to help killers survive like who the hell they think they area lot of top comments are saying everyone there had to kill in the first scenario but like there are clearly young children & older people present maybe they got lucky and had a different scenario bc i dont remember dokja or dokkaebbi saying the first quest was the same for all users but also even if it was the same maybe some of them had similar solutions to dokja in that scenario and the comments are saying its pragmatic to let all those people die i disagree thats eugenics i need coins too üòú to read any furtherlolall this time i thought the dokaebbi eyes were just hollow sockets when in reality he‚Äôs got these cutesy bubble eyes üò≠damn he really said bye bye to that guys arms i like how different dojka thinks im quite interested to see what he does next i cant deny it that guy was good at manipulating people at the right time he knows when to use his powerful enchanting words that was a nice battoujutsu i like this episodeomg i think i have a crushdokja  hello my name is dokja and im chaotic neutral nice to meet youdokja thats dark i like it hehehethe color of his words are as ice cold as he is ryt now lolread the web novel guys it is srsly amazing and you will not regret it i couldnt wait for more of the webtoon so i started the novel and i have been reading it non stop for the past three days coz its so good i keep trying to recommend it but it feels just like when dokja tried to recommend twsa and no one listened to him  yk this is a very interesting turn of events üëÄaaaand now we have a psychopath as the thumbnail for a week being kind is good  but being a pushover isnt all those ppl would die anyway because they are bad players so dojka would only kill himself for nothing he made the correct decision when the world gets bad enough the good go crazy but the smart they go bad he just stated clearly no to socialism just dokja being  dokja at this moment they should know they fcked upthey do realize they are trying to say they deserve coins and then attempt to murder their only chance at survival plus they dont even know killing him will give them back their coinsi need coins tooooo yasss dokja slayss ‚ú®‚ú®that villain is dangerous and cunning he turns everything against you including your actions and wordsgenius kill someone then take your coins back by having to touch fingers where the person transferring coins has to think absolutely brillianti would rather be a villain who does good sometimes than be a heroyass i had to same he very logical character and puts himself first mf went sicko mode üíÄim not even halfway through this webtoon but i just know this is going to be one of my favouritesif u want your coins back give the food back or did u eat it alreadyconstellation broke reader is satisfied with the amount of head rubs dokja is giving gilyeongcrissy wake up i dont like this üòÄright decision dude dokja is not your typical saviour protagonist lolall i could say is slaydokja i love you very much dasurrrvv ahabshsjjdhssudokjas character ‚ú®ü§åüèªhe kind of look like sung jin wooi‚Äôm liking dokja he‚Äôs being smart and realistic in this situation yesssssss i like the kind but logical mc hes kind but hes a human he must be kind to himself and the people he care first before random people who just want to leech ‚ù§hes right he risked his life for those coins and he better not give them to people who just sat there and complained as said before age or gender doesnt matter here u can just upgrade ur stats instead of complaining abt not wanting to diedokja is karma incarnate you reap what you sowthat was a wise decision dokja üëèi am very sick because of the development of the dokja character üôÉ it making the situation more interesting day by day ü§†he‚Äôs being realistic i mean these people are murderers and can‚Äôt even pay for the sin the committed dokja went out of his way and earned these coins so why should he give them he would just make lose and what would these people give him backin return nothing he‚Äôs not all goodie it‚Äôs an apocalypse a fucking apocalypse crazy people üíÄ he wants to survive everyone wants to survive you should be held responsible for you own live they are all moral incorrect inc dokja protag who doesnt care about moral high ground woof woof woof üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èothers give me back my coins     dokja suck my ass the absolute irony of making the beginning villain a literal edgelord just to pull the same garbage with your main charactereven if he did give them coins they would be monkeys and stay in the station and die the next day anyway _ bruhanyone  sharing is caring dokja  i dont get paid enough to carethats right show them what kind of people would be like in the future aggressiveness and despirationthese people have the audacity to think that they can kill someone and then beg for their lives like btw has anyone realised that there is another little kid there with his mum r u telling me he killed somebody too dangi would of done the same and i would say that if you arent going to risk it for the biscuit then you are unreliablei love how the kid is just holding his skull weapon so calmly while watching a mans arma get cut offüíÄwait‚Ä¶ i just realized that people would have automatically completed the first round as the body regenerates cells and others die off constantly and a cell is a living organisim rightif these people want to survive so much then they should probably go and do something instead of expecting to leech off of people who go out and earn their survival like dokja doesyes lets go dokjaaaaa i really love his character its a breath of fresh air im so happy dokya isnt the stereotypical goodtwoshoes im so tired of seeing main characters doing things out of guilt and morals especially if theyre not obligated toi mean you want coins but do nothing to help its a tought world you live in you gotta earn the right to livedeath note vibes right nowi love dokja glad hes not a dumb mc actually love his villain side loldokja joey doesnt share food hes a villain a smart one that protects his comradessoooooooo coooooooooooolllbut not rlly i woulda done smth to return fire on that other evil guyoh and welcome back bihyeong fluffineeessssshiiiiiit that was so sexy damnthis unlike him~ but this is going to be exciting dokja youre so coolbihyeong~ i miss you ~~yes dokja slice themlove this don‚Äôt give in to the majority complainers who did this to themselveschaddokja slayyyyoh you want your coins back revive every single person you killed in the first scenario and give me back every bit of perfect food i sold to you ^^i dont think hes decision is not really evil if think of it those people are the one who blame him from the start so in short those type of people are just  face they only agree with you if they get alot of benefits from it without doing something think about it he work so hard to reach that point while those people are just chilling there waiting for miracle to happen doing nothing and blame other for their own misery oh my goddd i got goosebumps dokja my king hello he is so cool üò©üò©üò©üò©üò©üò©i‚Äôm freakin so enjoying this twist of personality ughhh i hate constantly seeing unrealistically good morales people bruh in this kinda situation u gotta do everything to survive it‚Äôs a two way street if ur gonna help someone hes so coolok not gonna loe they coulda put a finer face on that last panneldokja casually showing off his absolute dumptruck as he slices that man‚Äôs arm offwhy does the last slides remind me of ninang bryan from tiktoküòÇwait i just want to make sure that her god person thingy is theseus or theaus i forgot but i remember playing a game and it was labrynthy and it said something about the string the thsues guy used to navigate the doungeoun but im pretty sure were thinking ü§î rightactually i agree with him i would probably be the villain so to say if i was to a survival world like this also hes not completly selfish he did share things with his companions and gave them a very good discount too all in all hes just trying to survive and the people in there all have killed someone to survive while he hasnt so in the end the way he does things to me is pretty justifiedomfg finally a character who doesnt have hero saving syndrome      hero saving syndrome is something i created it basically means the mc tries to save everyone even when its clearly dangerousyes use the üó° i wanna see what it does üòàüòàif i had to guess dokjas moral alignment if guess that hes either chaotic neutral or neutral evilfinally but i do hope atleast the children can be savedomg dokjas new sword why is bihyeong so cute i want to hug him so badif i was in dokjas position i would have given them help immediately but probably would regret it later on because people are fickle minded they can demand for your help and forget what you did for them and turn on you later on he became that nerd into badass real quickhe actually did the right thing its good he said no coins arent cheap they should of worked hard to earn some they had all day lazy people wanting handoutshes just like meevery bitch in this platform other then dokja group survived by killing someone and now they are begging for there lifeohhhh schnapp  üëÄüëÄüëÄgoatjany goati love himthats what i would have done if i was himbro this guy so badass it‚Äôs hotüò≠üò≠ no homoifw dokja being such a dynamic mcdokja omg ily hes so  fineget disarmed  squatsman this is awesome i love a good antiherojesus loves you finally yes my insides are melting this is a top tier protagonist right here not like some cliche saint wannabe masochistic protagonist like in every other web novelmangahes so handsome constellation dark flame phoenix smiles at dokjas sudden change in personality and cruel wayshe made a good move literally half of the people there were bad people anyways they deserved itthe way dojka cut the persons arm was the coolest thing ever i have seen all weekshit escalated realquickhell yeahhh texting with the host snapping this is amazingdespite most people thinking that secretive plotter is the author im gonna guess its dokja himself or at least a different version of him my reasoning the fact that the secretive plotter recommended a scenario and that dokja has said that he has recommended twsa to others is the reasoning weak yes but its there and weak enough for it to be a well crafted twist in my opinioni‚Äôm absolutely in love with this story shame on me for not finding this earlieri dont care how cruel i might sound right now but just kill them all already i cant stand this anymorei really cant hate bihyung if hes this cutemoral high ground umm excuse me but this is the apocalypse yes tell them dokja üò©honestly id be so fed up i wouldve snapped a lot earlier than dokja didas he should beat they asses dokja this is why everyone likes dokjaalthough tonka is acting a little evil he probably is trying to do this to somehow reason to the people and break hans incite skill and probably earn a incite skill himself  furthermore he might himself ask the people to collectively kill hans and his henchmen which will make the people earn the required coins  go kinghyeonsyeong is a big man child and i‚Äôm here for itagain hes so hotdokja is a really interesting character ambiguous gray characters are my favorite if portrayed correctly its their fault too hahai love dokja he‚Äôs not one of those ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù but he‚Äôs more interesting love an unhinged character more of him plsi love how dokja is keeping a balance between the ryt sense of morality and the manipulative aspects of the situation while on one end he is keeping his promise to get food and is doing as much as he can to keep the ones in charge from doing anything bad he isnt tolerating any kind of manipulation and taking his stand we stan üò≠üôåyaaaasssjhdhhdhhdhdhdshshvnndndndnhf so satisfying im curious in the raw is gilyeong call dokja only by his name or he call dokja by hyung dokjaa my duudeeeegod damn dokja is cold blooded        üòó‚úåÔ∏è beat their as üòàüòàüôèüòàüòàüòàüëπüòòi love his character so much more nowconstellations smiledok smiles evilyme both but with laughterdokja do be having a cute butt doeand if i refuse on a tshirtchillshyeonseong cutiei like that it seems like dokja is becoming more like yu the longer the story goes ondream be like sharing is caring and i dont caredokja is maintaining the high moral ground as he said the first scenario was the original sin they all murdered someone to survive but have since been living on handouts failing to take responsibilities for their own lives after taking someone elses in his eyes they arent good people and have proven time and time again to be scummy or pathetic on top of being murders besides  coins doesnt seem that hard to make with these mood constellations ü§£ hell yes you dont owe these people anything they have the gull to take a life but not the balls to survive by their own accord i think he should just drop it all on han and let him use those  coins he just goti love that dokja isnt the golden child and is morally gray like so happy for it its so much more realistic i really like this dude he is giving me serious life lessons atmyou need to make an anime out of this i havent got this worked up over a story in a whilepfft at least dokji and i have the same though it‚Äôs their fault for being so dependable they should also hunt their own foodsif i were him i‚Äôll be like ‚Äúi need to take care of myself for today tomorrow and so on‚Äù called me selfish if you want but it‚Äôs survival instinct why did i smile when dokja slice that man armüíÄslayyyy them alll hun esp tht bastard incho whtever tht iswelp time to kill them allüò∂he do be kinda scarycutie bihyeong is backkkkkthe constellation of me is satisfied with your doingüòÜüòÜmy guess is he‚Äôll help ppl who help him and leave ppl behind who wrong him but who knows idfk im getting major bi himbo vibes from hyunsung since the beginning yeah glad he finally snappedoh man i missed bihyeong like he‚Äôs so adorable i really appreciate the constellations comments lolso no ones gonna talk about how the giant insect beat the stone rhino in a fightok lets be reali mean why would he give the coins he earnedeven if he give  how long they are gonna survive day day  and to how many of them he can givethe only thing they will try to do is suck him until his coins get finished ofc becoz he looks easy among ones with high coinsinho or they may even kill himand then go to another thats how it workswhat a badasswonder what the constellations thought of that stop using your money on coins ii didi just think it‚Äôs funny and creative how they incorporated the constellations reaction to different situationsi dont know how the angel will react thoughhe attac backthe constellation the sleepy chaos is too lazy to interactcheon inho keeps getting on my nervesbro they didn‚Äôt risk their lives to stay alive why should he share with lazy cowardsi know this guy is tired i feel bad for all of them i mean probably all those people killed or let someone died in order to survive yes the good thing to do would be to share but why should he really i do think that moral is an important thing and kindness is a great value to have but you cant force other people to be kind nor righteous specially in a world like that and especially when theyll most surely turn their backs on him once he stop been useful i dont like many of his decisions but i understand themis it just me or is bihyeong looking more like the demonic child of monokuma and pikachuto be honest people probably thought there wouldnt be a survival fee so they mightve bought food with the rest of those coins so in a way he is kind of responsible for their deathyeah bihyoeong is back i thought they removed him bachade he made the contract but i guess not nice though hed be really cute if he wasnt such a sadistah a fellow antihero i see i really wanna find out who is the secretive plot constellation ook like um naofumi was like this  the stupid princess  lied got him in trouble and he became a good bad guy  just like dokjakinda wish we could see his total coin count would k really break the banknoooo don‚Äôt lose your mindhah plopbeautifuloooh that hurt woah dokja hejehehwbnehd so coolüò≠food horder is pleased by dokjas actionsi mean he‚Äôs not wrong but he‚Äôs also not rightitd be funny if he sold out mr suit for his k coinsi jus noticed this but the art style is similar to unholy bloodthe entitlement really jumped outhyeonseong lee looks a bit like our voltron space dadabsolutely no onedokja the concept of what we know as what is good and what is bad left this world when this game started damn perfect response reminds me of those beggers in assassins creedthe way i smack my leg from that scene can be heard all the way to the next villagefr you wanted to live you cant take care of your selfthat old man is uselessinteresting ü§© i really want this to be a book so i can keep with me and i can recommend to others oh get over yourselffinally a realistic character me why would i give my coins to you too i just find it funny that the sound effect for dokja cutting of that mans hand is plopüò≠üò≠i dont know why but i like the main character always teaching the person in wrong a lessonoooop if he lost his finger did he loose his money xdoh he‚Äôs somewhat of an evil character evil in the way that he causes grief to those who care about himdokja i love youyay bihyeong is backi love how dokjas a morally grey character  i completely agree with everything he did  it makes sense cuz  hes not obligated to anyone and he is kinda helpful to some people so yeahomniscient reader huge chicken legsits finger lickin goodi mean dokjas right theyre the ones who survived because they killed people and now they blame dokja for them not being able to survive because of the lack of coins so pathetic and what a hypocritedude was like no thanks hes backdamn dokja yes kinggg üòåhave i ever said how much i do love dokja üòñ‚ù§ ahhhh and the story is barley beginning gosh damn someone pass me some chicken wings this is getting goodwould dokja count as a morally grey character ü§îoh finally this is what ive been looking for to an mcwell it is true if you can not survive on your own in that kind of world why would you still wanna live üëÄshart getting realomg smilethose ppl deserve this  they already commited sin in the first scenerio and now they r blaming dokja for this situation heck yea dokja made the ryt decisionwhy is everything going so smoothly people give the coins dokja why people kill that bastd dokja big mistake slash people sht  readers yesssssssthat was unexpected i thought dokja would defer the crowd to that han guy who has  coinsi wonder where this will gohyeonseong lee has begun too simp on you üòÇüòÇüòÇif he has the most coins that means he has the most fighting experience some people should know that instead they should bargain with himthere are people like them everywhere manipulated by others and just live following the flow they dont have any passion to pursue and go with the majority even i am like that sometimes this just gave me a smack on my head watch out junghyeok yu theres a new protagonist in townyaaasss dokja yaaaasssssswow dokja is really cool but why didn‚Äôt he throw that guy who killed him under the buson that last panel dojka got üéÇüéÇüéÇhahaha i like this f@ckng reader this type of character is what i want to see may the f@ckng creator make more characters like this hahaha f@ck you guys btwas marcus always says no refundsthis is true shit bro why you gotta be helpful and all that stuff selfishness is human nature but they bought the food with their coins earlier then they want a refund smham i sensing light yagami vibes right nowgive his food back if they

reading solo leveling this webtoon is so good it reminds so much of solo leveling and i like how they dint copy solo leveling and made it their own thing every week i have to wait for a new chapter for solo leveling but now to wait i can read this this is probably my second favorite webtoon behind solo leveling i love this bookdokjas development is impressive  his judgment based on logic and reasoning and him not letting anyone wear him down or manipulate himits a leader quality üëè his eyes went from innocent at the start of the series to downright badass nownow he pulled it out and slammed it on the tabledokja is a true capitalistholy fricking moly i love this webtoon who else read the web novel im up to ch now üòé btw im bragging %did sangah notice what dokja was doing when he was trying to see her personal attribute im afraid of what will happen to his group now so far they have all trusted him because he has helped them out to some degree but after he cut off that guys arms and isnt helping anyone then maybe they will go against him too if they did how would that change things and how come he didnt out the other guy didnt he get a bunch of coins after taking the last blow of the monster dokja beatremember  the name roecleanconstellation galiate is speechlessi want some of his wits also his ability to read the room and say no impresses me to an extreme levelthis manga is exactly my type sad thing is i cant buy coins cuz im broke cliffhangers are illegaldepending on others is not a bad thing but if they tell you to depend on them otherwise that would be cruel to them üòîshits going down mananyone else thought dokja is doing hood rnthe constellation fangirl shipper is pleased with this developmentpeople giving all they got just to live another day hes a reader its understandablethe moment dokja drew his sword i heard megalovania begin to playdude that last scene was sooo bad asome people bout to get torn upi feel like hes a little too prepared for this world that right now hes not fully accepting what around him is real hes just doing what hed dream of doing for years while reading the story i think theres going to be a moment where he really reflects on his actions and maybe breaks down ngl sangah gave away her attribute and sponsor with this but since it‚Äôs major spoilers i‚Äôll refrain from saying anything wait bihyung was the one responsible for the item box jeez i‚Äôm on chapter  and that‚Äôs still new info aww they‚Äôre all so happy and now they‚Äôre not i gotta say inho was clever but dokja was just two steps ahead heythe cursed guy got k coinsso once they realize that he‚Äôll be chased by the others xdlol dokja‚Äôs not just gonna give these people welfare they don‚Äôt deserve itwhat about the deamon killer with k coins wheres he at throw that btch under the buslook at the flick of that wristüíÄhe looks so psychotic in that last panel i love this character so fking muchyeah if it were me id be a clear looks like you fellas are gonna die today siiiigh i wish i werent broke then i could read the next seven episodesim so proud a main character with some gutsdokja i love you i deada died when he said that üòÇi wonder how will be the character development of dokja hmm me when my sister tries to take my food her gimme summ me why should i what really shocks me about this story is how no one out of the main group has said anything about their family members its so sad to be taken away from everyone you love so fast gosh thats why  i really really like this webtoon wooooh plot twistimmaculatemans grew moon ballsthat guy i dont have enough coins to give coins to all this poor peopleme if i was dokja bitch do i look as if i caredidn‚Äôt what‚Äôs his face sell them food toome reading all the episodes  times wiating for the next oneplop plop the dudes arm got chopped choppedi love dokja‚Äôs character he‚Äôs not going to be the main character that always wants to do the right thing even when it could cost him his life he‚Äôs more logical and i think that‚Äôs gonna make the story a lot more interestingthe next week well see a lot of blood and i cant waitthing is he still kinda is maintaining the moral high ground who knows what these people did in the initial scenario on top of many already having shown to be straight up bad guys particularly those led by the gang leader dude so not only is it not a stretch to assume these people arent as innocent as they seem but its also very likely that they werent lucky and killed some bugs like dokjas group did which considering what dokjas thoughts have been this is exactly what hes thinkingthe man snapped lmaogod dayum double cheeked up üò©üò≥dokja showing them what‚Äôs upbesides that guys hands hes so hotjust walk to him poke poke poke with that iron thingy and  coins rewarded from the neet godthat was one hell of a turnthe way my voice cracked when i screamed hell yedokja made it clear that hes not messing around why would anyone take him as a push overoh theres gonna be one for female character and she go be a badass this is so good i loving this so farüòÑcan‚Äôt wait to see what happens nextit‚Äôs the apocalypse bishesü§£ something had to snap eventually he was petering on the edge of this from day onei have to wait  days for the free episodenooo i neeed moreit would be cool if dokja ends up being the antagonist and the protagonist remains the same he did say the regressor lost his humanity after regressing  times maybe dokja will lose his over time given how strong he is itll be interesting to see how characters like sangah can beat his fourth wall ability especially since he has no character profile on her it is possible to beat dokja since gilyeong already has an idea of what dokja is capable ofif im remembering this correctly isnt the cost of a human life  coins so if he killed half of them probably the ones trying to kill him then he could save the other halfi feel like dokjas alignment would be neutral because he seems to fit into a morrelly grey area seeing as he isnt evil but then he also isnt good either its really cool to see characters such as dokja who dont stick to morals but still arnt evil i‚Äôm in love with this webtoonhe got you the food twice you expect him to help you when you didn do shidemon like judge of fire best constellationdokja done did snapped and

for x experience you prick give us back our coins i want a refund if it were me yelling at dokja and he said why should i give you any with that glare i would have left immediatelywell i mean since he read the comic he kinda is prob the reason why this is happening so yeahonly the smart strong and clever ones survive in this scenario you need to do whats best for you in this case become a villainsome people will resent him but thats just what he needs to docan i jus say im loving this because im having a great time seeing dokja breaking all this mf                        bada good guy i took that line from cinemawins he is a good youtuber subscribeliterally their fault they dont have coins like boi when will you learn that your actions have consequencesbadass mode activatingoh shit

partüò´üò´üò´perisheveryone sharing is caringdokja man fck sharingif only the democratic party could stand up to the republicans that stronglydokja is true neutral maybe even evil neutral definitely not any gooddokja is a dope mc tlike bish if you wanted to survive should have gotten the other scenerioi freaking love this form the looks of it dokjas alignments is going to be neutral goodthis is survival game who just who will share their advantage to others üòÉüòÉyes dokja slay kinglmao i would‚Äôve asked them for a scholarship essay üòå earn your share bishhhhthat scene right there reminded me of light and lyesssfinally the killer instinctactually i dont know if i would have been capable to refuse helping others but i love how he responded to them i am totally in love with this comic and i wanted to ask if you have a book in the making or possibly making this into a anime series i will buy all of them as soon as they come out  this is the best comic i‚Äôve read in so long and you literally have me hanging on a thread can‚Äôt wait to read some more your loyal readerdokja is not one to stick to being the gold coin of the people and that is great because it is proof that u owe nothing to no one and u are not entitled to them and honestly i wouldnt share coins either if i were in the place of dokja cuz he worked hard and killed beasts to earn those coins and they think just by threatening him they will get coins hell naw get off ur asses and go do something useful for once lmaooooodayum the art looks so much like solo leveling im sooo excited yheeeeeeits so good to see something different fuck heroism life is hard and heartlessgive me some coins i wanna read what happens next otlhaha dokja is pissedlets goooaaaahhh i love this mc he‚Äôs not like tho‚Äôs mc who will always choose to do the ‚Äúgood‚Äù things this is getting to be more interesting and i love itoh damn dont get any closer or you gonna look like a trex  with short armsholy shiiii nuggeysgangstaoh my gosh yes i‚Äôve been searching for a story like this great route to take with this development üòçüòçi miss this savage dokjayou have activated bad ass modei love dokja i would have killed them all as soon as they started asking for my fooddokjas reaction serves them all right üòÇüòÇ they killed someone in the first scenario and now they want dokja to give the coins for which he sacrificed many thingsüßêüßêohh i love his crazy eyes still those poor peopleugh that was so sexy of dokjathe constellation  asks for five coinsdokja im your proud and loud simp did he really think dokja would just let them kill himnooo i want to read moree sobsyess slice themaye rambo kill them all an donedokja is so cooli would‚Äôve said that cursed jerk off has thousands of coins he is pissedomg i missed bihyeong sooooooo much ^^ üòöüòöüòç glad that hes back yall being like the moral high ground um bro it‚Äôs even the moral high ground to give them coins i wouldn‚Äôt say that decision is morally not good at all obviously it‚Äôs isn‚Äôt the bad thing but like jdjeh yeits true it does look pathetic to blame dokja like its their fault for not go hunting for the mf coins dokja is such a cool character i love characters like himglad the survival fee only exists in the story otherwise i‚Äôd be dead right now üòÖüòÇ i have zero coins on webtoon & it‚Äôs  right nowfuckemim here just hoping that gilyeong and others in the group wont get scared or distrustful of dokja because of this or telling him that he should help them those people dont deserve it and dokja is % right with taking that approach even if he helped them theyd never pay backi really love this webtoon so freaking satisfying omg im in loveüòçüòçüòçunlike other male leads his plots are different and alot more intresting neither op nor weakwell a man tries to murder you to survive at the orders of a coward so you make an example out of him perfectly reasonable in the apocalypseyes that badass moment im waiting for he trynna survive the apocalypse okayno time for begging noobs just get good smhsuper coolfreak school ami right fellasyess yess take my moneyyyyou don‚Äôt always have to be kindariadnes thread sjsndbdis he going to go full lelouchwow i dont agree how he handled the situations but then again when the other guy is like that the rest wont listen to what he wants to say  but this is so amazing tt_tto kawaii koto‚Äúdokja is not like that‚Äù she saidgirl don‚Äôt do it dokjadokja be like oh please just shut updokja adios ‚Äúamigos‚Äùtook dudes arms ok that was hot ü•µü•¥ü§íü§íü§íü§íwell its true that everyone there had to kill someone or something to even get that far and they have nothing to offer him still i hope he doesnt go full edgelordi like how dokja chose a nonethical way the next chapters are going to be üåüimmaculateüåüo holy mother of god this made him x hotter ü•µthats my baby loving how closely this follows the novel glad to be able to see the characters ive only read about drawn out and coming to life this toon makes my wednesdays betterwe love seeing morally grey characters man give me someone i can really relate too wait didn‚Äôt the other guy who got cursed have the most coins everyones gangsta until dokja shows upnext week needs to be here tmmrüò≠üò≠it‚Äôs the apocalypse at a certain point it‚Äôs everyone for themselves ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èjust a reminder to all the people who want him to share because its the right thing to do all of these people begging for coins are murderers and its not like hes obligated to help them either just because he is the main charactermy man dojka is going for that chaotic neutralevil routesavage dokja  i admit it i am bored of all good and soft main leads i want something worth and here comes dokja the savage king   actually in real life everyone is selfishblood for the blood godeveryones coming up with big brain comments and im here like lol dokjas hoti love this sword it makes me feel like im welding a idk justsomething good ya knowdaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn that was sickkill them alli hadnt thought of the first scenario like that they all killed someone else to be here and thus nullifies any reason to even attempt for a moral high ground most of dokjas group killed insects and remains for the time being non murderers very interestingits easy to say this cause its a fictional story but not everyone was gonna survive anyway why not just get rid of the pricks and assholes like thisthe decision he take might be seem wrong but tbh if i was at his place i would do the same thing i guessyeah cut their asses thats mah boyi would have had them compete for the coins like top five get a loan for the survival fee and maybe i‚Äôll let them join me or fight for me later to pay it back their debt pahahahahaha i love psycho dokja hahahahahais there no one mention about how gilyoungee calling dokja  in the novel he call dokja hyung since he is younger than dokja maybe its better to change how gilyoungee call dokja in the next episodethey fucked up they fxcked up they fxcked up my mans went off not like they can cancel himi like the scans translation of the last scene more it was more epic and cool which got me excited for the next chapters this mess youre all in      do you really think its my fault goosebumps all over my body after that linefinally im sick of these people who just wait for help and do nothing that inho cheon too his character is disgusting people like him never admit their mistakes and push the blame onto others all the time while making it seem that theyre a saint despicable i agree with dokja those people are being pretty selfish even though they want to survive they cant be aggressive and start asking for a refund of what they already ate sotoo late people üíÄooh its starting to get interesting teehee üòÜüòÜaye yoi screamed out loud when he cut his arms off he‚Äôs serious imagine you attack someone and they whip out a sword and chops your hands off ah a normal dayyes suddenly the apocalypse is turning into a double apocalypse he can‚Äôt give all these people coins everyday just to survive dokja has no real obligation to these people they never saved his life he only profited off of them and the only people he really has ties to is the people in his party so i stand by his decisionbihyeong is backüò≠‚ù§Ô∏èoofhe does have a point everyone there is likely a murder and the people who tell him to be a good person are the worst ones well they are the one who demand food and now they are putting the blame on dokjawow such a pathetic humansüòïi want to see the thug leadee dieüòèi want to see the thug leadee dieüòèhe gonna kill that blonde and when he does i‚Äôll be laughingwell he did nothing wrong  everyone who managed to make it here killed somebody but did not have the guts to carryon and earn their living so no one has any obligation to meet their demands  if he lets them survive now by giving in  they will only die next round because they are incapable of surviving on their own thats  a wasted investment okay that went from  to  real quicki highly doubt dokja is gonna let the random kids die if he does then the support of his allies goes down the gutter and most the constellations gonna hate himi love this series the constellation dania twilight is laughing her teeth off due to the evil face of the incarnation dokja kim the constellation dania twilight is too broke to gift you  coins  coins please i just need  coins to buy the next episodeugh i love main characters like this bc the plot is so interestingdokja i getchu bud thats the exact reason why i dont like to play a hero every person will ask u about ur morals i have read this novel til the end just incase you know survival of the fittest bitchesdokja looks more handsome when hes being mean are interested to see your moves to me dokja seems like a good guy but instead of giving handouts he‚Äôs teaching others to be responsible for their actions and in his own ways helps his friends enjoy this type of kim dokja while you still can this man is going to throw handsboi this world is twisted now and days so survival is the way to go not that i  percent agree with dokja but still i love the twistsy e swhere did those huge drumsticks go ü•∫we get dokja is a badass and the other people are idiots but is no one going to talk about hyeonseong lee and his sheild its so sparklyhehe im excited to see everything illustrated i recently picked up the novel and am on chapter  things haven gotten extremely interesting i recommend giving the novel a try if you ever have spare time ^^badassthis is funholy shitscary but real fing cooldamm hes neutral i dont know why people mad he cant look after others with no disregard to his own life in my opinion people should never be blamed for doing what they need to do to survivei love dokjas character aint like some typical protagonist with golden heartthis is a prime example of a good protagonistyeah bitches stop free loadingtheres a lady with a little boy i hope he does share some coins with them though vg is fascinated by your story and is waiting for new episodes he have no coins vis it me or dokjas really hot with that swordjust like the people in this current chapter i need coinslove it novel plot is really good and now the drawings i dont deserve this one bitcharacters like dokja are my favorite everyone its his faultdokja lemme tell you somethinlemme tell you somethinremeber communism works in theory but when put into practice it fails horribly everyone at the shelter should know thatuno reversed that green shirts threatooh~ dokja is so tenseyes boy ask for some respect if i may her skill reminds me of hisokas bungee gumüíÄunbroken faith in action looks absolutely stunninghe is taking a very interesting route had it been me i would have also refused to disclose little to any information as well fearing that it would cost my life however im kind of concerned to his development as an individual because in the beginning he was shy and seemed nice enough now he has become nearly similar to the regressor and its quite hard to hd anything against him when any other person in his shoes wouldve done the same bihyeong i missed yougreat chapter dokjas character is super interesting im very excited to see how this scenario endsbut i‚Äôm just a kidüò≠if i was grown and had lots of mobey i would turn this into animedokja is soo cooli rate it    lowkey the big ego dudes fault cause he built a community that became like thati know that the crowd of people are heavy hypocrites but i really cant blame them theyre just trying to survive by buying food and asking for help from people who can help them its just a survival instinct and also imagine if you were in that situation you dont have powerful friends maybe youre not very good you dont have a good constellation and youre broke most importantly youre not the main characterprotagonist in the story at all so you have to live its just pitifuli love it  this character us going closer to the chaotic neutral side but sticks firmly in true neutral this way in terms of dnd allinment checks he could instantly alter his actions to output a spicific looking outcome like he looks true chaotic evil then  maybe  if your pushing it episodes later he is neutralhe need to get to the alignment slowly  and slowly he looks like the ideal lawful good protagonist instead he is a neutral character who is on for the ridecant wait for kim dokja whipping those bastard assesomg getting these updates is always one of the highlights of my studyfilled week im really interested to see how dokja turns out i love the direction its going in right nowyeeeeeesssss we love a morally grey characterjudgment time kim dokja is awesome xdonline schoolhome work can wait the childs life is more important must protecc‚úä‚ù§god i love it  when character don‚Äôt take any sh√Æt üòå dokja is an ultimate savage loli just wanna binge thislook at those happy blushing face lee hyunseong is such a dorklets go dokja whoooooooooprotecc bby gilyeong my bby leemans speakin the teuth they all killed on the first round and everything they did up til then was their choice so they cant really blame amyone but themselvesdokja has a point here while he obviously wants to help he doesnt owe these people anything if they failed the test they failed the test he doesnt have to sacrifice his life for the sake of somebody elsepeople erase my foolish decisions and give me coins again so i dont suffer my own consequences dokja no ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüó°Ô∏èüó°Ô∏ècant he just finish the scenario and save everyone from payingdokja is added to the list of dark haired mcs i simp for thank you creator for my birthday giftüò™‚ù§im i the only one that finds the cotton ball thing cute‚Äúoh his arm got cut off huh‚Äùdokja you lit üí™he didnt  have does kinds of morals he just didnt want to stand out but was forced to do so by a jackass with the power to manipulate the masses i‚Äôd kill someone for more coins to read ahead in this webtoon üòêi really want this to be turned into an anime it would be so good viva la revolutionbut it kinda made sense all those people survived because they killed someone and now that they can‚Äôt even manage to survive on their ownyou prick that t man is soo pathetic i cant stand ityou know what i like about dokja hes not like your usual mc who wants to save everyone  who doesnt want anyone to die who wants to be the hero hes not really sympathetic and he sees things as they are eg these people were shit to me before so why should i help them do they deserve my help he wants to do whats best for him just like they all do except that hes not leaching off of others hes doing it himself i really respect him as a character for thatsome of you will die but that is a sacrifice i‚Äôm willing to make he looked like a badass at the end just like a villain and i absolutely love itüíñi am so hyped for next episoderealistically speaking most of these people are going to die anyway maybe not today or even tomorrow but they wont last with the monsters as a whole most people are weak they look for easy ways out and for others to do for them giving the money back or paying their way for  more day only prolongs the inevitable and leaves you with even more people begging tomorrow this decision had to be made sooner or later this series is so amazing i‚Äôm so excited every tuesday after a hard day at work to read thiscounter offer nodokja you bastard that was too badassu go dokja i missed you dokkaebi if that was the spelling loldang dokja is ice coldinsert evil giggle if words dont work they bout to talk to these ‚ú®hands‚ú®what a badass protagonistwill i get killed if i say yesquestion for people who read the manhwa gilyounges stance in the last panel shows he is ready to throw hands for his new father figurehell yeah no stupid goodytwoshoes here babyhe could of shifted it to the rich annoying guy i dint remember the name of whi kill stealed to get k coinsdokja did the right thing you can‚Äôt blame some one for everything game is game i get excited when he cut off that mrons hand cant wait ‚àÜ decision]he looks so badassüòªüòªüòªüòªomg slayyyythat one guy who has over  coins be like $$$see this is what im saying omniscience has a cost and that cost is that every interaction you have down to the smallest level is an equation you just need to solve for the best possible outcome and it doesnt matter what that takes or gains because its deffinitionally best its basically blue orange moralitytbh i dont like the heartlessness but at the same time i know damn well id do the same thing honestly its hard to judge this situation bc he doesnt know if everyone there actually killed someonesome couldve had the same idea with the bugs but at the same time its most likely they didi love his character right nowhyeonseong omgüòñüòñüíñthe leader of the major group is so manipulative i dont think any of the about to die characters tried it but if they had some coins left just not enough for the survival fee i might have been tempted to negociate with dokja to an exchange in order to die with a full belly like the last smoke but instead a last steaki know they probably have to do that but i laugh every time i see the notice of depictions of violence like you should have written that into the manga description its in almost every chapterüòÖgod damnü§ûü§ûblushin like a maniac rn ü§≠ü§≠what kind of dummy rushes someone with a sword personally‚Ä¶ who even cares bout these people they‚Äôre bloodthirsty as soon as things turn sour and they can‚Äôt see that the obviously evil leader is in the wrong here üòíedit and if you want to survive in an apocalypse situation like this you have to figure out a way to survive being a mindless background groupthinker is a surefire way to die ingenuity is the way to goha people with no moral tryna be moral loli really like how dokja doesnt try to compromise with everything in his way pretty refreshing tbhi think this would happen when something like this happen  those people should start taking responsibility for their own after killing people from st round damnnnn that was so damn good so satisfying üò©üò©yes dokja slay slay those bitchesyes good choice dokjaslay dokjai really like the constellations they seem extremely cool especially the prisonerim happy he did that hyeonseongs reaction to the shield is pricelessahhh this feels so much better im tired of those characters who try to stay at societys standards you go dokjayay morally grey characters are my favoriteyeah kindai love that he is not niceamazing story and art please support the authortranslatori agree with dokja theyre in a position where they have it make an effort to survive and its the law of the chain strong and weak ones and he doesnt have to share his coins that he collect with his and team effort also you share once and theyll keep coming all the time cause they want the easy wayso agree totally with dokja hes not wrong or baddeserve so muchyesss ugh that was satisfyingslice oh your arm hit my blade congrats youve lost a couple of pounds loseryou seem confused you dont have power over him because he cant kill every single one of you you had power over him because he didnt want to that white thing are cute lol yet scaryso should i just ignore that there was no comments for the past few chapterswhats so bad becoming a villainoh yeah things are starting to get interestingbihyeong is taking me out üò≠üò≠dokjas character is interesting than most protagonists ive ever seenwait hold on arent we the readers the constellations in this casehe unlocked the rinnesharingan thats all i gotta sayhan myungoh had around  thoque delicia finalmente um enche lingui√ßa dessa apanhando morality doesn‚Äôt even exist in this world anymore it all depends on the person‚Äôs values and dokja‚Äôs got pretty unpredictable values im sure he cares about the people he considers his team now and he even saved huiwon without expecting to gain anything in return which is odd cause he‚Äôs been doing things for his own benefit he also lied to gilyeong so he‚Äôd still have some hopeoptimismgod im loving dokjaman i love this but it makes sense since his whole thing is like im not the protagonist so why should i be a herogileyeong has a power to communicate with animals how cooolhe is soü§åüèªthe constellation  loves the mche should at least give the coins back to the people that bought food he knew they would charge coins to live and took advantage not cooli like it dokja kim  sharing is caring my ass idk but i like dokjaright decisionno hesitation i like ityeeessss go tell em bruhhyou know i feel sorry for the small children unless their parents held someonesomething down and mental scarred by having them kill

development is soooooooooooooo goooooodüòçüòçüòçthe people sharing is caring dokja no its communismat first i disagree with dokjas actions but in second thought i realized he was really just fending for himself while it seemed like dokja swindled coins from the crowd knowing that the food he sold would vanish anyway and thus decreasing their chances of survival he only did it because the pressure was placed unto him plus he really didnt anticipate that survival fee so the incited mob were just reaping the consequences of their gullibility in letting themselves be manipulatedthe constellation ybahmedd laughs at the despair of those who tried to kill dokjayasssi genuinely love the fact that dokja is an antihero heyy our favorite fluffy pokemon is back oh my goshh hes so cool i love himmdamniminluvüòçre leerlo es asombroso como siempre a main character who‚Äôs merciless huh new to me but i‚Äôm looking forward to this edit if this ever happened in real life i would‚Äôve done the same thing nglim not hating in the least but i love the influence solo leveling had in breaking more mcs away from the traditional build dokja is a bossdokja üòâüòâüëåüëåüòåüòåüòåüíñüíñbye bye arms stan dokja and his cake jk pls he is so hot i feel like eating him üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠wüëåüèªwowwww‚≠êthis is really awesome byebye armsomg omgdokja is developing moral is a creation of the previous world in this world moral dont existoh damn o he got unarmed omgkirito ngh dokjaam i the only one who thinks hes hotü•µi love dokja‚Äôs character smoh god hes so hothdjdjfwhjsthcdamnlike you should only get help if you deserve that if not  dont make moral excuse rightwhy there is no music im literally being so loud right now just rooting for himanti heroi just hope the others dont lose trust in him for this because hes not even in the wrong tbhbro why tf is he built like the mc from tomb raider king all the characters have a really big similaritytjats my boynice dokjatbh im agree with dokja ü§£dokja is my unbothered king idk i think he is weeding out the evil people to help the good ones i think morally he does have the high ground on thisi am so curious at to the type of person dokja ishe isn‚Äôt a hero and not a villian eitherwell i meannn itll just be a nuisance if this type of people actually surviveskraaazythese people knew what was coming and if they have other people like kids or elderly to pay for as well hold off on food for a day if needed do something anything to get them that doesnt involve waiting til the last minute and going mental on this guy that worked hard for his im so glad he didnt back down or cave in to this worthless leaders gamesplop went his handgooooddd my manpeople really get crazy when they are about to die why did they come back aywaysyes yes its starting to be interesting i love dokjathese idiots why did i laugh tho whats wrong with mewhy should he give them his coins they are just going to die soon i doubt they‚Äôll even make it the next payment point that‚Äôs a complete waste that‚Äôs not being a villain that‚Äôs just being smart do what you have to to survive i love how our mc is moral or immoral depending on the situation its refreshing that hes not % moral or % immoral dokja is really out here explaining the theme ‚Äúsharing is not caring‚Äùthe goon squad was so ready to attack pathetic scum he aint rich for nothing üòÇdokja worked very hard to get the coins and the weapons he worked very hard to level up to survive so what right do those people  who have done nothing but living on other people‚Äôs efforts just like a parasites  have to ask him to give them coinshes just surviving with a reason guys no need to be so poopy i completely agree with this decision because as shitty as it is this is the reality of this world and he knows that things cant go back to normal and if theres a wish that can then if they die at this point it wont matter so rather increase his chances as much as possible right now and keep as many coins to himself as possible because if they have to depend on him to get coins they wont survive in the future eitheryes finally hes not dumb and trying to act like a hero like other mc in every storyiesamen to that you made your bed so lie in itüòíwowdokkaebi looking cute rnone pair of hand is gone  pair moreyou are special you are loved black swordsman oo this mans looks like nothing but a main character bruhspoiler warning please dont read this comment if you arent far enough how

theres no mercy for dishonest gangsters give us back our coins give me back my foodhonestly the people got that far by killing at the very least they could try to complete the scenarios although people in crisis rarely think rationally especially with that shit startertiny bihyeong  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ îhis legs were cut off his arms were cut offi would stand in line for thisthere‚Äôs always room in

sentence you wouldnt do that so why would he have to help them when they have nothing useful for him agree with his pov can somebody clarify if the completion of scenarios accects every member of the group or just who is fulfilling the requirementsi would‚Äôve have said ‚Äúwhat do i get for‚Äù or ‚Äúprove your worth‚Äù because these guys are just desperate anywayi would have paid them off in order to recruit an army to deal with inho  with people dependent on dokja for food and then their very lives he could easily seize control of the station  but i suppose power isnt his goalnot a single coin

people who were close with me and part of my group  the  women the boy and the other mani like this side of dokja i think dokja will end up as an antivillain or an antihero as we can see here he is still a good guy but has some evil qualities by not sharing his coins though i do agree with his decisionmeanwhile ima take a guess as to who sangahs constellation is httpsenwikipediaorgwikiariadne

once and again and in the end people would still die and he‚Äôd be in an unfavourable situation with little to no coins he is not assessing the situation morally but practically in the long run he cannot really help themyuh dokja just snappedwelp natural selection bishes morals wont save you rn and thats how that man became withered chicaüòÅactually i liked dokjas decision as all the people there didnt had any morals right now & they are just burdens with selfish motivesits apocalypse do i have time to be nice i dont think sogod im so glad dokja isnt some kind of a saint too naive to just give coins to those people thats the reality you gotta knock or even slice some arms to give sense to some people loli love dis me whenever someone wants me to share my food because they think

thems artsanyone say antihero because i thought i heard antihero lmaotell em dokjai thought dokja was just going to say myeonghan has  coins to spare so he doesnt become the villain and doesnt lose

gonna die tonightthis is badhow can they just say that likethey should try to prove thier worth instead of trying to kill him like how dumb are youhe have more coins because of some reason peoplehes right though why should he give them coins also if he did the next time the fee shows up they are going to rely on him to give them coins then it turns into a cycle which might end him with no coinsi like the fact that the others are still behind him obviously positioned to protect himüî•yesss use logic not moralitygod damn  this boy has some principles and im excited to see them like of course u ugly dead meats why would he do that hes not ur legal guardian or anything square the fk upi called there was gonna be a giant mantis i knew itthis is amazing dokja is awesome i always love a badass character damn üò®üò±my jaw lower than my short a of yessssss hes backwait wait wait wait wait he can essentially borrow skills right what if he borrows incite to turn everyone against the guy who

them allwhat i think he should do is give them coins but only if they give him the survival reward so they all live  gain respect for dokja and he also gets his coins backman even tho bihyeong is kinda a ass he gets better on in later scenesfinally  a character who is looking out for themselves before other people it‚Äôs refreshing bihyeongthank god i was praying that he didn‚Äôt give the

we have seen so faredit but i never thought a normal giant insect would have the rank of a monarch thanks soooo dokaebi communication is basically private chat love how he doesn‚Äôt give a care in the world let‚Äôs be honest this is a realistic way of looking at things damn those eye bags tho our poor dokja isn‚Äôt getting enough sleep üòîhe is the goat so what if he has cheat codes it‚Äôs all about self in the endi i am speechless hahaha the dokakabi is acting all shy and jealous cus dokja did something awesome and he wasnt their to gain credit for the stream dokakabi  so ugh noticed wile

has a bit of sociopathic behavior but he can still function he has the so called onoff switch with realistical adaptable human thinking and moral reasoning if neededoh no hes very pissed offim here and i regret nothingthe constellation hanae_saku liked dokja a lot  coins have been awarded i used the free coins earned for an event because i want to support the artist i hope to read moregosh dangit i want more i just fast forward using all my coins and i dont regretno one is good they wanto still moneyi cant wait for more updates ü§©ü§©ü§©im all about the daily uploads  i will gladly spend my money for this webtoonbut from what i read this guy is pretty much the line and does who desire to disrupt that line is considered an annoyance i for one respect that is there a new chapter every dayman i really hate praying mantis even as it isinlove yeeeessss we needed this dokja doesnt deserve to take smack from anyone show em whos boss imagine spending all of your weeks worth of lunch money for coins without your parents knowledge i think i messed upi dont remember what the little demon is thats controlling the game but i like the guy i know hes demonic and all but i still like himi like him as a character not the other wayfirst time reader opinions i think dokja is about to learn a new bookmark skill but what would happen if two incite skills clashed interesting to see indeedlove this omgf u f them what makes me the enemy love this twist and realismour protagonist is such a badass i love his reasoning and how he can be so cold sometimesi think im going to reread this webtoon from the very beginning its just so very goodi feel bad at how easily they are corrupted always a great read im definitely hoping you an get funding for a tv showcant stress the notouch policy enough these daysgotta love characters that do what they need to survive and don‚Äôt puss up at every turngetting super tasty lemme see tha da next clup pleaze kind sirwell if theyd actually work harder they would have coins like dokja said they killed someone to stay and why should this be his problem go boy chop chopthe constellation greedy storyarc devourer alpha  thinksdikja should buy the peoples  loyalty  if they want coins he should  get something  in return the constellation  greedy storyarc devourer alpha  thinks dokja  should go ahead and kill that dudeis this still going to update daily this mights just be me but im begging you to keep it that waywow thats cool the blooded dont dokija but it is the bosses followed because hes just being a prickthis sword is so epicbased neutral oh i love dokjathe crowd is about to turn on the people who sold the food for triple the amount im glad dokja isnt a pussy idiot mcyes dokja god i love dokja this was amazing im thrilled i love thissss story now that is what i call chaotic good üòàset the tone dok clear out the useless extras and then get onto the villainsyes dokja defend yourselfsheesh dude aint playin no games with yallthe dude in the red at the end looks like he shat himselfomg this man just went sicko mode so beautiful there deadyooooooooooooooooooooooobeautiful so god damn beautiful damn bro dokja turning hella sick nowi really love how many twist and turns this story takes but when dokja goes cold face he says f those twist and turns ones desire to live should never delve to the depths of unnecessary violence applaud the player for their insight and not blame their ability to do well when others flounderidk what webtoon i love more this or the gamertake my money but in a serious note who can blame him or the people it‚Äôs about to go down üëÄi greatly approve of dokja our mc right now i mean he still has the moral high ground most of those people are there because they killed someone and still refuse to be responsible for their own lives or actions why should he help them it would actually be pointless since they wouldnt learn anything morally the right action is to let them suffer the consequences for their choices so that if they survive maybe theyll change on their owni would like a psycho mc hehe am getting tired of the good and cringey onesim so glad dokja doesnt have the saviour complex that most mcs tend to have dthissss i mean i dont like the character who always been taken advantage by others  i love how he isnt a very morally goody  shoeshes like its an apocalypse frick u toomy spirit animal kim dokjaü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§i love not morally good protagonists dokja has such an amazing characteri just wanna say i love you all so much thank you for creating this webtoon ugh i‚Äôm so glad dokja isn‚Äôt a pushover and won‚Äôt just do whatever benefits everyone else also hes so coolnice mc vibesi hope that this doesn‚Äôt have any smart clever outcome and dokja just butchers all the fools who thinks he owes them anything dokja is so woke üëçdokja and his gang are the ppl i wanna hang out with i love me a morally grey character this is the definition of ‚ú®let your inner demon shineee‚ú®the audacity of these people is rlly out of hand you ate his food that he risked his life for youve done n o t h i n g at all youre not entitled to his helpthis guy is the definition of virtue signalingyeah you tell em kdj fricking idiots xdauthor nim youre the bestyes this is a realistic character why did i wait so long to read this loving the antihero twist other than the pushover mcsim sorry but thats hotdokja is turning out to be the anti hero type hes good but he will kill if he has todokja is more and more reminding me of sung jin woohahahahahah hahahahhahahaaaaaaahahhaahhahahhaahahahahaaaaaaaaahahhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaathat character who got his arms cut off surprised pikachu faceoverhaul i know how that feelshippity hoppity my coins are your propertyumm that was hot ü•µ a whole new meaning of disarming your enemysometimes being a villain is far better than being a hero üòèüòèwoa some people in these comments genuinely scare me where is your humanity why are so many people so happy the mc might not be a good guy when did being a good person become boring if this was a real scenario and you genuinely wouldnt help people when you could at least the children in this crowd then idk what to say but you need to think about what kind of person you are damn papi you a rare breedhah this is why i absolutely love coldquiet people they al always have an interesting instinct being a villain is better than hero in my perspectiveever protagonists says ‚Äúhow pathetic‚Äù in a scary way with there pupil dilated i dont think i have ever loved a mc more than i love him i truly hate self righteous mcsat first i was like mhmm ‚Äúmen with swords‚Äù  as a joke  but bro i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a joke anymore üò´love how he reacted this webtoon is amazing through all but the mc makes it  times better  the world they live in is twisted i know but the mc is right for many reasons im seriously going to start crushing on himdokja reminds me of khun from tower of godi love that it‚Äôs not your typical righteous protagonist give me some realityidk about anyone else but i was like finally my godddgreatt character development so realistic and not idealistic tbh i would prob do the same being a good person is cool now but in a situation like that it‚Äôs jst being weak it‚Äôs jst letting others manipulate u for personal gain at that point i would sorta jst be like ‚Äúfuck it‚Äùyes finally a character whos not a bitch this is why i loved solo levelingfinally he is all out of mercynice i like that they are just evilhe has every right not to give them coins they killed ppl he can use that as an excuse if he doesn‚Äôt wanna seem evil cuz he killed bugsi think children at least deserve your help but at the end its a survival of the fittest scenario not a charitymost of the people there killed other people to survive so why should he give coinsi like the way dojka just helps people that actually does need it and i honestly love the way he is not stick on being the good ass guy but instead a fair one literally loving itdokja doesnt take shit and i love it so much pathetic humansused all their coins and blame someone else for their stupidity trash deserves to be destroyedits the apocalypse my dudes ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhi stand by dokjahe is doing the right thing i dont see these people doing anything to live other than just surviving theres a big difference they took human life to get where they are now  coins each thats  more nights of life or instead of squatting they could you know work on the scenarios at hand üôÑ dokja is taking the moral high

to stay in the station how dare you try to kill me for trying to keep you from another‚Äôs clutches gotta show some fear to be respected sometimes needy people sharing is caring me im not a care bear üíúim personally just annoyed of the finally protagonist that does something morally questionable as if every protagonist of these types of stories werent some sort of anti heroes who everytime they do something morally righteous they are like nah nah im doing this definitely for selfish reasonslike not crapping on peoples tastes here im just confused if they really dont realize that majority of web novel series have similar protagonists to here or make choice seem less edgy lateri dont disagree with dokjas choice but couldnt he have said that mr han has more momey than him even if its a lieü§îi hate how the main character is slowly turning into a psycho i really pains methis is a lesson on why socialism is doodoogee ive never had top comment trump is like the dokkaebi making rules that cost lives  lots of people will dieso wait if he lets everyone have a bite of the food wouldnt that complete the scenario for everyone so they wouldnt all lose coins unless im missing a stepi really appreciate that hes not willing to get pushed around thoughhe is kind of a bitch dont like him for looking down on those people just because he got lucky and happend to read the right story he wouldve been on their place if he didnt well no actually he would be dead from that edgeguy from the train i dont mean he should give his money to everyone but at least dont be a brat thinking they all deserved that maybe they killed insects too who knowshes lee gilyeong not gilyeong lee why you do this its korean webcomic why the names are written like in eu or america dud this shit just annoys

this is total garb_ age i mean come on just kill the sk m already & those r_ tards as well  gods sakedojka seems kind of hypocritical to me he helps out only the people he knows he even helps that little boy but when there is another child that needs coins to survive he turns a blind eye i get not giving coins to the other people but at least for childrenthe thing is that author intentionally made those plain people become evil and start blaming him so he can keep looking down on them but not all are like that and in real life there would probably be more people just crying or begging then stratight attacking him so i find him a total bitch for being that arrogant he couldve done something for example really share coins with the rest who didnt attack him it wouldnt be much at all and he would probaby get even more as donation for his deedhe couldve killed the major group and gave their coins to those in need totally so fck this mc hypocrite or he coudlve at least tried to do smth maybe he will in next chapter but i doubtcharacter i have black hair commenter his hair is black whiner omg how dare you spoil it do you all realize how ridiculous you sound when you whine about spoiling have none of you ever read a book ex harry potter then find out it gets made into a movie and be excited for it anyways even though you already know everything that happens from beginning to end  like seriously spoilers dont actually spoil anything you still enjoy the the cartoonmovie get the hell over yourselvesplease don‚Äôt speak in absolutes i don‚Äôt think the story progressed far enough you‚Äôve given us  yoo the main protagonist given broken faith a buff then gave it to the reader and you giving the a powerful judge power to jung slow down and progress the story it will just become a story of absolutes and we don‚Äôt even know his goals or what striving for this will just be like a meaningless power fantasy in sea of trash power fantasies\n"

      "Im happy with this twist im sick of characters who try so hard to stick to the moral high ground i‚Äôm really interested to see dokja‚Äôs developement at this point since he‚Äôs clearly not going to be a ‚Äògood‚Äô character i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be straight up evil but i‚Äôm excited to see the extent of his neutrality at the very least the people ‚Äúsharing is caring‚Äù dokja i don‚Äôt care ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è edit just to clarify i don‚Äôt disagree with dokja‚Äôs decision i just thought it was funny how people were trying to get him to maintain a high ‚Äúmoral ground‚Äù but he was just like nah this an apocalypse my dudesfinally a mc that makes the most optimal choice ive been getting bored of mcs always trying to be the herofor real though aside from the people dokja originally saved with the bugs everyone is a murderer they have a lot of audacity to be begging for their lives i‚Äôm down with dokja‚Äôs pragmatismwait i just noticed look at the panel when dokja cuts the guys arms you see that he is facing away from his group then look at the last panel you can see that he has his back now turned to the guy whose arms he cut off and his body is facing towards his group so that means that this man just cut the guys arms off turned around and then look over his shoulder to flex on all these people xdthis really is gonna be the best webtoon on the app and if they end up making an anime adaption you know it‚Äôll go crazyi really like the approach to an antihero type of character it‚Äôs nice to see someone who is intelligent but doesn‚Äôt magically make all the right decisions it makes him seem really human mostly fending for himself great work author please keep it up them gimme coinsdokja whythem ugh let‚Äôs just kill him and take the coinsdokja mistake slashthem pikachu surprised facei guess the guy at the end there was ‚Äúdisarmed‚Äù eh ehhlol why didnt he just let everybody know about the k coins the cursed guy with the suit hascrowd give me a refund dokja sorry there is a no refund policy give us coins dokja i missed the part where thats my problem this webtoon along with solo leveling is all i am looking forward to every weekcrowd let me get thatdokja its gone cost you an arm and legthey had time to complete the quest but they where sitting there all that time just crying about it and now its his fault pathetic pretty sure sangah has ariadne as her constellation ariadne is sometimes seen as the goddess of mazes and is credited with giving theseus a ball of string to find his way out of the minotaurs labyrinth i mean that was so iconic from that story it just seems too coincidental i dont know if a japanesekoreanchinese myth involving string exists to provide an alternative i honestly think that his decision is the goodone he needs verification that anyone he gives coins to will at least be able to offer something to him in exchange if they dont then they wouldnt be surviving very long anyways if he helped them it would probably just make them suffer longer with no hope of actually surviving and acclimating to the new world order i mean they couldnt muster coins dokja gets that much as a gift from the constellations all the timethe first theme being original sin would that mean the second theme is survival of the fittest he wouldnt be doing any of them a favor by handing out coins for free as they would be bound to the other guy they would rather take the easy path and just kill him when all they really need to do is offer either an item of their own or their services in future runs its how society is supposed to work in the grand scheme of things where all parties work at their own pace to contribute manager dude got k coins last chapter let him save the peoplem i think my favorite constellation is the secret plotterhes right he worked for his coins even with his knowledge he still had to accomplish those things to get an award this webtoon touches a lot of areas in society and its great thank you author for amazing comic i think the facts come down too no one has a moral high ground here like he said original sin they all murdered someone to be alive right now so the fact they expect some one to save them after that is ludicrous no one is good or evil here it‚Äôs just survival for survivals sakedokja is also not dokja i believe he is the omniscient reader otherwise he would cling to humanity and sins for example he would had tried to save as many people as possible but instead decided to let them choose their fates he knows what to do and how to do it instead of morals he thinks with the most logic very interesting and also very hard to stay on that path having the ability of the fourth wall also helped in move forward resistant to fear charm taunts very powerful indeedhe made a good point they all killed someone to get pass the first scenario even that little kid so if you dont take care of yourself then you dont deserve to live money grabbers jesus fcking christ the audacity of those assholesi cant wait to see inho cheon get whats coming to him üòå gonna be even more satisfying than watching little han boy become a mother ü§∞edit these arent spoilers this is just what i hope happensthrow myeongeh under the bus he‚Äôs got coins nowi love it when the main character doesnt stick to moral values like theyre in the apocalypse and they expect people to still follow the moral code even tho most if not all of then already killed someone i love love love dokja‚Äôs character i am incredibly sick of ‚Äúgood‚Äù characters that make stupid decisions because ‚Äúit‚Äôs the right thing to do‚Äù i‚Äôm fed up with the moral high ground obviously he‚Äôs not a bad guy either he‚Äôs just selfish and i don‚Äôt find anything wrong with placing your survival first he is not responsible for these peoplejean henri fabre was a french naturalist in the late s known for his books on the lives of insects if anyone‚Äôs curiousis it just me or does dokja get hotter with each passing episode i love how he looks i love how he doesnt take bull look at him hes one of the many reasons why my standards are skyrocketinggod im already so spoiled with this one episode a day lol easily my top series cant wait for morei think the important thing here is regardless of whether or not sharing coins is the moral thing dokja not letting himself be manipulated is better in the long run leaving a mob under incite‚Äôs control will only hurt him in the end not to mention giving those coins would be like taking responsibility for those lives it‚Äôs too much for anyone to really bare people are saying that he wasn‚Äôt keeping a moral high ground or that the people were telling him to keep a moral high ground and he wouldn‚Äôt but i think that he‚Äôs still got a moral high ground these people the moment they were manipulated or had to think things through resorted to murder and that‚Äôs exactly what he expected of them so why give them coins why trust them i think that despite his looks saying ‚Äòneutral chaotic with evil‚Äô it‚Äôs more like ‚Äòlawful chaotic with a moral compass‚Äôi see dokja as a survivor not good or bad just trying to livefinally this mc action makes sense in an apocalyptic world hes not bad but smarti love how they try to attack him he fights back and their expression is surprised pikachu face i don‚Äôt seem to follow why people have been saying this makes them evil they threw their own lives away unable to beat their inner fear and even attempt to survive it would be a waste to save someone like that in fact i‚Äôd say saving them just to force them into more suffering would be the evil choice if they are unable to even try and survive for themselves why not just let their suffering end it seems cruel on the surface but dokjas got a point in not being too generous people who live passively and allow themselves to get manipulated by relying on charity and sponsorships wont survive if their supporters suddenly decide to leave them be its true in the scenario and in this reality toodokja is not the protagonist of twsa so he will have to take hard and clever decisions in order to survive this game till the endand its much more fun to see him not following the moral valueshe really does look like a villain in that lase slide its so awesome no wonder the constellations are interested in him coins just means you‚Äôre alive one more day to beg for even more coins it‚Äôd be a waste hopefully dokja mentions boss man‚Äôs moniesalso i love he gave hyunsung lee a shield and lee loves him now they‚Äôre bros gotta max out that affinitydokja an actually good main characterseriously as if he‚Äôs some high level monster that you can defeat and he‚Äôll just drop coins why don‚Äôt they just break some pottery and pray for rupees do they deserve my help its an important question he cant be expected to shoulder the weight of all these people through the whole apocalypse at some point they need to stand up for themselvesi love how the author sets dokja apart while inho says ‚Äúreturn the coins to the people‚Äù it sounds like he is doing it for the good of the people and dokja‚Äôs ‚Äúand if i refuse‚Äù sounds villainess but he‚Äôs the main character and it‚Äôs refreshing that he isn‚Äôt a morally bound person but at the same time hasn‚Äôt tipped too far off that has left him insane in this situation this is absolutely one of my favorite webtoons by far and i rarely read anything other than heartwarming and romantic webtoonsfirst they wanted free food next they were too scared to help him kill the giant rats for coins third when they came back they asked for free coins thinking that he would give after that they tried to kill him and expected him to be a sitting duck finally they have the audacity to be surprised that he sliced someones arms offhonestly i love dokja‚Äôs character he‚Äôs rational and doesn‚Äôt let his emotions take the reins over his decisions he‚Äôs the embodiment of someone going against the world‚Äôs corruption while not utilizing the common ‚Äúgood prevails‚Äù trope i‚Äôm % looking forward to his journeyhyunsung lee has started to trust youdokja hmmm i can use thisi agree with dokja there‚Äôs no reason for him to help these people specially in the situation they‚Äôre inthe mc did the right decision because if they can survive just that one scenario how will they survive the next one those people is so pathetic the mc help them for food then they will blamed him for losing of coinsüòëi don‚Äôt need sleep i need the next episodeyay a gray area characterpeople who rely on others too much usually drag down the whole group because they always expect you to save them and feed of the kindness of others in a survival situation you have to either drag them with you and risk getting the whole squad killed or you have to leave them behind to save those who are able to stand alone i think dokja made the right decision because it would mean hed have to take care of a bunch of people even in the future that is not a longterm solutioni feel like dokja is more rational than evil as people are saying he makes smart decisions and calls based on logic everybody is talking about the moral high ground and how hes evil when mans is making rational decisions and being smart hes neither good nor evil hes j a guy with a rational mindthis comics unreleased episodes are starting to make me agree with coins are poweri love dokja‚Äôs personality in my opinion he is correct this is the apocalypse and he isn‚Äôt obliged to help everyone everyone brought food because they were hungry it‚Äôs their own decision what does dokja have to do with it if they wanted coins earn it themselves it‚Äôs every man for themselves i love this author already theyre the first to actually show you when the veil of civilization is torn apart by apocalypse even after murdering another person to survive these people are acting dependant on others if they dont fend for themselves no one will fight for them anymore beautiful storytellingthats one the the reasons i really like this story the mc is quite different from the standar hero üôà ill support him as far as he dont betray his team üòåüëådam i caught up to quickly again i‚Äôm so happy that‚Äôs he‚Äôs releasing quickly and with great quality i‚Äôll keep spending coins as long as they keep coming people i know that there are some people who came here from the webnovel but for those of us who are reading it for thw first time on webtoon dont google anything about omnimicent reader because it will just most likely spoil the manwha for you like it did for meedit did anyone else love hyeonseongs face when he was holding the shieldthis is absolutely perfect dokja maintains logical thinking in a time where it would be necissary to do so so it actually makes sense he isnt a hero just a guy a lucky guy but a guy nonethelessnone of you can say that dokja isnt good he doesnt do bad things he just does what is needed to survive moral ground wont work in apocalyptic world he didnt use them he just simply did what was best for him so i really like his decisiondokja badassdokja in the end of the story fucking badassü•¥well this is real interesting dokja is a unique protagonist and i absolutely love italthough those background characters are hella annoying for being hypocrites their reactions and actions are all natural i mean who did expect this to happen not even dokja dokja is lucky enough to have knowledge about the overall situation also its understandable as to why theyre afraid to go out for the quest i mean their families and friends didnt come back after they joined something like that true neutral character coming throughas a mother i say kill the greedy bastards and save the children but as a lover of apocalypse stories the kids would get him killedi am now a simp for dokja ü§öthey only show interest in dokja when they need something from him why should he share his coins with them he made the right call üò§you have me hooked dokja‚Äôs decision really gave a sense of reality to the comic most would make their characters be the ‚Äògood‚Äô guy stick to morals and would give themselves to save others dokja is a very rational character and i am excited to see where his story leads him y did i have the biggest smile on my face when he said y should i give u any am i psychodokja really takes no ones shit and i think that‚Äôs what makes him such an awesome protagonist like yeah it‚Äôs cruel but considering the circumstances he‚Äôs got every right to refuse no one else has done anything that deserves his help it‚Äôs survival of the fittest people are bound to show their ugly sides no matter whatif i was one of the people there i would be desperate and honestly feel some resentment towards dokja but id also understand that he very much risked his life to get the food and coins he has and i dont have the right to demand him to give me some especially if i havent even tried to risk my life to get them myself so i understand if they feel frustrated but it should be more with themselves and the situation what dokjas doing is perfectly fine and realisticabsolutely love this antihero what a fresh twist looking forward to the lack of romance and high action packed chapter to followi love him hes not evil just logical and fairtheyre all using scrap metal bats tools and pipes as weapons with some waving bone weapons as the highest thing there and this mf pulls out a swordhe risked his own life to get the food of course he is not going to give it all out for freei like a lot dokja just because hes not pretend to be like the hero or something like that hes just acting like the situation are and the instinct of survive the woman‚Äôs constellation has to be ariadne right like with the whole thread to get out of the dungeon thing is kinda like her and the labyrinth i mean why should he give them coins when they are threatening him i was wondering how they were going to portray the dokkaebi chat i must say i am thoroughly pleased i love the emoticons üòÇüíúthis webtoon is so amazing the art is some of the best ive ever seen it is so well done i love it the plot is awesome i normally dont like apocalypsethemed stories but this is amazing the characters are fantastic too especially dokja i love how realistic they all are i can tell how hard the authors worked on this and they did truly some of the best work ive ever seen well donedokja me too give me just coins to know what happens next in the story and then give me more and then more and then more then i will pay you back please i just want to see more of your surprising and amazing intellegence and decisions second later rip my arms god i wanna read more why cant this series just be over so i can binge it i love that hes not a hero i get tired of all the high morals and instead hes a survivor this comic is amazing what‚Äôs the old saying about jesus ‚Äúgive a man a fish he will that day teach a man how to fish he will eat every day‚Äù giving them coins doesn‚Äôt solve the issue because what about the next day and day after that they‚Äôll need someone to help them rather help themselves these people complain about morality but dont hesitate to kill people for coins at leat dokjas transparent they all knew about the survival fee yet they still bought so much food that they didn‚Äôt have any left for the fee now correct me if i‚Äôm wrong but didn‚Äôt you get coins for clearing the first situation they had enough coins there alone to survive two days but they bought large quantities of food in order to have it now doesn‚Äôt that sound like the sloth and fox sin gluttony and greed screw them dokja is definitely doing the right thing its funny how those people went from pleading for dokjas help to being completely hostile towards him talk about true colors huhunrelated but i swear to god i am screaming about this little boy gilyeong i love you so damn much i dont know what it is but something about him has just stuck in my heart since the beginning and every reaction with dokja just makes my head spin the big brother vibes are killing mehonestly it‚Äôs messed up that they‚Äôre all so dependent of dokja since he has the food and the coins like damn if yall want some then stop sitting around and get some yourself survival of the fittest and wisest am i right if your kid doesn‚Äôt have enough coins or food stop babying himher and teach them to survive not to depend on othersdude is a true capitalistdokja is such a badassin an apocalypse there could have been no better choiceleshgoo im so glad hes not your typical hero he has his own sense of neutrality nd i love that damn it why is he so hotpeople can hate dokja all they wanti still think hes bae üò©‚ù§Ô∏è‚úãüèΩdamndokja is ‚ú®ÔΩÜÔΩâÔΩéÔΩÖ ‚ú®ah yes this is the type of mc i like üòåy didn‚Äôt he say that guy with the glasses have coin just ask himüòÇhes using like a mythical max level weapon on level villagers i love how people were trying to guilt him using morals and then literally two seconds later tried to kill himomniscient reader is the best thing on this universe i completely understand why he chose to do that if he wouldve chosen to give his coins out most of the people would die anyway and he would‚Äôve wasted coins for no reason leaving him with way less coinsits funny how the same people willing to kill to survive are the same ones that ask for coins to survive like get your crazy ideas that world revolves around you under control dokja aint at fault for the fact u domt have survival fee after all u did was sit on your asses and wait for someone else to take care of youi really like where this is headed so many stories have the main character stick to the typical hero plot which there‚Äôs nothing wrong with because it always makes a good story but i really like how different this is it‚Äôs a way more accurate portrayal of the chaos and the human desire to survive people really wouldn‚Äôt be generous in this scenario it really is a fantastic depiction of survival of the fittestthe reason wednesdays exist omniscient readerdokja just became one of my favourite mcsi like this so much i didn‚Äôt think he was going to kill someone but you got to do what you gotta do and it‚Äôs not some game this is actual survival you already payed for the food so no refunds this is a game of survival and you must think wisely i think everyone can agree it‚Äôs so refreshing to have a character who cares about others but also knows to look after themself first can‚Äôt wait to see how it develops further thank you author keep up the great workdokja‚Äôs character is what‚Äôs lacking in solo leveling limits i rly rly like dokjams character the whole series i believe is a gem that needs to be caressed slowly great job author hope it continues to prosper im a caring person but im siding with dokja they dont see that they allowed this situation and are still being manipulatedwhy do i feel like dojka is going to turn into a nuetural good charactercan i just say that sword is real nice dokja sold food for $ while inho sold his food for more why should dokja be responsible for all these people lifes if he isnt even part of the group if inho the leader shouldnt he be responsible for everyone people can lie about how much coins they actually have people already knew about this coin system early so shouldnt they have been responsible with their moneylook our favorite dokkaebi is backü•∞ü•∞ü•∞its not that he doesnt care at all he just knows that he needs those coins to survive later because he knows the relative future it is his life over others so obviously he has to choose himself no one is going to pay him back laterhyeonseong lee is the type of guy that would never cheat on you üòåanother thing i love about this is that his group stays by him they understand that he doesn‚Äôt owe these people anything and he‚Äôs not a bad person for refusing to give them food and money i‚Äôm glad that they aren‚Äôt falling for any of itdokja has made his way to my top favorite badass manhwa characters sitting at # right behind sung jin woothis doesnt make him evil or even neutral as he points out no one here is good and hes resisting the evil manipulation of the incite powerlook ma no handswhy are people trying to get refunds for the food that they already ate lmao im with dokja you foolshow can they ask for a refund after they have already eaten the foodi stan dokja it‚Äôs not on him to save everyone do you boo boohe really just said dont touch me or my family at the last scenedaammnnn this is the character ive been looking fooorrr oh sweetcheese dokja imma go marry youüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠dokja is smart as hellgosh that kid is quite op oh cool sangah have some useful skill too woah so dokja can now collect information on the target character omg the cute evil dokkaebi bihyeong is back oh so the dokkaebi can use telepathy with dokja thats interesting lol the soldier hyeonsyeong is happy with his shield bruh this annoying guy again yes im waiting for you to make your decision too dokja deym he went full cold psycho thats so awesome he even cut that guys arm off clean im so proud of youit‚Äôs is time ladies and gentlemen this is what i call sweet fucking satisfaction everyone is like oh he doesnt have morals but thats not true his morality is just different in an alignment chart he would be lawful neutral possibly lawful good compared to everyone else he doesnt believe in giving away things for free the people could offer him something and he would probably agree that doesnt make him morallesshonestly dokja‚Äôs character development really resonates with me if i have been put at the edge of my life‚Äôs cliff numerous times hanging on with my teeth i‚Äôd be sick and tired of people‚Äôs shit toooh my‚Äî dokja is so‚Äî jfjdhskfhdjebdjdndj üî• üî• üî• üî• yes yes dokja worked so hard for his coins and he is without any sponsor why should he give them just because they think he shouldnt let them die they killed people without problem to survive the first scenario üôÑwtf he is hero for his friend and villain for others i love it üò±üò±üò± i love this types of character thank god he‚Äôs not like other main characters ü•∫üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è dude he‚Äôs so cool t^t is intrigued by dokjas choicesnnoo i read all the episodes this is one of those ones where they should make into a showyo i think dokja made the right decision it‚Äôs an apocalypse and he has his own to care for plus how many of those people would give up their coins if they were in his situation i‚Äôm pretty sure none of them would üòåit‚Äôs literally the apocalypse you live on by every decision you make and being nice isn‚Äôt going to keep you alive forever dokja did the right thing im honestly in love with dokjas characterdokja in the beginning of the webtoonim not smart or handsomedokja right now is the most attractive character everi smell anti hero development and im here for itüòädokja has shown us he‚Äôs considerate but he‚Äôs not a pushover either when this is your th time reading the comic and it still hasnt gotten oldwell if he would not have sold them food they would be already dead ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èim % with dokja in this why the hell he has to share his coins just because some random dude ask you lmao tbh ill do the same he doesnt have the responsibility for others lifes only for his own survival dokja is one of the best mc ive seen in a while love the line about the killing in the first triallike youre capable of premeditated murder but not to take care of yourself you dont even have to do everything alone you can team up if they didnt just stay in one place roughly % of them would be able to survivehonestly i would have behaved like that too dokja is not selfish just because he isnt being blindly selfless he is strategic because this world is all about survivali love how hes not our typical hero and is a human to be honest if i was in his position i probably wouldnt help them either its a dog eat dog world only the fittest will survive every man for himselfi like how he refuse he earn the coins with hard work and good thinking while those people are desperate to survive but they don‚Äôt think outside of the box like dokia in the first scenariodokja is good and evilyes mess them up do not i repeat do not let this sick ass bastered get away with thisits literally not his fault its like attack a stranger because they didnt want to help you with your problems its your life to deal with dokja is such a refreshing main character i feel like most mains are usually true good or true evil but so far id say hes pretty neutral hes so interesting and unpredictabledick leader hey bro dont you have the most coins everyone communism intensifieshonestly i‚Äôm happy protagonists should focus on their own survival it‚Äôs not realistic to expect someone to sacrifice themselves for a bunch of strangers not to mention ones who have killed innocents to survive forget morality this is spartathanks author how is this comic not popular you need to be appreciated author nice decision he worked hard for those coins those people should‚Äôve worked for coins when they clearly had the chance not leeching of someone else‚Äôs coins it is also not even his fault that they don‚Äôt have coins from not using it wisely so honestly don‚Äôt give me that shit üò§ fuck i love dokja sm i think dokja is doing the right thing even if the other people think he is being selfish in a survival scenario you cant depend on others to save you the incite guy is banking on dokjas morality forcing him to play nice but survival is the goal not being likedariadne was a princess who gave someone theseus or daedalus i think her magical thread for them to escape a labyrinth im a super greek mythology geek so my theory is sangahs constellation might be ariadne or something its funny how they blame dokja for everything like did he forces you to buy the food or what dokja i‚Äôll give you the coins back if you can undigest all that food you bought from mehe handled that nicelyits funny how similar this is to real capitalism people always seem to demonize people with money because there are needy out there and thus try to take their money through various means just a connection my brain madeoh shi turned him into overhaul ü§£ü§£pacifism is a point of weakness in a world where everyone has already killedive never bought any coins or tried to on this app but this story not only made to buy and look for coins but also the only one for which i use all those coins and thats saying something no sorry a lotttbtw i just love dokjas character the right balance of good and evil he knows when to be good and when not to be he doesnt follow common guide lines or general society morals which are dubious at times like thesei read it in the novel but i still get irritated and upset with this scene kim dokja may sound selfish but everyone else needs to be responsible for their own lives giving them fish for today wont help them tomorrow ironically i have ran out of coins so now i have to waitthe constellation the reader of a thousand webtoons gives dokja a bro fist of approvalare you jeanhenri fabre or something bahahahahahaha amazing üòÇaslal is really interested in every decision dokja make she has become a fan of yours here‚Äôs your five coin bro we all just people spending money to read will we all heard this qoute if you make this a game ill show you how its played thats how exactly how he manage to not keep going to his game plan i love it and im still willing to waste more coinsstrong escanor vibes^¬∞^well at least this webtoon is close to reality in terms of attitudeim done with hypocrite characters so always have those high values that sometimes it doesnt feel real at all i cannot express how much i love protagonists like dojka a person‚Äôs bound to get tired of mary sues at some point üòîi love moral grey points in post apocalypse i hate seeing the goody twoshoes in these situations its literally kill or be killed everyone there has taken a life so they dont deserve true sympathyall yall getting heated in the comments coz dokja aint fit your standards of high morality theyre all murderes lmao dokja raised a very good point on ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt even take responsibility for their own lives‚Äù so why would dokja be responsible for their lives‚Ä¶ yes it would be kind and generous of dokja if he‚Äôs willing to give it to them for free but for him this is survival of the fittest and he earned those big money because of his smart thinkingstrategy he has the right to refuse as selfish and cruel as it sounds them trying to leech on him forcibly and badmouthing him when they aren‚Äôt even‚Äî‚Äîbe nice and give these murderers you dont even know some of your life line and risk you and your own groups safety and survival to make these people who just sit in a corner till someone comes whom they can leech off on survive hours then leech off on you again next time cuz youre nice yeah sure no shtpff to be completely honest i wouldve been worse in dokjas situation like i dont know why i should save them i dont mind being called the villain i just protect those people i value and im not about to risk nor sacrifice the chances of our survival to murderers i barely knowi love it when the mc is neither a hero or a villainbro wjy is he so hotim beginning to like this man i think i‚Äôm in love right now i would just mention that this fella right here killed a demon and got coins as reward so one of your men now has enough coins to save everyone sheesshhh mah guy turn to erenok but bihyeong was so cute in that one panel xddhe watched his own hands wave him goodbye üëãüèª üòÇüòÇü§£üòÇi might sound wicked but i really liked how he reacted üòàim still not done reading the novel but dang i love dokjas character so much but once again none of these people tried to hunt monsters and complete the task like bruh theyre just a bunch of leeches and the spirit said that coins will be drawn daily even if they had it for the night they wouldnt have any for the next night and they still wouldnt try to go kill monstersrn my favorite constellation is prisoner of the golden headbandthat moment when u are done playing the good guy routethis is definitely an interesting scenario nice to see bihyeong again toochaotic neutral lol well hes not evil bc all of these people are murderers too lol even worse theyre entitled ones who did it wo thinking in the first tasküò¨dokja is really right i mean they taken someone elses life for their survival and now they arent ready with their life to be taken thats so ridiculous lol dokjas a chaotic neutral typehe is being realistic tho im sick of mc who is always trying to be goody two shoes its an apocalypse who tf in their right mind would want to help others lets be reali think dokja is a complex morally grey character i like those typesam i the only one having a deja vu of kirito from saoits their fault that they dont have coins leeching off of other people and then blaming a guy who worked hard for his coins no thanks üôÑü§öüèºtheyre just pretending to have a high morality high morality yet illogical üôÑ buzzing excuses without even thinking justice should be served who cares about morality when it‚Äôs about your survival feels good to see a mc that doesn‚Äôt want to be a hero all the time‚Äúi want a refund‚Äù bruh you‚Äôre saying you want to uneat food you yourself had chosen to survive by tf lmaomorally grey characters are the most interesting imo im interested to see how dokjas personality and choices influence the original storygod mode has been activated that dude deserved it tbh that sword just cut through flesh ligaments veins and fricking bones in just one clean slice thats literally impossible its an upswing toohyeongsong lee is so üòçüòçüòçdamnnn dokja is seeming to be more malevolent now even the art is making him look evil wonder if his allies will keep supporting him though they didnt seem like theyd want to share their coins either sangah seems reminiscent of ariadne from the greek myths so im wondering where shell stand tooeven the constellations were speechless üò≥holy shit this is so refreshingdokjas principles üò≤üò≤üò≤‚óã‚óã that was hotwow i think hes going to be an anti hero i love how he cut off that guys arms with hesitation these peoples hypocrisy is just so real to me if ever this apocalypse happens the audacity to be guilt tripping someone to greed over their lives when that persons already trying to survive himself too you have been gifted coinsi just like how much he fking loves his new shield yes an mc that doesn‚Äôt stick to the morals ‚Äòhelp everyone‚Äô also they know what theyre doing with the cliffhangers lmaoaoaogive me your hard earned coins so i can survive i dont deserve to die did you kill another human being to get here um yes then screw off üëçüèªbrohe arms wentyeet üíÄthese people are the most unreliable if he helped them now then later they would probably betray him when the odds are against him dokja is seriously my number character and development i agree damn well with his choices i would do the same its the apocalypse not a guy begging on the street i dont mean that rudely btwi love this because he just stick to surviving that‚Äôs all sure he may be doing some wrongs but also some right he is more balance if anything i dig dokja hes more in a grey area instead of being a goodytwoshoes a lot of protagonist with his powers and knowledge would use them too much and create more problems for themselves im glad a lot of webtoons seems to promote this kind of less predictable protagonistdokjas face expressions coupled with his black shirt was really hot dokja is against communism dokja isnt a hero nor is he a villain hes a survivor doing whatever it takes to live and give the people he cares about the opportunity to survive without taking care of themyou know what i think he is making the right decision its there fault for being greedyüòí love the twist btwüíóafter reading this comic my eyes are still shining from excitement ü§© think about it those people are getting what they deservedokja is the most fair of all them it may seem a little too drastic but giving that people coins would be like giving thousands of money to murderers bc of the first scenario im so happy there is finally a character that dont care about what the others think that is fair and trust on their own point of viewdokjamy guyi simp for youi just wanted you to knowi definitely love dokja being a real one giving coins to everyone doesn‚Äôt help anybody what a masterpiece of a webtoon üò©the last panel was literal fire dokjas squad are preparing to destroy those idiotsthis webtoon is so much like the novel such a loyal recreation so fardokja nah frick you i have excaliburthey paid him fairly for food and get mad that he stole his money he just went and got food like any of them couldvethe constellation webtoon fangirl is very intrigued i‚Äôm curious to see how dokja‚Äôs party thinks of this them ppl thought dokja was pussy üòÇüòÇüòÇ the entitlement of all of them as if he had to help them because why to be a good person please they all sat around on their asses instead of trying to fend for themselves and expect him to give out his resources he earned for free byeee aint his fault since he didnt force you guys to buy the foodshit i love this webtoon i think im addicted to iti like dokjas thinking all those people literally killed other people to make it this far but now act like their the victims at the hands of his mercy if they were ready to kill other people for survival they are responsible for their own survival as well its also unlikely for them to survive anyway if they dont stop to rely on other people and they literally had the choice to either try finishing the scenario or die because of lack of coins the first might have even provided some coinshonestly what are they gonna do to him if he doesnt share in a matter of minutes theyll all be dead anyways soi love his character its real who would want to share his live freely with someone he didnt know survival of the fittest bitch you adapt or you die üò±üò±üò± me likey üòè and thats how this became my favorite webtooni love that do you have a death wish or something look at the end üëådokja doesnt have time for your bs dude here i am the person who read the novel patiently waiting to see kyrgioschaotic neutralwait until you see what he become in the futurewhat i find interesting is that these people who are themselves killers trying to hold dokja to a moral high ground like bishyup inho needs to see he ain‚Äôt the boss and the people need to see that inho has been mooching off of them parents with little kids children women have it rough in scenarios like these but even dokja knows that he needs to cull thieving menaces to be of real help and that dude that got violated by a demon seems to not have learned his lesson either the point is that all the people in this scenario are murders they have killed someone to be in this scenario for them to be asking for coins as if it is the moral thing to do is ridiculous it depends on who actually deserves to be helped sangahs ability reminds me of the legend of theseus and the minotaurim glad the main character is basically saying fck you im tryna survive too aint no charity in these streets this is just life the rich people dont hand out money we work for our coinsi think his point is justifiable he straight up asked why do you deserve his coins prove it get them this is the apocalypse being friends wouldnt help you survive for long üòåto be honest dokja is the type of person who is alone but when it comes to lifethreatening situations he would do anything and help anyone if it benefits him as well the type of people dokja is helping are the type to giveandtake they are all compatible in there small group that dokja made they help each other out on the other hand inho cheon who dont give any fs and use other people i would also like to see inho cheon face when that man hands got cut of by dokjaalso dokja legit is getting food and this is what they do the respect he might point out that the got who killed the monster has coins and that the guy leading them didnt seem worried so he must have plenty of coins to sparedear santa please give me coins so i can read the next chapter i promise ill be good remember people to heart this chapter lets appreciate the characters uniqueness ‚ù§Ô∏èkillin old ladies one moment and begging for mercy the next naaww bruhs im good ah chaotic good i am familiar them give us our coins back dokja ¬Ø\\_„ÉÑ_¬Ø survival of the fittest ¬Ø\\_„ÉÑ_¬Ødokja is looking out for his newly formed family notice how he was telling his new kid brother not to use his ability until he tells him to or how he lets the girl know not to tell anybody about her contract or how he got a shield for his buddy it seems to me hes looking out not just for himself but his friends oh and love the back and forth with the dokabilmao i just realized something coins are the most powerful thing in that world and this is the same for us people who have enough coins can fastpass while us peasants are left to die in boredom and impatience lewlthe moral high ground has no meaning when the first thing you had to do to survive was take another lifehe just had enough of your shitthank you for the realism when your life‚Äôs at stake there‚Äôs no time for a moral high ground‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èhelp me i have a serious thing for dokjai feel like you could never stick to a moral high ground in an apocalyptic universe people are gonna die and you want to survive what you have to do to survive may not he the most morally good thing to do but thats lifei like dokja‚Äôs way of thinking it‚Äôs not the typical ‚Äúhero‚Äù personality that he‚Äôs got but at least he thinks rationally depending on the situation they are in stan dokja üõêdid they think theyd survive if it werent for dokja giving them the food what do they think is dokja to them their nanny ofc hes gonna ask you to pay for shit nothing is free in this world nothing i really do love dokjas character to death hes not the usual annoyingly good guy mc and even the protagonist of the story isnt nice theyre human and it shows i love how much this webtoon shows the flaws of us living beings i also would do the same thing hes smart cunning and selfish plus he tells it how it is like why should i give up my coins for yall when that has nothing to do with me he reminds me of myself and i love iti think dokja is a good person he does help people when he can like heewon but theres a line between nice and stupidty he cant just sacrifice himself for everyone else in such an insane world it really forces your true self out of you i like how this mc isnt just gonna blindly follow we must help others sharing is caring~ like many other mcs do another example of an mc i think is similar to dokja in the above stated manner is medea from your throne dokja sure is one hell of an interesting character huhi love how realistic kind of dokja is i mean his personalitydokja had to risk his life in many situations in order to earn that many coins it‚Äôs his right to keep those coins to himself instead of giving it to people that sat around in a safe zone waiting for coins and food while others went out and risked their lives for coins and food ü§∑okay but seriously how many of them killed to survive the first round only thise who didnt deserve it and honestly survival of the fittest and his friends he and his crew went out and earned those coins they didnt kill a single person eitheridk why people think the protag is evil in the first game he saved the child when he had no reason to and he also saved the woman from the poison when yet again he had no reason to it just so happens that they were useful the child was not in the webtoon that he was reading and the woman was but he had no idea who she wasim just waiting for the constellation secretive plotter to reveal that heshe is the author of twsano shits were givenbro what abt the suit guy he has like coinsthe ad i got at the end of this episode just so happened to be a snickers adself defence moral high ground they took lives why should he save theirs i dunno still pretty high morals and he attacked only when his life was in danger ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it‚Äôs not all so black and whitedealing with people is exhausting irl and even in apocalypseare we just gonna ignore hyeongseong lee being adorable after polishing his shieldright if you need coins get them for yourself dokja literally fights everytime while the others just wait for food and coins its an apocalypse i dont like it morally but i do agree with him since he did earn the coins and this is life or death he cant rlly be charitable in this kind of situation yep im addicted ddokja was like nah this an apocalypse not a charity üò®üò®üò® dokja sometimes is really scary i want a refund huh lol ok karen i want a refund when you ask for a refund you gotta bring back what you bought no then give the food back oh you cant not his problemdude theres literally a survival fee for everyday say dojka gave away all these coins for the people ok and then what he cant do this everyday so theyre going to die anyway like bruh hes not even being evil i played way too much etrian odyssey to not recognize an ariadne thread when i see one üòÇooh what a powerful boy we got therei love grey charactersthat army guy is so cute when he wipe that shield üòÜüòÜüòÜskfjfjsjfjj why am i so into the whole morally grey mc trope üò© especially when they got that iq üëåü§å like medea muah chefs kissthings have gotten so interesting i misread have you all been well and saw it have you all been in hellluke skywalker would be proud i love me some psychological warfarethis is survival anything goes if only you hadnt bought excessively then none of this wouldve happened he may look like hes making heartless decisions but its simply survivallol our favorite doakabi is backi mean even if he went full on humanitarian and gave away every single scrap he still couldn‚Äôt save everyone in rescue training they teach you never to put yourself in a position of unnecessary risk bc you‚Äôll just increase the number of people needing rescuedsame idea here some degree of selfishness required im satisfied with dokjas decisionmorally grey characters are my weaknesswhy isnt anyone talking about bihyeong he was hilarious and adorable that wink and that totally innocent whistlingso chaotic neutral character niceother readers i love this doods attitude me yay bihyeongs backa character with common sense and isnt an asshole im hooked now dokja is so badass im here for itbruh the kid in the back is lookin just as evil as dokja he like mfer deserved it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èim kind of happy a little sad that some kids will die but these people cant seem to understand that this world now revolves in a different way and dokja will ride the wavesim glad that dokja didnt give infck that dumb face inho i wannaüòíüëä himi love how this dude really keeps targeting dokjahe doesnt even help them out himself just using their misfortune to manipulate them no more kind dokjai like how dokja has gone from ‚Äúi am a normal person‚Äù to ‚Äúi am a super genius‚Äù to ‚Äúwhy should i give a shit if you live or die‚Äù over the course of ~ chaptersin a situation where you dont need morals to survive i like that attitudehehhes so hot god i need a minutethe look in his eye is crazy and i love itcheckmate communists yesyesyes yes kill them alli love it when the mc turns evilooo goddamn dokja is becoming a morally grey character someone who isn‚Äôt good but not baddokja is my new religion üßé‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èhonestly i get it why sacrifice for people who leech off of you and kill you the first chance they get the best thing to do while they still had plenty time wouldve been to try to fulfil the scenario with the strongest leading the charge or with inho inspiring the others but unfortunately those in charge are selfish cowards im glad he chooses to be selfish cause for what reason he wanna give them the coins in this time you should save yourself first before save other people yay the little crazy creature is bk and l love dokia face is like a crazy person laughing to himselfthis webtoon is awesome the main character is very progressive and hyper aware of the situation i love it hey uh dokja got cake all these people survived by murdering someone if anything they shouldn‚Äôt even talk about sharing and having morals i think dokja‚Äôs decisions are right i think morally he is doing the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing to survive what about what‚Äôs his face that received coins for finishing off the demon couldn‚Äôt he sharei love how dokja thinks fck morals be smart this is why i love antihero main characters am i the only one who laughed when the guy looked back at his falling armsüëÄ it was funny to me im not sadistic tho lolif this was real life than id probably have to think about my personal morals and the situation a bit before siding with dokja but since this is fiction im satisfied as hell with whats happening right now go dokja dugh man i read it to fast now i have to waitüòÖüò¢ooh yes i love dokja hes one of the best characters ive seen in webtoon so fareveryones gonna forget that coins that evil rich dude got for slaying the monsterwould have been funny if he said that the annoying ex workmate had just won coins just wondering what would have happened then p holy fudge this is the mc that ive been looking forthis has nothing to do with the webtoon but long live the demon kinghe‚Äôs not rude he‚Äôs just being smart all these ppl would never give him if they hadperiod they would never and we all know that so ya why would he dokja is the one character whos neither too kind and good to be true neither evil and ruthless hes smart and wise its so refreshing to see such a character and well ofc hes climbing up the d best list too quicklyomg make this an animeawooga bark bark grryesss love a good chaotic neutral character i wonder what the backstory of that kid did since the first scenario is to kill an organism i wonder if he killed a person or something else the kid as in one of the woman‚Äôs kidi love it when my main characters go chaotic neutraldid anyone notice huwons traits is about to blossom hope she doesn‚Äôt become a mass murder like dokja said she mightplease make this an animei like how the authors made clear dokja its not a piece of cake by making him cut both arms of the thug at once no joking aroundi love this i cant even writehe went from zero to badass in secondsill call it as a realistic smart and pratical good character dokja is the epitome of true neutral im really curious to see how his friends are going to react for him doing that in a survival speaking it was a really good choice if your point in that time is to survive then morals and feelings are useless however in a human way of seeing this situation no matter what you tell yourself there is this feeling of morality that tells you what he did was wrong to those persons who are just trying to live and you shouldnt be with him so it becomes a huge psychological conflictdokjas perfect retaliation this is why its one of the top webtoonsthey all asked so nicely for the coins and food before but when hes finally being a little selfish because there his coins they all just try to kill him like dude he gave away all of his food and risked his life to find more and this is what they resort to loloriginal sin i think it refers to the deadly sin pride inho the b@st@rd lust the guys that tryna rape girls by luring them back in the early ep greed them hovering over dokjas food and money sloth them be just sittin there waiting for food wrath inho and the people attacking dokja envy cursed dude envying dokja for its achievements gluttony idkyeah this decision seems logical to me ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏ènew world new rules even on normal world there is no good people and evil people there is survival your mind own sense od justicethis webtoon is a war between my ‚Äúwork together to survive‚Äù mentality vs my ‚Äúgive no shits cause they don‚Äôt deserve it‚Äù mentality it‚Äôs getting so fucking goodour coins what i find funny is how they all say they want a refund but they already ate all the fooddokja really said f in the chat to the people who cant pay for it üëÅüëÑüëÅi want dojak to turn the tables besides none of this fee stuff would have happened if greedie boy over there didnt stockpile foodlove when main characters go semi dark in these situationsi really shouldn‚Äôt be laughing this hard üòÇ dokja really is the definition of true neutraldojka in the last panel left me with shivers down my spinei would have turned it around i would have said okay but only if you and your group redistribute your own coins first lets see your status screen and the other search party members and have you pay off as much as possible then i can pay the remainder that should be fair since i havent officially joined this group yet and have been attacked twice already dont delay too long of you want everyone to surviveim eagerly waiting for the next episode dokja is not a hero known for his heart of gold and his bravery hes just another player with a distinct advantage he has intricate knowledge of the game world and he has to use that knowledge wisely im sure he doesnt want people to die but theres no point in killing himself for them so early in the game he might give them a chance if he deems them worthy of joining his party but thats about it dokja is so freaking cool because he is not one of those goodygoody always do whats right and angelic and kind at your own expense kind of character but he is not just a straight up kill everyone and make explosions for no reason but to cause suffering kind of character either it is so amazing and i love itit was the people decision to buy the food in the first place then they crazy cause they don‚Äôt have the coins to survive anymore tough luck man ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èi think dokja is chaotic neutralhe did the right decision i would of done the same or just not returnyou see those mental gymnastics right there first they blame dokja for all their problems then they expect him to fix their problems and then expect him to just sit their and let them jump him hilarious hahaha the fine line between morality vs justice it may not be morally right to not help those people but they put themselves in that position so it would be unjust to dokja if he were to selflessly sacrifice what he had earned himself it‚Äôs all oh so sweet gotta love dokja my man üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºit isnt morality its justice what have they done to deserve the coins its just stupid the next time they need to pay the fee they wont have any coins because there aren t helping nor going out for supplies btw black shorted hair girl is waifu uwui was getting tired of him playing along for the love of god its the fcking apocalypsei really like this character development unlike other main characters this make apocalypses more realistic i hope dokja knock some sense into those people against inho or even themselves they let themselves get into a position where inhos group has power over them it may not be the best decision for dokja but it may have been a wise oneyes finally an mc in dealing with these kind of scenarios the way i want them too no more playing the hero and saving people who dont need to be saved or will just flip on you at the drop of a dime my god the adrenaline kick from this episode love it anyway i really hope this gang stays as allies üòåüòåhm so dokja is a gray characteri üëèüèΩ dont üëèüèΩhave üëèüèΩmoney üëèüèΩ so üëèüèΩ ill üëèüèΩ wait üëèüèΩ lmao üò≠ this webtoon is a dopethose peopleare so stupid really he worked hard for it and its not his fault that they didnt get to eat bc it got confiscated and also they didnt huntthey cant just stick or think someone will do things for them to survivethen they have the audacity to ask for coins when all they do is complain best mc everof course those people deserve coins but if they‚Äôre all clamoring and running up towards him violently he can‚Äôt give them to anyone since he doesn‚Äôt even have enough coins in addition they are only thinking of themselves when doing this trying to attack him saying that he needs to give them coins because they need them more than him because it‚Äôs evil to do otherwise they act out of selfishness so why can‚Äôt dokja act out of selfishness too this is the apocalypse i badly want an animation of this webtoon i know it will and i cant for itü§ßü§ßdokja is right all of these people killed someone else to clear the first scenario now why they are asking him for help thats not how you survive fellas you go dokja as long as he is not betraying anyone he is finebihyeong in the background looking adorable and secretly chatting with dokja is precious best thing ever bihyeong is my fave even though hes a cosmic being that basically runs a torture channel ruining lives and hes not actually like a good guy i guess but whatevs he fictional and sometimes lovelyi think he just wants to see who attacks him and help out the restthe satisfaction when undeserving people dont get what they want üò≥personal attribute of a badassits nice to have a main character who thinks rationally and makes the right decision i love reading his thoughts because they analyze the situations clearly if they cant take care of their own lives what right did they have to take others anyways even if he gave them coins today they will ask for more tomorrowthis is basically equity vs equality should we all receive the same or should we all achieve the same levelyes thats exactly what i wanted to see this webtoon just climbed up the ranks of my top with a gigantic leapeveryone who is saying dokja is gonna be a bad character kind of person i will say these are his survival tactics if he just agrees to everything other people say then whats the profit in reading twsa he needs to be one of the protagonist that i feelit feels to me like dokja is going to walk a weird sort of moral grey area and apply pressure on both sides to survive i like thisok but suit man has like k coins someone let them knowwhy does he let blond main group leader live he kills for lessthis is totally interesting survival story where moral ground is in conflict with survival of the charactersfinally tbh i would of been done killed someone bro like fr idc let me be the villain that is full and is rich off coins i earned my fair share should of read the book sucks to suck tell on the so called leader that bastardit would have been seriously idiotic if dokja had chosen otherwise usually all the protagonists try to be heroic and hold on to their morals and stuff with the stupid self sacrificing personality but dokja is straightforward legendary and his face in that panel why should i give you any was so badass it‚Äôs nice to have heroes that act selfish once in a while it‚Äôs quite refreshing to see the people‚Äôs faces like ‚Äúwhat but we wasted our money on your food refund‚Äù i‚Äôm like ‚Äúbruh if you can‚Äôt return the food in one edible piece why should he give back the coins‚Äùyou dont care about him so why would he care about you üòíohohohohohoits not censoreddokja keeps showing traits of maybe why his destiny chose him to hold more power in the times of apocalypse people deserve love mercy and sharing to prosper together but dokja also knows how to find the true deserving ones when you go to attack someone you should expect them to fight back he has more coins than all of you for a reasonnow this is what a protagonist should bewell frick why does dokja have to be so hot and cool help me pls somebodyyou don‚Äôt need to set yourself on fire to keep other people warm greedy people just take and take there‚Äôs no end to it one day it‚Äôs this another it‚Äôs that i‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs not giving in it‚Äôs rare to see a main character not maintain morals this series is so original and well written and honestly i hope it gets its own animeme who needs coins to feed the next episodewhen u try to roleplay a true neutral pc on dungeons and dragonsfinally a main character who isn‚Äôt always niceoh i like him more and more why should dokja share his coins if they didnt even earn them everyone literally wants everything for free and its patheticyess a protagonist makes a practical decision he looks dead on the insidehe literally disarmed that guythis was a ratherdisarming episodethread and labyrinth huh i think her sponsor is a greek mythdokja yesss you will not be fooled by that evil manokay but why is the dokkaebi so cutethis webtoon is so amazing i do not regret fast passing lee hyeonseong lee hyunsung whatever spelling your name is lmao you precious bean i wanna protect you with my life i wanna wrap you in a blanket and sing you lullabies this webtoon always makes me coins spendin and im not regretting it aahhh this nigga rawdokja gives a lesson stand up for urself u always gonna be kind to everyone then u gonna get urself killed limit ur kindness ^_^the fact that i have to wait is killing me but this is now my new favorite series fast pass isnt fast enough if you reached the last available episode üòêi like how dokja is a true neutral character not a protagonist but also not a villain he doesn‚Äôt hurt or help anybody he doesn‚Äôt have to with exceptions lol and i am excited to see where his character development goes from here finally i feel bad for the guy who got his arm cut off but damn that is one effective way to settle a crowd and get them to listen real quick even if only for a minute it could make all the difference is this man just going to straight up murder the leader damn i hope sovote dokja for most savage man of not even someone just spare me more coins i promise ill pay you back just more to make it to the next scenariowelp now i‚Äôm officially going bankrupt thank you webtoonssharin ain‚Äôt carin in üò∑excited to see a well written anti hero these are so hard to cone by these daysi see dokja being a grey area character not necessarily evil but not good either hes just true neutral people kill the man who survived the subway dokja deletes a mans arms please do continue to try if you want to diethat‚Äôs insane he‚Äôs giving out coins in trade for handsi love dokjathis is not a handy situation its all out of hand and in the palm of chaos but this story is finger licking goodcame to comment on how much i like having a neutral main character but so did everyone else üòÇoh boy he‚Äôs not playing around anymorewhy cant they release two chapters a day they got me fcked up having to wait üëÄüò°üò° also i love homegirl that asked for the sword lol bish has no chill and i love it she is def gun be a bad ass character ‚úäüèΩüëäüèΩüí¢thatll be me when i stop acting nice to everyone and smilingdokja is right why would he give his coins for them if he gave his coins they will just be thankful at first but the system will collect coins and the cycle will repeat again its % waste he dont even know or owe them theyre parasites and you wouldnt want parasites stick on you and extract all you have until you have nonei‚Äôm not gonna put dokja on a pedestal for cutting the guy‚Äôs forearms off but i will say this is getting pretty interesting slayyy dokja as you shouldhe always think logically i love his characterim so addicted to this webtoonwhat high morality and shit dokja collected all those coins himself he risked his life to get the foods too if anything its those leechesthat went from please give us some of your coins~ to kill him and get his coins from him real quickdokja is just keeping it if they wanted to live they couldve gone out and put the work in instead following a prick who just talks all the damn time dokja earned his coins he owes nothingwhy do they want a refund i mean they bought it and ate itüíÄi mean think about it what would happen in the long run its just like that saying you can give a man a fish but you can teach how to fish and hell fish for the rest of his life its not exactly like that but in the future they wont have enough coins either and he cant just keep giving them coins that will get him killedyk i love it when characters drop the good deeds and decide that they dont wanna deal with any of the bs hes also got a point as well and yeah majority of the people were asses anyway who killed to survive in the first scenario but now theyre all going up to dokja and beg him for coins and shit im excited to see where this is going and him slicing the dudes arms man ive never been so satisfiedreally love dokja so much sick and tired of mcs who are like ‚Äúohhh yeah i‚Äôm a good guy lets share some shit‚Äù he is like nah bitches not happening lmaodokja believes in justice so hes right to ask why if u have bad intentions why should he helphes so hotthis is why i love dokja ü§£‚ù§Ô∏èif its not just me but why do i feel like dokja is not normal either‚Ä¶ from the start where he instantly knew how to use his bookmark and hi calm demeanor while facing people deaths its not normal it feels like he knows something but i couldn‚Äôt explainoh yey ~ theres a difference to logic and morality thats why philosophers always grind their brains with ethics coz they have different values and principles with survival as the main objective being charitable kills even the recipients not just the giverbihyung is back lol but he looks so cuteeven im scared and pleased to his decision its just so good that the author makes the plot twist excitingdokjas decision was realistic idk the right term for that bcs i mean they are all fighting for survival being righteous and kind would actually bring them nowhere or something like that dang i should work on my vocabularyomg im so in love with his attitudethat last panel chillsmc so bad assthis is refreshinghyeongseong is a big softiehahah i like how his arms got chopped off they are saying that he is a bad guy but all of the survivors are bad people for what they have done so they shouldnt even say a person is bad because their is no good peopledokja lookin hot there wtfam i the only one who missed the dokkaebi and thinks its cuteno just me okayüòëok damn that was hothes kinda like a prantagonisti would have just murdered anyone who tried to take the coins no moral high ground in this universe screw you inhothey want to get coins easier than accomplishing the scenariosthe best way to describe dokja is dark heror thought their methods are cruel they always do whats justicethis is exactly what i expected him to do in the previous episode people should learn not to blame others for their errors eren likethis is actually a depiction of the sad reality people will blame you for their own misfortune they will ask you things and if you wont give it to them they will blame you for the things they couldnt attain bc of the loss of that something when in fact they couldve made a way to get that something dokja is so hot grrokay look if he gave them coins just for free like he‚Äôs not getting anything in return free he‚Äôs giving them a free pass they will end up just sitting there with their hands outreached waiting for you to put the next thing in their palm they have to earn it even now you have to work for everything so like they‚Äôre not just gonna be given a free pass even the child was like ‚Äúim not gonna be useless‚Äù and got skills to help and actually helped that‚Äôs not a lack of morals or empathy disarming a grunt with ] has taken and is impressed with the hard decision] i wonder if he could have gained any traction by mentioning the incite ability people hate being manipulated once they know then again that would probably be showing his hand too muchantiheroduhyeah like they killed another person to save themselves and now they want him to save them without any profitwhy should heüòèwhat about the dude with over coins did he diemama got a point though it‚Äôs not his fault you‚Äôre there ü§îokay but why did he seemed so hot like i can‚Äôt handle one more fictional crushthings are about to get interesting uhonestly they don‚Äôt have any right to make others stick to morality if they themselves have thrown theirs away also that inciteful fellow is annoying too and i‚Äôm excited to see the tables turndamn i just started reading this for just coins but its so addicting lolhe is starting to get the dripi just want someone to look at me like the tank is looking at his shield maybe its just me trying to justify it but i think when he said something to the effect of they all took a life but couldnt take responsibility for their own he knew most of these people didnt even look for an alternative theyre people who wouldnt help him were their positions reversed not after consideration consciously just out of pure cowardice the way people make excuses not to help others every day when theyre easily in a position todokkaebi communication you mean when you and your friend are in the same room texting each otherre reading this was worth it ahh my cute bihyeong is backkküò≠‚ô•Ô∏èto be fair he never has stuck to a moral high ground not in the slightest he has been doing everything as if he wasn‚Äôt actually in the situation himself he is doing everything in order to make the constellations want to pay attention to him fulfilling his end of his contractcame here to get free coins and got a nice webtoon to read winwin situation at its bestüåüthis hole coin situation is kinda funny when i realize im reading this for free coins in the app these idiots they were the ones who were going to steal food from dokja and now their mad because he gave it to themdude dokja tho üî•üî•üî•üî• get em for some reason my brain sometimes automatically reads dokja as doja cat thank u he same situation happened to me obviously not as dangerous but still i was playing and online game and i traded stuff for a rare item and the next day the girl wanted it back i was like no it was a fair trade if u wanted to keep ur items then dont trade theminteresting a john henry fabre reference i highly recommend his book on entomological science the insect world its such a fun book üòùaye why is that mf mr han siding with the other guy after all that hardship dokja went through to save him üòídamn hes so badass üò©give me some dokkaebi plushie pleasegilyeong lools like the child of dojka and the brown haired woman that has the same colored has as gilyeong sorry if im spwlling it wrongoohh im excited to see where this goes love the change of his mood humans are so pathetic just blaming someone else always he giving off that bad bitch energy i love this story so damm much ughthat last pannel scares the hell outta medokja is about to be the ultimate grey area lolllfkki like this side mci think dokja is doing the right thing if you want to survive an apocalypse you don‚Äôt really try to protect everyone around you this isn‚Äôt a game it‚Äôs life survival of the fittest my dudesfrankly when trying to survive you can only look after yourself and your loved ones in good times or bad you can share what you can but if i had myself to look after i would be the same and im a really giving person you gotta be smart and dokja isso glad the mc isn‚Äôt a generic trash that tries to have a moral high groundi fucking love dokja hes one of the best mc out there he sees no need in having a high moral ground its a damn apocalypsei literally love this character its ok to be badüòài like how both dokja and the station ppl are to blame for their situation right now the reason theyve run out of coins is bc they gave it to dokja and now everyone is pointing fingers at him its a kindness of dokja to even think of sharing his food to them this webtoon is just amazing cant wait to read more‡≤†–¥‡≤†Ôªøyeeaahh lets goi meani would‚Äôve done the sameüò∂like dude you ain‚Äôt gonna remember me tomorrow for what i do today when you were already up with a rod to kill me nowü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èive decided since im a six foot six giant in real life my constellation will be named giant of moralityi‚Äôm enjoying the fact dokja isn‚Äôt falling for that guys manipulative ways so muchh a little too much if i may addwhy didnt the mc just say that the glasses guy has more coins than him like glasses guy literally has kyes pop off on em dokjadojka is a good character its the others who are bad and i see alot of people saying dojka is being bad and its cool yes hes not helping others whore not even trying he did help them earlier by giving them food for a cost money is a convenient tool for people and theyve just relied on it anyways like he said the first scenario was themed on original sin so it makes sense for everyone else to be sinfulsome people here really makes me wanna slap my phonevery interesting strokes nonexistent beardi think were entering the corruption arc ü§îi love the mc so much holy shti‚Äôm glad he isn‚Äôt sticking to the moral high ground because i‚Äôm sure that guy that‚Äôs using incite would just use dokja until he was completely worn down it‚Äôs probably why the other protagonist left the subway immediately as well if he gives k coins today then he‚Äôd have to give money again tomorrow and the next day because this group is just sitting arounddamn mc badass level skyrocketed from to a freaking but thats kinda cruel honestly i dont know what id do in this situation üòÖüòÖüòÖokay cause dokja was definitely justified in doing that all of these people have no problem turning on him if they had the opportunity so don‚Äôt bring this moral crap on him nothing is free you need to work for these things so accept your fate or try to change and earn those damn coinsi really like the original sin dynamic herenow heres a character i can relate to honestly im sick of characters who always stick to the white side in a gray world theres no black and white really love dokjasht just went from to real quickdamn the kids power is strong never expected him to be able to connect to a monster that size early on i really like this development most mcs are just annoying talking about good and bad actually its all greyüêß cant wait until dokja thrown a stone at zeus i will have to wait years to see thathyeonsong is the cutest baby big boy im glad hes not all self righteous and shitlet‚Äôs goo dokja supremacy dokja won‚Äôt suck up to hypocrites this is the kind of mc i want cause in his world no one is fug releated to you they just leave you alone when you need them üòàüòàüòàbihyeong being cute hahahaha you little wicked patootiey‚Äôall i bet secret plotter is the guy who wrote the book he read i‚Äôm glad he isn‚Äôt sticking to the moral high ground because i‚Äôm sure that guy that‚Äôs using incite would just use dokja until he was completely worn down it‚Äôs probably why the other protagonist left the subway immediately as well if he gives k coins today then he‚Äôd have to give money again tomorrow and the next day because this group is just sitting arounddamn mc badass level skyrocketed from to a freaking but thats kinda cruel honestly i dont know what id do in this situation üòÖüòÖüòÖokay cause dokja was definitely justified in doing that all of these people have no problem turning on him if they had the opportunity so don‚Äôt bring this moral crap on him nothing is free you need to work for these things so accept your fate or try to change and earn those damn coinsi really like the original sin dynamic herenow heres a character i can relate to honestly im sick of characters who always stick to the white side in a gray world theres no black and white really love dokjasht just went from to real quickdamn the kids power is strong never expected him to be able to connect to a monster that size early on i really like this development most mcs are just annoying talking about good and bad actually its all greyüêß cant wait until dokja thrown a stone at zeus i will have to wait years to see thathyeonsong is the cutest baby big boy im glad hes not all self righteous and shitlet‚Äôs goo dokja supremacy dokja won‚Äôt suck up to hypocrites this is the kind of mc i want cause in his world no one is fug releated to you they just leave you alone when you need them üòàüòàüòàbihyeong being cute hahahaha you little wicked patootiey‚Äôall i bet secret plotter is the guy who wrote the book he read yeah when im in an apocalyptic world i hope i find someone like him and end up in their party lmao why didnt he say that out loud you know that part where he said that they took someone else‚Äôs life and cant take care of their own like thats factsü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èwho else hopes this will be adapted into an anime in the near futureim crying from pure fucking happiness i cant belive how good this is bringing back memories from when i read the novell t^tguys remember to like the chapterim laughing cause the regular main characters be like we need to uphold the moral standpoint and share while dokja just be like pay up btches~ i dont fcking care if you die only me and my friends can survive for almost free~ like oh my god~ xd he is like an anti hero or like one of those people you think are more logical than moralsome villains but are actually the main characteraka drstone you have been gifted coins aa hes so hoti am really really happy for dokja he turned it out amazingly i am waiting for the next episodeüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäfck yesdokja woke up and chose violence and i love itbro that sword is so coolthis is is just too good ive spent my night reading thisüò≠don‚Äôt these people know it was their choice to buy food from him you can‚Äôt get your money back with out giving the product back dummiesgoo dokja he doesnt owe them anything when they treated him so badly dokja kinda looking like a psycho at the end there and i kinda i like itthe secret is that the coins they use is the coins us readers use to buy fast passesüòâdammnn dokja you rulei agree with dokjas logic why should someone that killed someone else to save themselves get coins from him for free what makes them so deserving of the coins also the food he had hed gathered for himself and was even willing to sell it to them they were not obligated to buy it nor was it his fault when it disappearedhonestly i would do the same in this situation being pushed around by the incite ability can only go as far as you let itdokja just killed a strong monsterwhat are these puny humans gonna do to him lol gtfohes simply just thinking about his own future theres nothing wrong with that people already do it in this world but are more corrupt about it damn manz tryna live dudei thought he would tell them that the glasses clown has coins but this might be better since even if all of these people manage to get past this round theyre guaranteed to die on the next round anyways lolfinally a character not scared of anything take their arms off kingwhy should you share you grabbing other people shit without asking to borrow it this guy is a smart dudeyou know what this is kim dokja the best mc ever and for novel readers did dokja acted like this in the novel i dont remember clearly but i think he was not that angry i really really want this to get turned into an animei got where hes coming from if he gives those ppl the coins thats equivalent to giving all the clothes off your back in the dead of winter and you die and they still in trouble it benefits for a sec but it didnt truly help i kind of like the route his character is taking a lawfully good character would have been supremely irritating because they would continuously sacrifice themselves without thinking of the personal repercussions just like an avg person hes neutral preservingoh my god im loving this so so much and its getting better every single episodemental note dont ask dokja for anything or i might lose my handshe risked his life to get those coins and what did y‚Äôall do just sit around in the station expecting someone else to do the work for youdokja has hit his point i like this character so awesome i like itthese comments literally sound like constellation commentary lol but dokja really is an interesting character because he has a lot to deal with pleasing the constellations trying to stay alive while also helping others it‚Äôs really unfair because he has worked really hard for his coins while other people do nothing and just expect the coins to be handed to them gosh this whole comic is amazing ‚ú®king‚ú® periodtwell that was hot nosebleeds you see nothingif dokja decide to side with that high moral to help those people he will defintely get trapped in cheon inho plan just like if you being kind to the people for one time they will ask you another kindness thats how human do even in the our world and inho want that for his own selfishness and so he can using and controling dokja thats why what dokja do here is right that last panel tho üëåüèªyaaass im so satisfied with his decision not everyone deserves your own kindness just gotta show em what u r truly capable of which enough to dread others and back offlegit wanna hear dokjas voice and the action asfkjfdlüò≥ if this turn out to be an anime üôä theres no word can express my mind see this is why i couldn‚Äôt survive in an apocalypse i‚Äôm too nice the lawful neutral best clift hanger everthis is definitely going to be an anime the way this story is progressing and the twist and turns they‚Äôve made so far and it‚Äôs only been chapters yes yes yes i love this scene what comes after is so great honestly so satisfyingbiyungs reactions on the indirect messages is so kawaii he is a antiheromy man went from midoriya to kirito real quick really thinking about buying the fast pass now this is hype afi think i would make the same decision considering the coinsi would ask and i would make decisionsya know what would be really awesome if dokja just killed the leader and took his coins im really liking this series thanks for your hard workdokja has impressed me by showing how smart and calm he iswhat those fools should of known is that everyone has a breaking point and his just got destroyedim glad that dokja isnt gonna put up with this pricks bull anymore it makes me happy to see hes not in a gaming moodremembers how people usually ask for scope the day before an exam and the aducity to ask for stationery the hour before exam me why should ibest character ever‚ú®the apocalypse blame gamefinally the snowball plushy mini demon is back not that other bratthe constellation is very impressed with your performance she decides to gift you she also says thank you for replinishing her sanitydokjas squad shouldnt return back to the camp they can just survive on their owndaaanggg someone cover the kid‚Äôs ears this is about it get even uglierafter reading the webnovel i can‚Äôt begin to tell you how happy i am with this seeing it in picture is one thing now we just need a studio to bring it to lifedokja be likei dont give a fucki love how he doesn‚Äôt care if i were him i‚Äôd do the same cause why should you care when these ppl are all selfish bustardsdamn how i hate these people in storys who only blame others like that wont help or solve the problem mc has no friggin bussines giving them free coins and then die himself like bruhi did think he would pull out his sword but i did not expect him to cut off the dudes hands jsjsjjsjsjsi feel like the mc is going to become more of an anti hero you know kinda like deadpool but a little more sanedoes anyone know how their names are pronounced especially gilyeongme being a huge fan of rpg‚Äôs i‚Äôm really interested to see how our little group of characters changes not only emotionally but their skills and items tooi % agree with my mans over here billion iqhmm i‚Äôd say he‚Äôs a lawful neutral still does good things and follows the law but like he‚Äôs really only in it for himself and maybe a few others if he cares about them enough although that‚Äôs probably not that likelyok but dokja that was kinda hot ngl üôàwhat about the business man he got like million or thousand coins from the curse thing didn‚Äôt hei love dokja even morebadassi was so interested in this webtoon that after reading the last episode i went ahead and read the webnovel lolwhy the hell he needs to share this is apocalypse he gained his coins slaughtering demons he doesnt need to share it with some man only sitting in the corner safely i would do the same with one exception i would spare kids pov you dont remember the actual main characters name they may think he was acting villain but no hes just being logical and i like itdont worry bro you can open your character status in like chapters i‚Äôm so glad dokja didn‚Äôt do what other people would deem the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing those people are hypocrites especially that whatshisface he should die firsthuh come on even the lil kid is using his survival skills its high time these people understand dokja way to go boy man i really dislike inho cheon i think dokja is doing the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing we‚Äôll see exactly what he plans next chapter he didn‚Äôt take those coins from anyone they willingly paid because they wanted the food he originally collected himself and he brings up a good point that all these people who are alive now most likely killed someone in the first scenario to survive i can‚Äôt wait to see how the characters develop especially huiwon also can‚Äôt wait to see what fate belongs to inhowho would give out coins to help killers survive like who the hell they think they area lot of top comments are saying everyone there had to kill in the first scenario but like there are clearly young children & older people present maybe they got lucky and had a different scenario bc i dont remember dokja or dokkaebbi saying the first quest was the same for all users but also even if it was the same maybe some of them had similar solutions to dokja in that scenario and the comments are saying its pragmatic to let all those people die i disagree thats eugenics i need coins too üòú to read any furtherlolall this time i thought the dokaebbi eyes were just hollow sockets when in reality he‚Äôs got these cutesy bubble eyes üò≠damn he really said bye bye to that guys arms i like how different dojka thinks im quite interested to see what he does next i cant deny it that guy was good at manipulating people at the right time he knows when to use his powerful enchanting words that was a nice battoujutsu i like this episodeomg i think i have a crushdokja hello my name is dokja and im chaotic neutral nice to meet youdokja thats dark i like it hehehethe color of his words are as ice cold as he is ryt now lolread the web novel guys it is srsly amazing and you will not regret it i couldnt wait for more of the webtoon so i started the novel and i have been reading it non stop for the past three days coz its so good i keep trying to recommend it but it feels just like when dokja tried to recommend twsa and no one listened to him yk this is a very interesting turn of events üëÄaand now we have a psychopath as the thumbnail for a week being kind is good but being a pushover isnt all those ppl would die anyway because they are bad players so dojka would only kill himself for nothing he made the correct decision when the world gets bad enough the good go crazy but the smart they go bad he just stated clearly no to socialism just dokja being dokja at this moment they should know they fcked upthey do realize they are trying to say they deserve coins and then attempt to murder their only chance at survival plus they dont even know killing him will give them back their coinsi need coins too yasss dokja slayss ‚ú®‚ú®that villain is dangerous and cunning he turns everything against you including your actions and wordsgenius kill someone then take your coins back by having to touch fingers where the person transferring coins has to think absolutely brillianti would rather be a villain who does good sometimes than be a heroyass i had to same he very logical character and puts himself first mf went sicko mode üíÄim not even halfway through this webtoon but i just know this is going to be one of my favouritesif u want your coins back give the food back or did u eat it alreadyconstellation broke reader is satisfied with the amount of head rubs dokja is giving gilyeongcrissy wake up i dont like this üòÄright decision dude dokja is not your typical saviour protagonist lolall i could say is slaydokja i love you very much dasurrrvv ahabshsjjdhssudokjas character ‚ú®ü§åüèªhe kind of look like sung jin wooi‚Äôm liking dokja he‚Äôs being smart and realistic in this situation yess i like the kind but logical mc hes kind but hes a human he must be kind to himself and the people he care first before random people who just want to leech ‚ù§hes right he risked his life for those coins and he better not give them to people who just sat there and complained as said before age or gender doesnt matter here u can just upgrade ur stats instead of complaining abt not wanting to diedokja is karma incarnate you reap what you sowthat was a wise decision dokja üëèi am very sick because of the development of the dokja character üôÉ it making the situation more interesting day by day ü§†he‚Äôs being realistic i mean these people are murderers and can‚Äôt even pay for the sin the committed dokja went out of his way and earned these coins so why should he give them he would just make lose and what would these people give him backin return nothing he‚Äôs not all goodie it‚Äôs an apocalypse a fucking apocalypse crazy people üíÄ he wants to survive everyone wants to survive you should be held responsible for you own live they are all moral incorrect inc dokja protag who doesnt care about moral high ground woof woof woof üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èothers give me back my coins dokja suck my ass the absolute irony of making the beginning villain a literal edgelord just to pull the same garbage with your main charactereven if he did give them coins they would be monkeys and stay in the station and die the next day anyway _ bruhanyone sharing is caring dokja i dont get paid enough to carethats right show them what kind of people would be like in the future aggressiveness and despirationthese people have the audacity to think that they can kill someone and then beg for their lives like btw has anyone realised that there is another little kid there with his mum r u telling me he killed somebody too dangi would of done the same and i would say that if you arent going to risk it for the biscuit then you are unreliablei love how the kid is just holding his skull weapon so calmly while watching a mans arma get cut offüíÄwait‚Ä¶ i just realized that people would have automatically completed the first round as the body regenerates cells and others die off constantly and a cell is a living organisim rightif these people want to survive so much then they should probably go and do something instead of expecting to leech off of people who go out and earn their survival like dokja doesyes lets go dokjaa i really love his character its a breath of fresh air im so happy dokya isnt the stereotypical goodtwoshoes im so tired of seeing main characters doing things out of guilt and morals especially if theyre not obligated toi mean you want coins but do nothing to help its a tought world you live in you gotta earn the right to livedeath note vibes right nowi love dokja glad hes not a dumb mc actually love his villain side loldokja joey doesnt share food hes a villain a smart one that protects his comradessoo coolllbut not rlly i woulda done smth to return fire on that other evil guyoh and welcome back bihyeong fluffineeesshiit that was so sexy damnthis unlike him~ but this is going to be exciting dokja youre so coolbihyeong~ i miss you ~~yes dokja slice themlove this don‚Äôt give in to the majority complainers who did this to themselveschaddokja slayyoh you want your coins back revive every single person you killed in the first scenario and give me back every bit of perfect food i sold to you ^^i dont think hes decision is not really evil if think of it those people are the one who blame him from the start so in short those type of people are just face they only agree with you if they get alot of benefits from it without doing something think about it he work so hard to reach that point while those people are just chilling there waiting for miracle to happen doing nothing and blame other for their own misery oh my goddd i got goosebumps dokja my king hello he is so cool üò©üò©üò©üò©üò©üò©i‚Äôm freakin so enjoying this twist of personality ughhh i hate constantly seeing unrealistically good morales people bruh in this kinda situation u gotta do everything to survive it‚Äôs a two way street if ur gonna help someone hes so coolok not gonna loe they coulda put a finer face on that last panneldokja casually showing off his absolute dumptruck as he slices that man‚Äôs arm offwhy does the last slides remind me of ninang bryan from tiktoküòÇwait i just want to make sure that her god person thingy is theseus or theaus i forgot but i remember playing a game and it was labrynthy and it said something about the string the thsues guy used to navigate the doungeoun but im pretty sure were thinking ü§î rightactually i agree with him i would probably be the villain so to say if i was to a survival world like this also hes not completly selfish he did share things with his companions and gave them a very good discount too all in all hes just trying to survive and the people in there all have killed someone to survive while he hasnt so in the end the way he does things to me is pretty justifiedomfg finally a character who doesnt have hero saving syndrome hero saving syndrome is something i created it basically means the mc tries to save everyone even when its clearly dangerousyes use the üó° i wanna see what it does üòàüòàif i had to guess dokjas moral alignment if guess that hes either chaotic neutral or neutral evilfinally but i do hope atleast the children can be savedomg dokjas new sword why is bihyeong so cute i want to hug him so badif i was in dokjas position i would have given them help immediately but probably would regret it later on because people are fickle minded they can demand for your help and forget what you did for them and turn on you later on he became that nerd into badass real quickhe actually did the right thing its good he said no coins arent cheap they should of worked hard to earn some they had all day lazy people wanting handoutshes just like meevery bitch in this platform other then dokja group survived by killing someone and now they are begging for there lifeohh schnapp üëÄüëÄüëÄgoatjany goati love himthats what i would have done if i was himbro this guy so badass it‚Äôs hotüò≠üò≠ no homoifw dokja being such a dynamic mcdokja omg ily hes so fineget disarmed squatsman this is awesome i love a good antiherojesus loves you finally yes my insides are melting this is a top tier protagonist right here not like some cliche saint wannabe masochistic protagonist like in every other web novelmangahes so handsome constellation dark flame phoenix smiles at dokjas sudden change in personality and cruel wayshe made a good move literally half of the people there were bad people anyways they deserved itthe way dojka cut the persons arm was the coolest thing ever i have seen all weekshit escalated realquickhell yeahhh texting with the host snapping this is amazingdespite most people thinking that secretive plotter is the author im gonna guess its dokja himself or at least a different version of him my reasoning the fact that the secretive plotter recommended a scenario and that dokja has said that he has recommended twsa to others is the reasoning weak yes but its there and weak enough for it to be a well crafted twist in my opinioni‚Äôm absolutely in love with this story shame on me for not finding this earlieri dont care how cruel i might sound right now but just kill them all already i cant stand this anymorei really cant hate bihyung if hes this cutemoral high ground umm excuse me but this is the apocalypse yes tell them dokja üò©honestly id be so fed up i wouldve snapped a lot earlier than dokja didas he should beat they asses dokja this is why everyone likes dokjaalthough tonka is acting a little evil he probably is trying to do this to somehow reason to the people and break hans incite skill and probably earn a incite skill himself furthermore he might himself ask the people to collectively kill hans and his henchmen which will make the people earn the required coins go kinghyeonsyeong is a big man child and i‚Äôm here for itagain hes so hotdokja is a really interesting character ambiguous gray characters are my favorite if portrayed correctly its their fault too hahai love dokja he‚Äôs not one of those ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù but he‚Äôs more interesting love an unhinged character more of him plsi love how dokja is keeping a balance between the ryt sense of morality and the manipulative aspects of the situation while on one end he is keeping his promise to get food and is doing as much as he can to keep the ones in charge from doing anything bad he isnt tolerating any kind of manipulation and taking his stand we stan üò≠üôåyaasssjhdhhdhhdhdhdshshvnndndndnhf so satisfying im curious in the raw is gilyeong call dokja only by his name or he call dokja by hyung dokjaa my duudeegod damn dokja is cold blooded üòó‚úåÔ∏è beat their as üòàüòàüôèüòàüòàüòàüëπüòòi love his character so much more nowconstellations smiledok smiles evilyme both but with laughterdokja do be having a cute butt doeand if i refuse on a tshirtchillshyeonseong cutiei like that it seems like dokja is becoming more like yu the longer the story goes ondream be like sharing is caring and i dont caredokja is maintaining the high moral ground as he said the first scenario was the original sin they all murdered someone to survive but have since been living on handouts failing to take responsibilities for their own lives after taking someone elses in his eyes they arent good people and have proven time and time again to be scummy or pathetic on top of being murders besides coins doesnt seem that hard to make with these mood constellations ü§£ hell yes you dont owe these people anything they have the gull to take a life but not the balls to survive by their own accord i think he should just drop it all on han and let him use those coins he just goti love that dokja isnt the golden child and is morally gray like so happy for it its so much more realistic i really like this dude he is giving me serious life lessons atmyou need to make an anime out of this i havent got this worked up over a story in a whilepfft at least dokji and i have the same though it‚Äôs their fault for being so dependable they should also hunt their own foodsif i were him i‚Äôll be like ‚Äúi need to take care of myself for today tomorrow and so on‚Äù called me selfish if you want but it‚Äôs survival instinct why did i smile when dokja slice that man armüíÄslayy them alll hun esp tht bastard incho whtever tht iswelp time to kill them allüò∂he do be kinda scarycutie bihyeong is backkthe constellation of me is satisfied with your doingüòÜüòÜmy guess is he‚Äôll help ppl who help him and leave ppl behind who wrong him but who knows idfk im getting major bi himbo vibes from hyunsung since the beginning yeah glad he finally snappedoh man i missed bihyeong like he‚Äôs so adorable i really appreciate the constellations comments lolso no ones gonna talk about how the giant insect beat the stone rhino in a fightok lets be reali mean why would he give the coins he earnedeven if he give how long they are gonna survive day day and to how many of them he can givethe only thing they will try to do is suck him until his coins get finished ofc becoz he looks easy among ones with high coinsinho or they may even kill himand then go to another thats how it workswhat a badasswonder what the constellations thought of that stop using your money on coins ii didi just think it‚Äôs funny and creative how they incorporated the constellations reaction to different situationsi dont know how the angel will react thoughhe attac backthe constellation the sleepy chaos is too lazy to interactcheon inho keeps getting on my nervesbro they didn‚Äôt risk their lives to stay alive why should he share with lazy cowardsi know this guy is tired i feel bad for all of them i mean probably all those people killed or let someone died in order to survive yes the good thing to do would be to share but why should he really i do think that moral is an important thing and kindness is a great value to have but you cant force other people to be kind nor righteous specially in a world like that and especially when theyll most surely turn their backs on him once he stop been useful i dont like many of his decisions but i understand themis it just me or is bihyeong looking more like the demonic child of monokuma and pikachuto be honest people probably thought there wouldnt be a survival fee so they mightve bought food with the rest of those coins so in a way he is kind of responsible for their deathyeah bihyoeong is back i thought they removed him bachade he made the contract but i guess not nice though hed be really cute if he wasnt such a sadistah a fellow antihero i see i really wanna find out who is the secretive plot constellation ook like um naofumi was like this the stupid princess lied got him in trouble and he became a good bad guy just like dokjakinda wish we could see his total coin count would k really break the banknoo don‚Äôt lose your mindhah plopbeautifuloooh that hurt woah dokja hejehehwbnehd so coolüò≠food horder is pleased by dokjas actionsi mean he‚Äôs not wrong but he‚Äôs also not rightitd be funny if he sold out mr suit for his k coinsi jus noticed this but the art style is similar to unholy bloodthe entitlement really jumped outhyeonseong lee looks a bit like our voltron space dadabsolutely no onedokja the concept of what we know as what is good and what is bad left this world when this game started damn perfect response reminds me of those beggers in assassins creedthe way i smack my leg from that scene can be heard all the way to the next villagefr you wanted to live you cant take care of your selfthat old man is uselessinteresting ü§© i really want this to be a book so i can keep with me and i can recommend to others oh get over yourselffinally a realistic character me why would i give my coins to you too i just find it funny that the sound effect for dokja cutting of that mans hand is plopüò≠üò≠i dont know why but i like the main character always teaching the person in wrong a lessonoop if he lost his finger did he loose his money xdoh he‚Äôs somewhat of an evil character evil in the way that he causes grief to those who care about himdokja i love youyay bihyeong is backi love how dokjas a morally grey character i completely agree with everything he did it makes sense cuz hes not obligated to anyone and he is kinda helpful to some people so yeahomniscient reader huge chicken legsits finger lickin goodi mean dokjas right theyre the ones who survived because they killed people and now they blame dokja for them not being able to survive because of the lack of coins so pathetic and what a hypocritedude was like no thanks hes backdamn dokja yes kinggg üòåhave i ever said how much i do love dokja üòñ‚ù§ ahh and the story is barley beginning gosh damn someone pass me some chicken wings this is getting goodwould dokja count as a morally grey character ü§îoh finally this is what ive been looking for to an mcwell it is true if you can not survive on your own in that kind of world why would you still wanna live üëÄshart getting realomg smilethose ppl deserve this they already commited sin in the first scenerio and now they r blaming dokja for this situation heck yea dokja made the ryt decisionwhy is everything going so smoothly people give the coins dokja why people kill that bastd dokja big mistake slash people sht readers yessthat was unexpected i thought dokja would defer the crowd to that han guy who has coinsi wonder where this will gohyeonseong lee has begun too simp on you üòÇüòÇüòÇif he has the most coins that means he has the most fighting experience some people should know that instead they should bargain with himthere are people like them everywhere manipulated by others and just live following the flow they dont have any passion to pursue and go with the majority even i am like that sometimes this just gave me a smack on my head watch out junghyeok yu theres a new protagonist in townyaaasss dokja yaasswow dokja is really cool but why didn‚Äôt he throw that guy who killed him under the buson that last panel dojka got üéÇüéÇüéÇhahaha i like this f@ckng reader this type of character is what i want to see may the f@ckng creator make more characters like this hahaha f@ck you guys btwas marcus always says no refundsthis is true shit bro why you gotta be helpful and all that stuff selfishness is human nature but they bought the food with their coins earlier then they want a refund smham i sensing light yagami vibes right nowgive his food back if they want their coins i like dokjas neutral personlityeeeki felt bad for them up until he pointed out that they had to kill someone to get this far ok ok okaay be a bad bitch fine by mewhy do i remember shen qingqiu with the blue thingy heck yeshyeonseong lee is adorable with the way his eyes are sparkling ‚ú®they‚Äôre blaming dokja that they dont hav enough coins when it was their choice to usegiv them to himi think im in love üò≥dokja has join the dark sidehuiwon be ready to killits demon time üòàüòàüòàüòàüòàüòàdamn dokja i got chillsthis is great for a moment there i thought i was reading solo leveling this webtoon is so good it reminds so much of solo leveling and i like how they dint copy solo leveling and made it their own thing every week i have to wait for a new chapter for solo leveling but now to wait i can read this this is probably my second favorite webtoon behind solo leveling i love this bookdokjas development is impressive his judgment based on logic and reasoning and him not letting anyone wear him down or manipulate himits a leader quality üëè his eyes went from innocent at the start of the series to downright badass nownow he pulled it out and slammed it on the tabledokja is a true capitalistholy fricking moly i love this webtoon who else read the web novel im up to ch now üòé btw im bragging %did sangah notice what dokja was doing when he was trying to see her personal attribute im afraid of what will happen to his group now so far they have all trusted him because he has helped them out to some degree but after he cut off that guys arms and isnt helping anyone then maybe they will go against him too if they did how would that change things and how come he didnt out the other guy didnt he get a bunch of coins after taking the last blow of the monster dokja beatremember the name roecleanconstellation galiate is speechlessi want some of his wits also his ability to read the room and say no impresses me to an extreme levelthis manga is exactly my type sad thing is i cant buy coins cuz im broke cliffhangers are illegaldepending on others is not a bad thing but if they tell you to depend on them otherwise that would be cruel to them üòîshits going down mananyone else thought dokja is doing hood rnthe constellation fangirl shipper is pleased with this developmentpeople giving all they got just to live another day hes a reader its understandablethe moment dokja drew his sword i heard megalovania begin to playdude that last scene was sooo bad asome people bout to get torn upi feel like hes a little too prepared for this world that right now hes not fully accepting what around him is real hes just doing what hed dream of doing for years while reading the story i think theres going to be a moment where he really reflects on his actions and maybe breaks down ngl sangah gave away her attribute and sponsor with this but since it‚Äôs major spoilers i‚Äôll refrain from saying anything wait bihyung was the one responsible for the item box jeez i‚Äôm on chapter and that‚Äôs still new info aww they‚Äôre all so happy and now they‚Äôre not i gotta say inho was clever but dokja was just two steps ahead heythe cursed guy got k coinsso once they realize that he‚Äôll be chased by the others xdlol dokja‚Äôs not just gonna give these people welfare they don‚Äôt deserve itwhat about the deamon killer with k coins wheres he at throw that btch under the buslook at the flick of that wristüíÄhe looks so psychotic in that last panel i love this character so fking muchyeah if it were me id be a clear looks like you fellas are gonna die today siigh i wish i werent broke then i could read the next seven episodesim so proud a main character with some gutsdokja i love you i deada died when he said that üòÇi wonder how will be the character development of dokja hmm me when my sister tries to take my food her gimme summ me why should i what really shocks me about this story is how no one out of the main group has said anything about their family members its so sad to be taken away from everyone you love so fast gosh thats why i really really like this webtoon wooh plot twistimmaculatemans grew moon ballsthat guy i dont have enough coins to give coins to all this poor peopleme if i was dokja bitch do i look as if i caredidn‚Äôt what‚Äôs his face sell them food toome reading all the episodes times wiating for the next oneplop plop the dudes arm got chopped choppedi love dokja‚Äôs character he‚Äôs not going to be the main character that always wants to do the right thing even when it could cost him his life he‚Äôs more logical and i think that‚Äôs gonna make the story a lot more interestingthe next week well see a lot of blood and i cant waitthing is he still kinda is maintaining the moral high ground who knows what these people did in the initial scenario on top of many already having shown to be straight up bad guys particularly those led by the gang leader dude so not only is it not a stretch to assume these people arent as innocent as they seem but its also very likely that they werent lucky and killed some bugs like dokjas group did which considering what dokjas thoughts have been this is exactly what hes thinkingthe man snapped lmaogod dayum double cheeked up üò©üò≥dokja showing them what‚Äôs upbesides that guys hands hes so hotjust walk to him poke poke poke with that iron thingy and coins rewarded from the neet godthat was one hell of a turnthe way my voice cracked when i screamed hell yedokja made it clear that hes not messing around why would anyone take him as a push overoh theres gonna be one for female character and she go be a badass this is so good i loving this so farüòÑcan‚Äôt wait to see what happens nextit‚Äôs the apocalypse bishesü§£ something had to snap eventually he was petering on the edge of this from day onei have to wait days for the free episodenooo i neeed moreit would be cool if dokja ends up being the antagonist and the protagonist remains the same he did say the regressor lost his humanity after regressing times maybe dokja will lose his over time given how strong he is itll be interesting to see how characters like sangah can beat his fourth wall ability especially since he has no character profile on her it is possible to beat dokja since gilyeong already has an idea of what dokja is capable ofif im remembering this correctly isnt the cost of a human life coins so if he killed half of them probably the ones trying to kill him then he could save the other halfi feel like dokjas alignment would be neutral because he seems to fit into a morrelly grey area seeing as he isnt evil but then he also isnt good either its really cool to see characters such as dokja who dont stick to morals but still arnt evil i‚Äôm in love with this webtoonhe got you the food twice you expect him to help you when you didn do shidemon

that glare i would have left immediatelywell i mean since he read the comic he kinda is prob the reason why this is happening so yeahonly the smart strong and clever ones survive in this scenario you need to do whats best for you in this case become a villainsome people will resent him but thats just what he needs to docan i jus say im loving this because im having a great time seeing dokja

maybe even evil neutral definitely not any gooddokja is a dope mc tlike bish if you wanted to survive should have gotten the other scenerioi freaking love this form the looks of it dokjas alignments is going to be neutral goodthis is survival game who just who will share their advantage to others üòÉüòÉyes dokja slay kinglmao i would‚Äôve asked them for a scholarship essay üòå earn your share bishhthat scene right there reminded me of light and lyesssfinally the killer instinctactually i dont know if i would have been capable to refuse helping others but i love how he responded to them i am totally in love with this comic and i wanted to ask if you have a book in the making or possibly making this into a anime series i will buy all of them as soon as they come out this is the best comic i‚Äôve read in so long and you literally have me hanging on a thread can‚Äôt wait to read some more your loyal readerdokja is not one to stick to being the gold coin of the people and that is great because it is proof that u owe nothing to no one and u are not entitled to them and honestly i wouldnt share coins either if i were in the place of dokja cuz he worked hard and killed beasts to earn those coins and they think just by threatening him they will get coins hell naw get off ur asses and go do something useful for once lmaoodayum the art looks so much like solo leveling im sooo excited yheeits so good to see something different fuck heroism life is hard and heartlessgive me some coins i wanna read what happens next otlhaha dokja is pissedlets goooaahhh i love this mc he‚Äôs not like tho‚Äôs mc who will always choose to do the ‚Äúgood‚Äù things this is getting to be more interesting and i love itoh damn dont get any closer or you gonna look like a trex with short armsholy shii nuggeysgangstaoh my gosh yes i‚Äôve been searching for a story like this great route to take with this development üòçüòçi miss this savage dokjayou have activated bad ass modei love dokja i would have killed them all as soon as they started asking for my fooddokjas reaction serves them all right üòÇüòÇ they killed someone in the first scenario and now they want dokja to give the coins for which he sacrificed many thingsüßêüßêohh i love his crazy eyes still those poor peopleugh that was so sexy of dokjathe constellation asks for five coinsdokja im your proud and loud simp did he really think dokja would just let them kill himnooo i want to read moree sobsyess slice themaye rambo kill them all an donedokja is so cooli would‚Äôve said that cursed jerk off has thousands of coins he is pissedomg i missed bihyeong soo much ^^ üòöüòöüòç glad that hes back yall being like the moral high ground um bro it‚Äôs even the moral high ground to give them coins i wouldn‚Äôt say that decision is morally not good at all obviously it‚Äôs isn‚Äôt the bad thing but like jdjeh yeits true it does look pathetic to blame dokja like its their fault for not go hunting for the mf coins dokja is such a cool character i love characters like himglad the survival fee only exists in the story otherwise i‚Äôd be dead right now üòÖüòÇ i have zero coins on webtoon & it‚Äôs right nowfuckemim here just hoping that gilyeong and others in the group wont get scared or distrustful of dokja because of this or telling him that he should help them those people dont deserve it and dokja is % right with taking that approach even if he helped them theyd never pay backi really love this webtoon so freaking satisfying omg im in loveüòçüòçüòçunlike other male leads his plots are different and alot more intresting neither op nor weakwell a man tries to murder you to survive at the orders of a coward so you make an example out of him perfectly reasonable in the apocalypseyes that badass moment im waiting for he trynna survive the apocalypse okayno time for begging noobs just get good smhsuper coolfreak school ami right fellasyess yess take my moneyyou don‚Äôt always have to be kindariadnes thread sjsndbdis he going to go full lelouchwow i dont agree how he handled the situations but then again when the other guy is like that the rest wont listen to what he wants to say but this is so amazing tt_tto kawaii koto‚Äúdokja is not like that‚Äù she saidgirl don‚Äôt do it dokjadokja be like oh please just shut updokja adios ‚Äúamigos‚Äùtook dudes arms ok that was hot ü•µü•¥ü§íü§íü§íü§íwell its true that everyone there had to kill someone or something to even get that far and they have nothing to offer him still i hope he doesnt go full edgelordi like how dokja chose a nonethical way the next chapters are going to be üåüimmaculateüåüo holy mother of god this made him x hotter ü•µthats my baby loving how closely this follows the novel glad to be able to see the characters ive only read about drawn out and coming to life this toon makes my wednesdays betterwe love seeing morally grey characters man give me someone i can really relate too wait didn‚Äôt the other guy who got cursed have the most coins everyones gangsta until dokja shows upnext week needs to be here tmmrüò≠üò≠it‚Äôs the apocalypse at a certain point it‚Äôs everyone for themselves ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èjust a reminder to all the people who want him to share because its the right thing to do all of these people begging for coins are murderers and its not like hes obligated to help them either just because he is the main charactermy man dojka is going for that chaotic neutralevil routesavage dokja i admit it i am bored of all good and soft main leads i want something worth and here comes dokja the savage king actually in real life everyone is selfishblood for the blood godeveryones coming up with big brain comments and im here like lol dokjas hoti love this sword it makes me feel like im welding a idk justsomething good ya knowdaamn that was sickkill them alli hadnt thought of the first scenario like that they all killed someone else to be here and thus nullifies any reason to even attempt for a moral high ground most of dokjas group killed insects and remains for the time being non murderers very interestingits easy to say this cause its a fictional story but not everyone was gonna survive anyway why not just get rid of the pricks and assholes like thisthe decision he take might be seem wrong but tbh if i was at his place i would do the same thing i guessyeah cut their asses thats mah boyi would have had them compete for the coins like top five get a loan for the survival fee and maybe i‚Äôll let them join me or fight for me later to pay it back their debt pahahahahaha i love psycho dokja hahahahahais there no one mention about how gilyoungee calling dokja in the novel he call dokja hyung since he is younger than dokja maybe its better to change how gilyoungee call dokja in the next episodethey fucked up they fxcked up they fxcked up my mans went off not like they can cancel himi like the scans translation of the last scene more it was more epic and cool which got me excited for the next chapters this mess youre all in do you really think its my fault goosebumps all over my body after that linefinally im sick of these people who just wait for help and do nothing that inho cheon too his character is disgusting people like him never admit their mistakes and push the blame onto others all the time while making it seem that theyre a saint despicable i agree with dokja those people are being pretty selfish even though they want to survive they cant be aggressive and start asking for a refund of what they already ate sotoo late people üíÄooh its starting to get interesting teehee üòÜüòÜaye yoi screamed out loud when he cut his arms off he‚Äôs serious imagine you attack someone and they whip out a sword and chops your hands off ah a normal dayyes suddenly the apocalypse is turning into a double apocalypse he can‚Äôt give all these people coins everyday just to survive dokja has no real obligation to these people they never saved his life he only profited off of them and the only people he really has ties to is the people in his party so i stand by his decisionbihyeong is backüò≠‚ù§Ô∏èoofhe does have a point everyone there is likely a murder and the people who tell him to be a good person are the worst ones well they are the one who demand food and now they are putting the blame on dokjawow such a pathetic humansüòïi want to see the thug leadee dieüòèi want to see the thug leadee dieüòèhe gonna kill that blonde and when he does i‚Äôll be laughingwell he did nothing wrong everyone who managed to make it here killed somebody but did not have the guts to carryon and earn their living so no one has any obligation to meet their demands if he lets them survive now by giving in they will only die next round because they are incapable of surviving on their own thats a wasted investment okay that went from to real quicki highly doubt dokja is gonna let the random kids die if he does then the support of his allies goes down the gutter and most the constellations gonna hate himi love this series the constellation dania twilight is laughing her teeth off due to the evil face of the incarnation dokja kim the constellation dania twilight is too broke to gift you coins coins please i just need coins to buy the next episodeugh i love main characters like this bc the plot is so interestingdokja i getchu bud thats the exact reason why i dont like to play a hero every person will ask u about ur morals i have read this novel til the end just incase you know survival of the fittest bitchesdokja looks more handsome when hes being mean are interested to see your moves to me dokja seems like a good guy but instead of giving handouts he‚Äôs teaching others to be responsible for their actions and in his own ways helps his friends enjoy this type of kim dokja while you still can this man is going to throw handsboi this world is twisted now and days so survival is the way to go not that i percent agree with dokja but still i love the twistsy e swhere did those huge drumsticks go ü•∫we get dokja is a badass and the other people are idiots but is no one going to talk about hyeonseong lee and his sheild its so sparklyhehe im excited to see everything illustrated i recently picked up the novel and am on chapter things haven gotten extremely interesting i recommend giving the novel a try if you ever have spare time ^^badassthis is funholy shitscary but real fing cooldamm hes neutral i dont know why people mad he cant look after others with no disregard to his own life in my opinion people should never be blamed for doing what they need to do to survivei love dokjas character aint like some typical protagonist with golden heartthis is a prime example of a good protagonistyeah bitches stop free loadingtheres a lady with a little boy i hope he does share some coins with them though vg is fascinated by your story and is waiting for new episodes he have no coins vis it me or dokjas really hot with that swordjust like the people in this current chapter i need coinslove it novel plot is really good and now the drawings i dont deserve this one bitcharacters like dokja are my favorite everyone its his faultdokja lemme tell you somethinlemme tell you somethinremeber communism works in theory but when put into practice it fails horribly everyone at the shelter should know thatuno reversed that green shirts threatooh~ dokja is so tenseyes boy ask for some respect if i may her skill reminds me of hisokas bungee gumüíÄunbroken faith in action looks absolutely stunninghe is taking a very interesting route had it been me i would have also refused to disclose little to any information as well fearing that it would cost my life however im kind of concerned to his development as an individual because in the beginning he was shy and seemed nice enough now he has become nearly similar to the regressor and its quite hard to hd anything against him when any other person in his shoes wouldve done the same bihyeong i missed yougreat chapter dokjas character is super interesting im very excited to see how this scenario endsbut i‚Äôm just a kidüò≠if i was grown and had lots of mobey i would turn this into animedokja is soo cooli rate it lowkey the big ego dudes fault cause he built a community that became like thati know that the crowd of people are heavy hypocrites but i really cant blame them theyre just trying to survive by buying food and asking for help from people who can help them its just a survival instinct and also imagine if you were in that situation you dont have powerful friends maybe youre not very good you dont have a good constellation and youre broke most importantly youre not the main characterprotagonist in the story at all so you have to live its just pitifuli love it this character us going closer to the chaotic neutral side but sticks firmly in true neutral this way in terms of dnd allinment checks he could instantly alter his actions to output a spicific looking outcome like he looks true chaotic evil then maybe if your pushing it episodes later he is neutralhe need to get to the alignment slowly and slowly he looks like the ideal lawful good protagonist instead he is a neutral character who is on for the ridecant wait for kim dokja whipping those bastard assesomg getting these updates is always one of the highlights of my studyfilled week im really interested to see how dokja turns out i love the direction its going in right nowyeess we love a morally grey characterjudgment time kim dokja is awesome xdonline schoolhome work can wait the childs life is more important must protecc‚úä‚ù§god i love it when character don‚Äôt take any sh√Æt üòå dokja is an ultimate savage loli just wanna binge thislook at those happy blushing face lee hyunseong is such a dorklets go dokja whooprotecc bby gilyeong my bby leemans speakin the teuth they all killed on the first round and everything they did up til then was their choice so they cant really blame amyone but themselvesdokja has a point here while he obviously wants to help he doesnt owe these people anything if they failed the test they failed the test he doesnt have to sacrifice his life for the sake of somebody elsepeople erase my foolish decisions and give me coins again so i dont suffer my own consequences dokja no ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüó°Ô∏èüó°Ô∏ècant he just finish the scenario and save everyone from payingdokja is added to the list of dark haired mcs i simp for thank you creator for my birthday giftüò™‚ù§im i the only one that finds the cotton ball thing cute‚Äúoh his arm got cut off huh‚Äùdokja you lit üí™he didnt have does kinds of morals he just didnt want to stand out but was forced to do so by a jackass with the power to manipulate the masses i‚Äôd kill someone for more coins to read ahead in this webtoon üòêi really want this to be turned into an anime it would be so good viva la revolutionbut it kinda made sense all those people survived because they killed someone and now that they can‚Äôt even manage to survive on their ownyou prick that t man is soo pathetic i cant stand ityou know what i like about dokja hes not like your usual mc who wants to save everyone who doesnt want anyone to die who wants to be the hero hes not really sympathetic and he sees things as they are eg these people were shit to me before so why should i help them do they deserve my help he wants to do whats best for him just like they all do except that hes not leaching off of others hes doing it himself i really respect him as a character for thatsome of you will die but that is a sacrifice i‚Äôm willing to make he looked like a badass at the end just like a villain and i absolutely love itüíñi am so hyped for next episoderealistically speaking most of these people are going to die anyway maybe not today or even tomorrow but they wont last with the monsters as a whole most people are weak they look for easy ways out and for others to do for them giving the money back or paying their way for more day only prolongs the inevitable and leaves you with even more people begging tomorrow this decision had to be made sooner or later this series is so amazing i‚Äôm so excited every tuesday after a hard day at work to read thiscounter offer nodokja you bastard that was too badassu go dokja i missed you dokkaebi if that was the spelling loldang dokja is ice coldinsert evil giggle if words dont work they bout to talk to these ‚ú®hands‚ú®what a badass protagonistwill i get killed if i say yesquestion for people who read the manhwa gilyounges stance in the last panel shows he is ready to throw hands for his new father figurehell yeah no stupid goodytwoshoes here babyhe could of shifted it to the rich annoying guy i dint remember the name of whi kill stealed to get k coinsdokja did the right thing you can‚Äôt blame some one for everything game is game i get excited when he cut off that mrons hand cant wait ‚àÜ decision]he looks so badassüòªüòªüòªüòªomg slayythat one guy who has over coins be like $$$see this is what im saying omniscience has a cost and that cost is that every interaction you have down to the smallest level is an equation you just need to solve for the best possible outcome and it doesnt matter what that takes or gains because its deffinitionally best its basically blue orange moralitytbh i dont like the heartlessness but at the same time i know damn well id do the same thing honestly its hard to judge this situation bc he doesnt know if everyone there actually killed someonesome couldve had the same idea with the bugs but at the same time its most likely they didi love his character right nowhyeonseong omgüòñüòñüíñthe leader of the major group is so manipulative i dont think any of the about to die characters tried it but if they had some coins left just not enough for the survival fee i might have been tempted to negociate with dokja to an exchange in order to die with a full belly like the last smoke but instead a last steaki know they probably have to do that but i laugh every time i see the notice of depictions of violence like you should have written that into the manga description its in almost every chapterüòÖgod damnü§ûü§ûblushin like a maniac rn ü§≠ü§≠what kind of dummy rushes someone with a sword personally‚Ä¶ who even cares bout these people they‚Äôre bloodthirsty as soon as things turn sour and they can‚Äôt see that the obviously evil leader is in the wrong here üòíedit and if you want to survive in an apocalypse situation like this you have to figure out a way to survive being a mindless background groupthinker is a surefire way to die ingenuity is the way to goha people with no moral tryna be moral loli really like how dokja doesnt try to compromise with everything in his way pretty refreshing tbhi think this would happen when something like this happen those people should start taking responsibility for their own after killing people from st round damnn that was so damn good so satisfying üò©üò©yes dokja slay slay those bitchesyes good choice dokjaslay dokjai really like the constellations they seem extremely cool especially the prisonerim happy he did that hyeonseongs reaction to the shield is pricelessahhh this feels so much better im tired of those characters who try to stay at societys standards you go dokjayay morally grey characters are my favoriteyeah kindai love that he is not niceamazing story and art please support the authortranslatori agree with dokja theyre in a position where they have it make an effort to survive and its the law of the chain strong and weak ones and he doesnt have to share his coins that he collect with his and team effort also you share once and theyll keep coming all the time cause they want the easy wayso agree totally with dokja hes not wrong or baddeserve so muchyesss ugh that was satisfyingslice oh your arm hit my blade congrats youve lost a couple of pounds loseryou seem confused you dont have power over him because he cant kill every single one of you you had power over him because he didnt want to that white thing are cute lol yet scaryso should i just ignore that there was no comments for the past few chapterswhats so bad becoming a villainoh yeah things are starting to get interestingbihyeong is taking me out üò≠üò≠dokjas character is interesting than most protagonists ive ever seenwait hold on arent we the readers the constellations in this casehe unlocked the rinnesharingan thats all i gotta sayhan myungoh had around thoque delicia finalmente um enche lingui√ßa dessa apanhando morality doesn‚Äôt even exist in this world anymore it all depends on the person‚Äôs values and dokja‚Äôs got pretty unpredictable values im sure he cares about the people he considers his team now and he even saved huiwon without expecting to gain anything in return which is odd cause he‚Äôs been doing things for his own benefit he also lied to gilyeong so he‚Äôd still have some hopeoptimismgod im loving dokjaman i love this but it makes sense since his whole thing is like im not the protagonist so why should i be a herogileyeong has a power to communicate with animals how cooolhe is soü§åüèªthe constellation loves the mche should at least give the coins back to the people that bought food he knew they would charge coins to live and took advantage not cooli like it dokja kim sharing is caring my ass idk but i like dokjaright decisionno hesitation i like ityeeess go tell em bruhhyou know i feel sorry for the small children unless their parents held someonesomething down and mental scarred by having them kill the children died dokja makes jin woo

caring dokja no its communismat first i disagree with dokjas actions but in second thought i realized he was really just fending for himself while it seemed like dokja swindled coins from the crowd knowing that the food he sold would vanish anyway and thus decreasing their chances of survival he only did it because the pressure was placed unto him plus he really didnt anticipate that survival fee so the incited mob were just reaping the consequences of their gullibility in letting themselves be manipulatedthe constellation ybahmedd laughs at the despair of those who tried to kill dokjayasssi genuinely love the fact that dokja is an antihero heyy our favorite fluffy pokemon is back oh my goshh hes so cool i love himmdamniminluvüòçre leerlo es asombroso como siempre a main

influence solo leveling had in breaking more mcs away from the traditional build dokja is a bossdokja üòâüòâüëåüëåüòåüòåüòåüíñüíñbye bye arms stan dokja and his cake jk pls he is so hot i feel like eating him üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠wüëåüèªwoww‚≠êthis is really awesome byebye armsomg omgdokja is developing moral is a creation of the previous world in this world moral dont existoh damn o he got unarmed omgkirito ngh dokjaam i the only one who thinks hes hotü•µi love dokja‚Äôs character smoh god hes so hothdjdjfwhjsthcdamnlike you should only get help if you deserve that if not dont make moral excuse rightwhy there is no music im literally being so loud right now just rooting for himanti heroi just hope the others dont lose trust in him for this because hes not even in the wrong tbhbro why tf is he built like the mc from tomb raider king all the characters have a really big similaritytjats my boynice dokjatbh im agree with dokja ü§£dokja is my unbothered king idk i think he is weeding out the evil people to help the good ones i think morally he does have the high ground on thisi am so curious at to the type of person dokja ishe isn‚Äôt a hero and not a villian eitherwell i meannn itll just be a nuisance if this type of people actually surviveskraaazythese people knew what was coming and if they have other people like kids or elderly to pay for as well hold off on food for a day if needed do something anything to get them that doesnt involve waiting til the last minute and going mental on this guy that worked hard for his im so glad he didnt back down or cave in to this worthless leaders gamesplop went his handgooddd my manpeople really get crazy when they are about to die why did they come back aywaysyes yes its starting to be interesting i love dokjathese idiots why did i laugh tho whats wrong with mewhy should he give them his coins they are just going to die soon i doubt they‚Äôll even make it the next payment point that‚Äôs a complete waste that‚Äôs not being a villain that‚Äôs just being smart do what you have to to survive i love how our mc is moral or immoral depending on the situation its refreshing that hes not % moral or % immoral dokja is really out here explaining the theme ‚Äúsharing is not caring‚Äùthe goon squad was so ready to attack pathetic scum he aint rich for nothing üòÇdokja worked very hard to get the coins and the weapons he worked very hard to level up to survive so what right do those people who have done nothing but living on other people‚Äôs efforts just like a parasites have to ask him to give them coinshes just surviving with a reason guys no need to be so poopy i completely agree with this decision because as shitty as it is this is the reality of this world and he knows that things cant go back to normal and if theres a wish that can then if they die at this point it wont matter so rather increase his chances as much as possible right now and keep as many coins to himself as possible because if they have to depend on him to get coins they wont survive in the future eitheryes finally hes not dumb and trying to act like a hero like other mc in every storyiesamen to that you made your bed so lie in itüòíwowdokkaebi looking cute rnone pair of hand is gone pair moreyou are special you are loved black swordsman oo this mans looks like nothing but a

lie and said id spent all my coins on the sweet new sword sorry not sorrycool theres no mercy for dishonest gangsters give us back our coins give me back my foodhonestly the people got that far by killing at the very least they could try to complete the scenarios although people in crisis rarely think rationally especially with that shit startertiny bihyeong  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ îhis legs were cut off

hero yesshehehehe gold diggersthis is so excitingthats how you play with these mfspls kid dont think bad about him you are sharp you know that is not his fult rightinsanity its kinda like letting a murder off his or hers sentence you wouldnt do that so why would he have to help them when they have nothing useful for him agree with his pov can somebody clarify if the completion of scenarios accects every member of the group or just who is fulfilling the requirementsi would‚Äôve have said ‚Äúwhat do i get for‚Äù or ‚Äúprove your worth‚Äù because these guys are just desperate anywayi would have paid them off in order to recruit an army to deal with inho with people dependent on dokja for food and then their very lives he could easily seize control of the station but i suppose power isnt his goalnot a single coin spent herewowowowowowi‚Äôm glad they are finally fighting those bastards constellation water sound and wind sound wanna see biyu asapgilyeong is so cute omghell yeah dokja go

him i would only help the people who were close with me and part of my group the women the boy and the other mani like this side of dokja i think dokja will end up as an antivillain or an antihero as we can see here he is still a good guy but has some evil qualities by not sharing his coins though i do agree with his decisionmeanwhile ima take a guess as to who sangahs constellation is httpsenwikipediaorgwikiariadne and dont tell me if im righti know hes seems like hes turing to a villain but i bet this is something hes doing just to scare them he really doesnt want to be the bad

afthe content creator is working up a battle im expecting a hell war to break loose next chapterü•∫evil mc boi this is so funny ü§£yeah think the man could spare us some coinsthere wasn‚Äôt any point in sharing coins the situation would repeat once and again and in the end people would still die and he‚Äôd be in an unfavourable situation with little to no coins he is not assessing the situation morally but practically in the long run he cannot really help themyuh dokja just snappedwelp natural selection bishes morals wont save you rn and thats how that man became withered chicaüòÅactually i liked dokjas decision as all the people there didnt had any morals right now & they are just burdens with selfish motivesits apocalypse do i have time to be nice i dont think sogod im so glad dokja isnt some kind of a saint too naive to just give coins to those people thats the reality you gotta knock or even slice some arms to give sense to some people loli love dis me whenever someone wants me to share my food because they think ill always be kind to them ughumm this is interesting i like this approach he‚Äôs takingdont you dare

and the drawing stylewhat a badasshis plan is to break the control of that influencer he is truly a terrifying villain he has to take him out before he levels up morewhy does this feel like fallout soo much dat buttshit i wanna sword like thatme reading episode on seriesalso me wow i like thems artsanyone say antihero because i thought i heard antihero lmaotell em dokjai thought dokja was just going to say myeonghan has coins to spare so he doesnt become the villain and doesnt lose coinsyou tell em dokjai didnt think this would be so good during the first few chapters im glad i didnt drop itwoeiooww theses people i want to fucking straggle themwow so much thought was put into this webcomicoooh this is getting excitingbihyung why you look so cuteü§ßü§ßguys be ready for the unpredictable scammer kim dojegai love they changed the perspective and made it seem like he was the bad guy and good guy at the same timei am loving this series so muchgreen shirt dudeim going to kill youdokja üòÇ nopepeople people attack the other dudehe looks scaryi like itohohoh some gonna die tonightthis is badhow can they just say that likethey should try to prove thier worth instead of trying to kill him like how dumb are youhe have more coins because of some reason peoplehes right though why should he give them coins also if he did the next time the fee shows up they are going to rely on him to give them coins then it turns into a cycle which might end him with no coinsi like the fact that the others are still behind him obviously positioned to protect himüî•yesss use logic not moralitygod damn this boy has some principles and im excited to see them like of course u ugly dead meats why would he do that hes not ur legal guardian or anything square the fk upi called there was gonna be a giant mantis i knew itthis is amazing dokja is awesome i always love a badass character damn üò®üò±my jaw lower than my short a of yess hes backwait wait wait wait wait he can essentially borrow skills right what if he borrows incite to turn everyone against the guy who was sending people out in the first placethis story isn‚Äôt exactly one of my favorites rn but it just gets more and more interesting every chapter wtfffsharing is caring kidswhat he meant by being villainü§îholy sh he can like get it üòówell he is like some scrifics for greater goodim with him on this f^ck those guysepic reader is pleased with your decisionmaking yess flying hands all we need to see üòåcome on dokja you could have just lent the guy a handhe continuously tries to make himself the only sacrifice while everyone else can survive damndaamn i love him slay bich slay them allwhat i think he should do is give them coins but only if they give him the survival reward so they all live gain respect for dokja and he also gets his coins backman even tho bihyeong is kinda a ass he gets better on in later scenesfinally a character who is looking out for themselves before other people it‚Äôs refreshing bihyeongthank god i was praying that he didn‚Äôt give the coinskinda reminds me of this situationkids at lunch buy lunch food even thought they sat its badthese guys bought food with their coins both of them still gobble that shit up fast ngl i would do the sameyes i have been waiting for this and im loving it inho sharing is caring dojka shut the fck updat ass i the last panel thodokja isnt a villan per say but hes also not the hero hes just looking to survive in the best way possible so in reality the rules of the jungle apply here survival of the fittest if youre too weak than youll diei know this series is long i predict five seasonsman this is it the plot twist ive been waiting forthis is what i singed up for and the is what i gotüòöüòö

through that guys hands like buttergreedy assholes you take his food and now you want his coins if he doesn‚Äôt give you coins you‚Äôll take his life how much lower can you get i have fallen for yet

to all of those coins when he becomes a ‚Äúmother‚Äù or is murdered by the demon king of whatever and how many people that could have given a chancei knew that bug would be important since it was the

love how he doesn‚Äôt give a care in the world let‚Äôs be honest this is a realistic way of looking at things damn those eye bags tho our poor dokja isn‚Äôt getting enough sleep üòîhe is the goat so

has a bit of sociopathic behavior but he can still function he has the so called onoff switch with realistical adaptable human thinking and moral reasoning if neededoh no hes very pissed offim here and i regret nothingthe constellation hanae_saku liked dokja a lot coins have been awarded i used the free coins earned for an event because i want to support the artist i hope to read moregosh dangit i want more i just fast forward using all my coins and i dont regretno one is good they wanto still moneyi cant wait for more updates ü§©ü§©ü§©im all about the daily uploads i will gladly spend my money for this webtoonbut from what i read this guy is pretty much the line and does who desire to disrupt that line is considered an annoyance i for one respect that is there a new chapter every dayman i really hate praying mantis even as it isinlove yeess we needed this dokja doesnt deserve to take smack from anyone show em whos boss imagine spending all of your weeks worth of lunch money for coins without your parents knowledge i think i messed upi dont remember what the little demon is thats controlling the game but i like the guy i know hes demonic and all but i still like himi like him as a character not the other wayfirst time reader opinions i think dokja is about to learn a new bookmark skill but what would happen if two incite skills clashed interesting to see indeedlove this omgf u f them what makes me the enemy love this twist and realismour protagonist is such a badass i love his reasoning and how he can be so cold sometimesi think im going to reread this webtoon from the very beginning its just so very goodi feel bad at how easily they are corrupted always a great read im definitely hoping you an get funding for a tv showcant stress the notouch policy enough these daysgotta love characters that do what they need to survive and don‚Äôt puss up at every turngetting super tasty lemme see tha da next clup pleaze kind sirwell if theyd actually work harder they would have coins like dokja said they killed someone to stay and why should this be his problem go boy chop chopthe constellation greedy storyarc devourer alpha thinksdikja should buy the peoples loyalty if they want coins he should get something in return the constellation greedy storyarc devourer alpha thinks dokja should go ahead and kill that dudeis this still going to update daily this mights just be me but im begging you to keep it that waywow thats cool the blooded dont dokija but it is the bosses followed because hes just being a prickthis sword is so epicbased neutral oh i love dokjathe crowd is about to turn on the people who sold the food for triple the amount im glad dokja isnt a pussy idiot mcyes dokja god i love dokja this was amazing im thrilled i love thiss story now that is what i call chaotic good üòàset the tone dok clear out the useless extras and then get onto the villainsyes dokja defend yourselfsheesh dude aint playin no games with yallthe dude in the red at the end looks like he shat himselfomg this man just went sicko mode so beautiful there deadyoobeautiful so god damn beautiful damn bro dokja turning hella sick nowi really love how many twist and turns this story takes but when dokja goes cold face he says f those twist and turns ones desire to live should never delve to the depths of unnecessary violence applaud the player for their insight and not blame their ability to do well when others flounderidk what webtoon i love more this or the gamertake my money but in a serious note who can blame him or the people it‚Äôs about to go down üëÄi greatly approve of dokja our mc right now i mean he still has the moral high ground most of those people are there because they killed someone and still refuse to be responsible for their own lives or actions why should he help them it would actually be pointless since they wouldnt learn anything morally the right action is to let them suffer the consequences for their choices so that if they survive maybe theyll change on their owni would like a psycho mc hehe am getting tired of the good and cringey onesim so glad dokja doesnt have the saviour complex that most mcs tend to have dthiss i mean i dont like the character who always been taken advantage by others i love how he isnt a very morally goody shoeshes like its an apocalypse frick u toomy spirit animal kim dokjaü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§i love not morally good protagonists dokja has such an amazing characteri just wanna say i love you all so much thank you for creating this webtoon ugh i‚Äôm so glad dokja isn‚Äôt a pushover and won‚Äôt just do whatever benefits everyone else also hes so coolnice mc vibesi hope that this doesn‚Äôt have any smart clever outcome and dokja just butchers all the fools who thinks he owes them anything dokja is so woke üëçdokja and his gang are the ppl i wanna hang out with i love me a morally grey character this is the definition of ‚ú®let your inner demon shineee‚ú®the audacity of these people is rlly out of hand you ate his food that he risked his life for youve done n o t h i n g at all youre not entitled to his helpthis guy is the definition of virtue signalingyeah you tell em kdj fricking idiots xdauthor nim youre the bestyes this is a realistic character why did i wait so long to read this loving the antihero twist other than the pushover mcsim sorry but thats hotdokja is turning out to be the anti hero type hes good but he will kill if he has todokja is more and more reminding me of sung jin woohahahahahah hahahahhahahaahahhaahhahahhaahahahahaahahhaathat character who got his arms cut off surprised pikachu faceoverhaul i know how that feelshippity hoppity my coins are your propertyumm that was hot ü•µ a whole new meaning of disarming your enemysometimes being a villain is far better than being a hero üòèüòèwoa some people in these comments genuinely scare me where is your humanity why are so many people so happy the mc might not be a good guy when did being a good person become boring if this was a real scenario and you genuinely wouldnt help people when you could at least the children in this crowd then idk what to say but you need to think about what kind of person you are damn papi you a rare breedhah this is why i absolutely love coldquiet people they al always have an interesting instinct being a villain is better than hero in my perspectiveever protagonists says ‚Äúhow pathetic‚Äù in a scary way with there pupil dilated i dont think i have ever loved a mc more than i love him i truly hate self righteous mcsat first i was like mhmm ‚Äúmen with swords‚Äù as a joke but bro i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a joke anymore üò´love how he reacted this webtoon is amazing through all but the mc makes it times better the world they live in is twisted i know but the mc is right for many reasons im seriously going to start crushing on himdokja reminds me of khun from tower of godi love that it‚Äôs not your typical righteous protagonist give me some realityidk about anyone else but i was like finally my godddgreatt character development so realistic and not idealistic tbh i would prob do the same being a good person is cool now but in a situation like that it‚Äôs jst being weak it‚Äôs jst letting others manipulate u for personal gain at that point i would sorta jst be like ‚Äúfuck it‚Äùyes finally a character whos not a bitch this is why i loved solo levelingfinally he is all out of mercynice i like that they are just evilhe has every right not to give them coins they killed ppl he can use that as an excuse if he doesn‚Äôt wanna seem evil cuz he killed bugsi think children at least deserve your help but at the end its a survival of the fittest scenario not a charitymost of the people there killed other people to survive so why should he give coinsi like the way dojka just helps people that actually does need it and i honestly love the way he is not stick on being the good ass guy but instead a fair one literally loving itdokja doesnt take shit and i love it so much pathetic humansused all their coins and blame someone else for their stupidity trash deserves to be destroyedits the apocalypse my dudes ahhi stand by dokjahe is doing the right thing i dont see these people doing anything to live other than just surviving theres a big difference they took human life to get where they are now coins each thats more nights of life or instead of squatting they could you know work on the scenarios at hand üôÑ dokja is taking the moral high

try to kill me for trying to keep you from another‚Äôs clutches gotta show some fear to be respected sometimes needy people sharing is caring me im not a care bear üíúim personally just annoyed of the finally protagonist that does something morally questionable as if every protagonist of these types of stories werent some sort of anti heroes who everytime they do something morally righteous they are like nah nah im doing this definitely for selfish reasonslike not crapping on peoples tastes here im just confused if they really dont realize that majority of web novel series have similar protagonists to here or make choice seem less edgy lateri dont disagree with dokjas choice but couldnt he have said that mr han has more momey than him even if its a lieü§îi hate how the main character is slowly turning into a psycho i really pains methis is a lesson on why socialism is doodoogee ive never had top comment trump is like the dokkaebi making rules that cost lives lots of people will dieso wait if he lets everyone have a bite of the food wouldnt that complete the scenario for everyone so they wouldnt all lose coins unless im missing a stepi really appreciate that hes not willing to get pushed around thoughhe is kind of a bitch dont like him for looking down on those people just because he got lucky and happend to read the right story he wouldve been on their place if he didnt well no actually he would be dead from that edgeguy from the train i dont mean he should give his money to everyone but at least dont be a brat thinking they all deserved that maybe they killed insects too who knowshes lee gilyeong not gilyeong lee why you do this its korean webcomic why the names are written like in eu or america dud this shit just annoys meseriously a episode pay

this is total garb_ age i mean come on just kill the sk m already & those r_ tards as well gods sakedojka seems kind of hypocritical to me he helps out only the people he knows he even helps that little boy but when there is another child that needs coins to survive he turns a blind eye i get not giving coins to the other people but at least for childrenthe thing is that author intentionally made those plain people become evil and start blaming him so he can keep looking down on them but not all are like that and in real life there would probably be more people just crying or begging then stratight attacking him so i find him a total bitch for being that arrogant he couldve done something for example really share coins with the rest who didnt attack him it wouldnt be much at all and he would probaby get even more as donation for his deedhe couldve killed the major group and gave their coins to those in need totally so fck this mc hypocrite or he coudlve at least tried to do smth maybe he will in next chapter but i doubtcharacter i have black hair commenter his hair is black whiner omg how dare you spoil it do you all realize how ridiculous you sound when you whine about spoiling have none of you ever read a book ex harry potter then find out it gets made into a movie and be excited for it anyways even though you already know everything that happens from beginning to end like seriously spoilers dont actually spoil anything you still enjoy the the cartoonmovie get the hell over yourselvesplease don‚Äôt speak in absolutes i don‚Äôt think the story progressed far enough you‚Äôve given us yoo the main protagonist given broken faith a buff then gave it to the reader and you giving the a powerful judge power to jung slow down and progress the story it will just become a story of absolutes and we don‚Äôt even know his goals or what striving for this will just be like a meaningless power fantasy in sea of trash power fantasies\n"

      "Im happy with this twist im sick of characters who try so hard to stick to the moral high ground im really interested to see dokjas developement at this point since hes clearly not going to be a good character i dont think hell be straight up evil but im excited to see the extent of his neutrality at the very least the people sharing is caring dokja i dont care  edit just to clarify i dont disagree with dokjas decision i just thought it was funny how people were trying to get him to maintain a high moral ground but he was just like nah this an apocalypse my dudesfinally a mc that makes the most optimal choice ive been getting bored of mcs always trying to be the herofor real though aside from the people dokja originally saved with the bugs everyone is a murderer they have a lot of audacity to be begging for their lives im down with dokjas pragmatismwait i just noticed look at the panel when dokja cuts the guys arms you see that he is facing away from his group then look at the last panel you can see that he has his back now turned to the guy whose arms he cut off and his body is facing towards his group so that means that this man just cut the guys arms off turned around and then look over his shoulder to flex on all these people xdthis really is gonna be the best webtoon on the app and if they end up making an anime adaption you know itll go crazyi really like the approach to an antihero type of character its nice to see someone who is intelligent but doesnt magically make all the right decisions it makes him seem really human mostly fending for himself great work author please keep it up them gimme coinsdokja whythem ugh lets just kill him and take the coinsdokja mistake slashthem pikachu surprised facei guess the guy at the end there was disarmed eh ehhlol why didnt he just let everybody know about the k coins the cursed guy with the suit hascrowd give me a refund dokja sorry there is a no refund policy give us coins dokja i missed the part where thats my problem this webtoon along with solo leveling is all i am looking forward to every weekcrowd let me get thatdokja its gone cost you an arm and legthey had time to complete the quest but they where sitting there all that time just crying about it and now its his fault pathetic pretty sure sangah has ariadne as her constellation ariadne is sometimes seen as the goddess of mazes and is credited with giving theseus a ball of string to find his way out of the minotaurs labyrinth i mean that was so iconic from that story it just seems too coincidental i dont know if a japanesekoreanchinese myth involving string exists to provide an alternative i honestly think that his decision is the goodone he needs verification that anyone he gives coins to will at least be able to offer something to him in exchange if they dont then they wouldnt be surviving very long anyways if he helped them it would probably just make them suffer longer with no hope of actually surviving and acclimating to the new world order i mean they couldnt muster coins dokja gets that much as a gift from the constellations all the timethe first theme being original sin would that mean the second theme is survival of the fittest he wouldnt be doing any of them a favor by handing out coins for free as they would be bound to the other guy they would rather take the easy path and just kill him when all they really need to do is offer either an item of their own or their services in future runs its how society is supposed to work in the grand scheme of things where all parties work at their own pace to contribute manager dude got k coins last chapter let him save the peoplem i think my favorite constellation is the secret plotterhes right he worked for his coins even with his knowledge he still had to accomplish those things to get an award this webtoon touches a lot of areas in society and its great thank you author for amazing comic i think the facts come down too no one has a moral high ground here like he said original sin they all murdered someone to be alive right now so the fact they expect some one to save them after that is ludicrous no one is good or evil here its just survival for survivals sakedokja is also not dokja i believe he is the omniscient reader otherwise he would cling to humanity and sins for example he would had tried to save as many people as possible but instead decided to let them choose their fates he knows what to do and how to do it instead of morals he thinks with the most logic very interesting and also very hard to stay on that path having the ability of the fourth wall also helped in move forward resistant to fear charm taunts very powerful indeedhe made a good point they all killed someone to get pass the first scenario even that little kid so if you dont take care of yourself then you dont deserve to live money grabbers jesus fcking christ the audacity of those assholesi cant wait to see inho cheon get whats coming to him  gonna be even more satisfying than watching little han boy become a mother edit these arent spoilers this is just what i hope happensthrow myeongeh under the bus hes got coins nowi love it when the main character doesnt stick to moral values like theyre in the apocalypse and they expect people to still follow the moral code even tho most if not all of then already killed someone i love love love dokjas character i am incredibly sick of good characters that make stupid decisions because its the right thing to do im fed up with the moral high ground obviously hes not a bad guy either hes just selfish and i dont find anything wrong with placing your survival first he is not responsible for these peoplejean henri fabre was a french naturalist in the late s known for his books on the lives of insects if anyones curiousis it just me or does dokja get hotter with each passing episode i love how he looks i love how he doesnt take bull look at him hes one of the many reasons why my standards are skyrocketinggod im already so spoiled with this one episode a day lol easily my top series cant wait for morei think the important thing here is regardless of whether or not sharing coins is the moral thing dokja not letting himself be manipulated is better in the long run leaving a mob under incites control will only hurt him in the end not to mention giving those coins would be like taking responsibility for those lives its too much for anyone to really bare people are saying that he wasnt keeping a moral high ground or that the people were telling him to keep a moral high ground and he wouldnt but i think that hes still got a moral high ground these people the moment they were manipulated or had to think things through resorted to murder and thats exactly what he expected of them so why give them coins why trust them i think that despite his looks saying neutral chaotic with evil its more like lawful chaotic with a moral compassi see dokja as a survivor not good or bad just trying to livefinally this mc action makes sense in an apocalyptic world hes not bad but smarti love how they try to attack him he fights back and their expression is surprised pikachu face i dont seem to follow why people have been saying this makes them evil they threw their own lives away unable to beat their inner fear and even attempt to survive it would be a waste to save someone like that in fact id say saving them just to force them into more suffering would be the evil choice if they are unable to even try and survive for themselves why not just let their suffering end it seems cruel on the surface but dokjas got a point in not being too generous people who live passively and allow themselves to get manipulated by relying on charity and sponsorships wont survive if their supporters suddenly decide to leave them be its true in the scenario and in this reality toodokja is not the protagonist of twsa so he will have to take hard and clever decisions in order to survive this game till the endand its much more fun to see him not following the moral valueshe really does look like a villain in that lase slide its so awesome no wonder the constellations are interested in him coins just means youre alive one more day to beg for even more coins itd be a waste hopefully dokja mentions boss mans moniesalso i love he gave hyunsung lee a shield and lee loves him now theyre bros gotta max out that affinitydokja an actually good main characterseriously as if hes some high level monster that you can defeat and hell just drop coins why dont they just break some pottery and pray for rupees do they deserve my help its an important question he cant be expected to shoulder the weight of all these people through the whole apocalypse at some point they need to stand up for themselvesi love how the author sets dokja apart while inho says return the coins to the people it sounds like he is doing it for the good of the people and dokjas and if i refuse sounds villainess but hes the main character and its refreshing that he isnt a morally bound person but at the same time hasnt tipped too far off that has left him insane in this situation this is absolutely one of my favorite webtoons by far and i rarely read anything other than heartwarming and romantic webtoonsfirst they wanted free food next they were too scared to help him kill the giant rats for coins third when they came back they asked for free coins thinking that he would give after that they tried to kill him and expected him to be a sitting duck finally they have the audacity to be surprised that he sliced someones arms offhonestly i love dokjas character hes rational and doesnt let his emotions take the reins over his decisions hes the embodiment of someone going against the worlds corruption while not utilizing the common good prevails trope im % looking forward to his journeyhyunsung lee has started to trust youdokja hmmm i can use thisi agree with dokja theres no reason for him to help these people specially in the situation theyre inthe mc did the right decision because if they can survive just that one scenario how will they survive the next one those people is so pathetic the mc help them for food then they will blamed him for losing of coinsi dont need sleep i need the next episodeyay a gray area characterpeople who rely on others too much usually drag down the whole group because they always expect you to save them and feed of the kindness of others in a survival situation you have to either drag them with you and risk getting the whole squad killed or you have to leave them behind to save those who are able to stand alone i think dokja made the right decision because it would mean hed have to take care of a bunch of people even in the future that is not a longterm solutioni feel like dokja is more rational than evil as people are saying he makes smart decisions and calls based on logic everybody is talking about the moral high ground and how hes evil when mans is making rational decisions and being smart hes neither good nor evil hes j a guy with a rational mindthis comics unreleased episodes are starting to make me agree with coins are poweri love dokjas personality in my opinion he is correct this is the apocalypse and he isnt obliged to help everyone everyone brought food because they were hungry its their own decision what does dokja have to do with it if they wanted coins earn it themselves its every man for themselves i love this author already theyre the first to actually show you when the veil of civilization is torn apart by apocalypse even after murdering another person to survive these people are acting dependant on others if they dont fend for themselves no one will fight for them anymore beautiful storytellingthats one the the reasons i really like this story the mc is quite different from the standar hero  ill support him as far as he dont betray his team dam i caught up to quickly again im so happy thats hes releasing quickly and with great quality ill keep spending coins as long as they keep coming people i know that there are some people who came here from the webnovel but for those of us who are reading it for thw first time on webtoon dont google anything about omnimicent reader because it will just most likely spoil the manwha for you like it did for meedit did anyone else love hyeonseongs face when he was holding the shieldthis is absolutely perfect dokja maintains logical thinking in a time where it would be necissary to do so so it actually makes sense he isnt a hero just a guy a lucky guy but a guy nonethelessnone of you can say that dokja isnt good he doesnt do bad things he just does what is needed to survive moral ground wont work in apocalyptic world he didnt use them he just simply did what was best for him so i really like his decisiondokja badassdokja in the end of the story fucking badasswell this is real interesting dokja is a unique protagonist and i absolutely love italthough those background characters are hella annoying for being hypocrites their reactions and actions are all natural i mean who did expect this to happen not even dokja dokja is lucky enough to have knowledge about the overall situation also its understandable as to why theyre afraid to go out for the quest i mean their families and friends didnt come back after they joined something like that true neutral character coming throughas a mother i say kill the greedy bastards and save the children but as a lover of apocalypse stories the kids would get him killedi am now a simp for dokja they only show interest in dokja when they need something from him why should he share his coins with them he made the right call you have me hooked dokjas decision really gave a sense of reality to the comic most would make their characters be the good guy stick to morals and would give themselves to save others dokja is a very rational character and i am excited to see where his story leads him y did i have the biggest smile on my face when he said y should i give u any am i psychodokja really takes no ones shit and i think thats what makes him such an awesome protagonist like yeah its cruel but considering the circumstances hes got every right to refuse no one else has done anything that deserves his help its survival of the fittest people are bound to show their ugly sides no matter whatif i was one of the people there i would be desperate and honestly feel some resentment towards dokja but id also understand that he very much risked his life to get the food and coins he has and i dont have the right to demand him to give me some especially if i havent even tried to risk my life to get them myself so i understand if they feel frustrated but it should be more with themselves and the situation what dokjas doing is perfectly fine and realisticabsolutely love this antihero what a fresh twist looking forward to the lack of romance and high action packed chapter to followi love him hes not evil just logical and fairtheyre all using scrap metal bats tools and pipes as weapons with some waving bone weapons as the highest thing there and this mf pulls out a swordhe risked his own life to get the food of course he is not going to give it all out for freei like a lot dokja just because hes not pretend to be like the hero or something like that hes just acting like the situation are and the instinct of survive the womans constellation has to be ariadne right like with the whole thread to get out of the dungeon thing is kinda like her and the labyrinth i mean why should he give them coins when they are threatening him i was wondering how they were going to portray the dokkaebi chat i must say i am thoroughly pleased i love the emoticons this webtoon is so amazing the art is some of the best ive ever seen it is so well done i love it the plot is awesome i normally dont like apocalypsethemed stories but this is amazing the characters are fantastic too especially dokja i love how realistic they all are i can tell how hard the authors worked on this and they did truly some of the best work ive ever seen well donedokja me too give me just coins to know what happens next in the story and then give me more and then more and then more then i will pay you back please i just want to see more of your surprising and amazing intellegence and decisions second later rip my arms god i wanna read more why cant this series just be over so i can binge it i love that hes not a hero i get tired of all the high morals and instead hes a survivor this comic is amazing whats the old saying about jesus give a man a fish he will that day teach a man how to fish he will eat every day giving them coins doesnt solve the issue because what about the next day and day after that theyll need someone to help them rather help themselves these people complain about morality but dont hesitate to kill people for coins at leat dokjas transparent they all knew about the survival fee yet they still bought so much food that they didnt have any left for the fee now correct me if im wrong but didnt you get coins for clearing the first situation they had enough coins there alone to survive two days but they bought large quantities of food in order to have it now doesnt that sound like the sloth and fox sin gluttony and greed screw them dokja is definitely doing the right thing its funny how those people went from pleading for dokjas help to being completely hostile towards him talk about true colors huhunrelated but i swear to god i am screaming about this little boy gilyeong i love you so damn much i dont know what it is but something about him has just stuck in my heart since the beginning and every reaction with dokja just makes my head spin the big brother vibes are killing mehonestly its messed up that theyre all so dependent of dokja since he has the food and the coins like damn if yall want some then stop sitting around and get some yourself survival of the fittest and wisest am i right if your kid doesnt have enough coins or food stop babying himher and teach them to survive not to depend on othersdude is a true capitalistdokja is such a badassin an apocalypse there could have been no better choiceleshgoo im so glad hes not your typical hero he has his own sense of neutrality nd i love that damn it why is he so hotpeople can hate dokja all they wanti still think hes bae damndokja is  ah yes this is the type of mc i like y didnt he say that guy with the glasses have coin just ask himhes using like a mythical max level weapon on level villagers i love how people were trying to guilt him using morals and then literally two seconds later tried to kill himomniscient reader is the best thing on this universe i completely understand why he chose to do that if he wouldve chosen to give his coins out most of the people would die anyway and he wouldve wasted coins for no reason leaving him with way less coinsits funny how the same people willing to kill to survive are the same ones that ask for coins to survive like get your crazy ideas that world revolves around you under control dokja aint at fault for the fact u domt have survival fee after all u did was sit on your asses and wait for someone else to take care of youi really like where this is headed so many stories have the main character stick to the typical hero plot which theres nothing wrong with because it always makes a good story but i really like how different this is its a way more accurate portrayal of the chaos and the human desire to survive people really wouldnt be generous in this scenario it really is a fantastic depiction of survival of the fittestthe reason wednesdays exist omniscient readerdokja just became one of my favourite mcsi like this so much i didnt think he was going to kill someone but you got to do what you gotta do and its not some game this is actual survival you already payed for the food so no refunds this is a game of survival and you must think wisely i think everyone can agree its so refreshing to have a character who cares about others but also knows to look after themself first cant wait to see how it develops further thank you author keep up the great workdokjas character is whats lacking in solo leveling limits i rly rly like dokjams character the whole series i believe is a gem that needs to be caressed slowly great job author hope it continues to prosper im a caring person but im siding with dokja they dont see that they allowed this situation and are still being manipulatedwhy do i feel like dojka is going to turn into a nuetural good charactercan i just say that sword is real nice dokja sold food for $ while inho sold his food for more why should dokja be responsible for all these people lifes if he isnt even part of the group if inho the leader shouldnt he be responsible for everyone people can lie about how much coins they actually have people already knew about this coin system early so shouldnt they have been responsible with their moneylook our favorite dokkaebi is backits not that he doesnt care at all he just knows that he needs those coins to survive later because he knows the relative future it is his life over others so obviously he has to choose himself no one is going to pay him back laterhyeonseong lee is the type of guy that would never cheat on you another thing i love about this is that his group stays by him they understand that he doesnt owe these people anything and hes not a bad person for refusing to give them food and money im glad that they arent falling for any of itdokja has made his way to my top favorite badass manhwa characters sitting at # right behind sung jin woothis doesnt make him evil or even neutral as he points out no one here is good and hes resisting the evil manipulation of the incite powerlook ma no handswhy are people trying to get refunds for the food that they already ate lmao im with dokja you foolshow can they ask for a refund after they have already eaten the foodi stan dokja its not on him to save everyone do you boo boohe really just said dont touch me or my family at the last scenedaammnnn this is the character ive been looking fooorrr oh sweetcheese dokja imma go marry youdokja is smart as hellgosh that kid is quite op oh cool sangah have some useful skill too woah so dokja can now collect information on the target character omg the cute evil dokkaebi bihyeong is back oh so the dokkaebi can use telepathy with dokja thats interesting lol the soldier hyeonsyeong is happy with his shield bruh this annoying guy again yes im waiting for you to make your decision too dokja deym he went full cold psycho thats so awesome he even cut that guys arm off clean im so proud of youits is time ladies and gentlemen this is what i call sweet fucking satisfaction everyone is like oh he doesnt have morals but thats not true his morality is just different in an alignment chart he would be lawful neutral possibly lawful good compared to everyone else he doesnt believe in giving away things for free the people could offer him something and he would probably agree that doesnt make him morallesshonestly dokjas character development really resonates with me if i have been put at the edge of my lifes cliff numerous times hanging on with my teeth id be sick and tired of peoples shit toooh my dokja is so jfjdhskfhdjebdjdndj     yes yes dokja worked so hard for his coins and he is without any sponsor why should he give them just because they think he shouldnt let them die they killed people without problem to survive the first scenario wtf he is hero for his friend and villain for others i love it  i love this types of character thank god hes not like other main characters  dude hes so cool t^t is intrigued by dokjas choicesnnoo i read all the episodes this is one of those ones where they should make into a showyo i think dokja made the right decision its an apocalypse and he has his own to care for plus how many of those people would give up their coins if they were in his situation im pretty sure none of them would its literally the apocalypse you live on by every decision you make and being nice isnt going to keep you alive forever dokja did the right thing im honestly in love with dokjas characterdokja in the beginning of the webtoonim not smart or handsomedokja right now is the most attractive character everi smell anti hero development and im here for itdokja has shown us hes considerate but hes not a pushover either when this is your th time reading the comic and it still hasnt gotten oldwell if he would not have sold them food they would be already dead im % with dokja in this why the hell he has to share his coins just because some random dude ask you lmao tbh ill do the same he doesnt have the responsibility for others lifes only for his own survival dokja is one of the best mc ive seen in a while love the line about the killing in the first triallike youre capable of premeditated murder but not to take care of yourself you dont even have to do everything alone you can team up if they didnt just stay in one place roughly % of them would be able to survivehonestly i would have behaved like that too dokja is not selfish just because he isnt being blindly selfless he is strategic because this world is all about survivali love how hes not our typical hero and is a human to be honest if i was in his position i probably wouldnt help them either its a dog eat dog world only the fittest will survive every man for himselfi like how he refuse he earn the coins with hard work and good thinking while those people are desperate to survive but they dont think outside of the box like dokia in the first scenariodokja is good and evilyes mess them up do not i repeat do not let this sick ass bastered get away with thisits literally not his fault its like attack a stranger because they didnt want to help you with your problems its your life to deal with dokja is such a refreshing main character i feel like most mains are usually true good or true evil but so far id say hes pretty neutral hes so interesting and unpredictabledick leader hey bro dont you have the most coins everyone communism intensifieshonestly im happy protagonists should focus on their own survival its not realistic to expect someone to sacrifice themselves for a bunch of strangers not to mention ones who have killed innocents to survive forget morality this is spartathanks author how is this comic not popular you need to be appreciated author nice decision he worked hard for those coins those people shouldve worked for coins when they clearly had the chance not leeching of someone elses coins it is also not even his fault that they dont have coins from not using it wisely so honestly dont give me that shit  fuck i love dokja sm i think dokja is doing the right thing even if the other people think he is being selfish in a survival scenario you cant depend on others to save you the incite guy is banking on dokjas morality forcing him to play nice but survival is the goal not being likedariadne was a princess who gave someone theseus or daedalus i think her magical thread for them to escape a labyrinth im a super greek mythology geek so my theory is sangahs constellation might be ariadne or something its funny how they blame dokja for everything like did he forces you to buy the food or what dokja ill give you the coins back if you can undigest all that food you bought from mehe handled that nicelyits funny how similar this is to real capitalism people always seem to demonize people with money because there are needy out there and thus try to take their money through various means just a connection my brain madeoh shi turned him into overhaul pacifism is a point of weakness in a world where everyone has already killedive never bought any coins or tried to on this app but this story not only made to buy and look for coins but also the only one for which i use all those coins and thats saying something no sorry a lotttbtw i just love dokjas character the right balance of good and evil he knows when to be good and when not to be he doesnt follow common guide lines or general society morals which are dubious at times like thesei read it in the novel but i still get irritated and upset with this scene kim dokja may sound selfish but everyone else needs to be responsible for their own lives giving them fish for today wont help them tomorrow ironically i have ran out of coins so now i have to waitthe constellation the reader of a thousand webtoons gives dokja a bro fist of approvalare you jeanhenri fabre or something bahahahahahaha amazing aslal is really interested in every decision dokja make she has become a fan of yours heres your five coin bro we all just people spending money to read will we all heard this qoute if you make this a game ill show you how its played thats how exactly how he manage to not keep going to his game plan i love it and im still willing to waste more coinsstrong escanor vibes^^well at least this webtoon is close to reality in terms of attitudeim done with hypocrite characters so always have those high values that sometimes it doesnt feel real at all i cannot express how much i love protagonists like dojka a persons bound to get tired of mary sues at some point i love moral grey points in post apocalypse i hate seeing the goody twoshoes in these situations its literally kill or be killed everyone there has taken a life so they dont deserve true sympathyall yall getting heated in the comments coz dokja aint fit your standards of high morality theyre all murderes lmao dokja raised a very good point on they cant even take responsibility for their own lives so why would dokja be responsible for their lives yes it would be kind and generous of dokja if hes willing to give it to them for free but for him this is survival of the fittest and he earned those big money because of his smart thinkingstrategy he has the right to refuse as selfish and cruel as it sounds them trying to leech on him forcibly and badmouthing him when they arent evenbe nice and give these murderers you dont even know some of your life line and risk you and your own groups safety and survival to make these people who just sit in a corner till someone comes whom they can leech off on survive hours then leech off on you again next time cuz youre nice yeah sure no shtpff to be completely honest i wouldve been worse in dokjas situation like i dont know why i should save them i dont mind being called the villain i just protect those people i value and im not about to risk nor sacrifice the chances of our survival to murderers i barely knowi love it when the mc is neither a hero or a villainbro wjy is he so hotim beginning to like this man i think im in love right now i would just mention that this fella right here killed a demon and got coins as reward so one of your men now has enough coins to save everyone sheesshhh mah guy turn to erenok but bihyeong was so cute in that one panel xddhe watched his own hands wave him goodbye  i might sound wicked but i really liked how he reacted im still not done reading the novel but dang i love dokjas character so much but once again none of these people tried to hunt monsters and complete the task like bruh theyre just a bunch of leeches and the spirit said that coins will be drawn daily even if they had it for the night they wouldnt have any for the next night and they still wouldnt try to go kill monstersrn my favorite constellation is prisoner of the golden headbandthat moment when u are done playing the good guy routethis is definitely an interesting scenario nice to see bihyeong again toochaotic neutral lol well hes not evil bc all of these people are murderers too lol even worse theyre entitled ones who did it wo thinking in the first taskdokja is really right i mean they taken someone elses life for their survival and now they arent ready with their life to be taken thats so ridiculous lol dokjas a chaotic neutral typehe is being realistic tho im sick of mc who is always trying to be goody two shoes its an apocalypse who tf in their right mind would want to help others lets be reali think dokja is a complex morally grey character i like those typesam i the only one having a deja vu of kirito from saoits their fault that they dont have coins leeching off of other people and then blaming a guy who worked hard for his coins no thanks theyre just pretending to have a high morality high morality yet illogical  buzzing excuses without even thinking justice should be served who cares about morality when its about your survival feels good to see a mc that doesnt want to be a hero all the timei want a refund bruh youre saying you want to uneat food you yourself had chosen to survive by tf lmaomorally grey characters are the most interesting imo im interested to see how dokjas personality and choices influence the original storygod mode has been activated that dude deserved it tbh that sword just cut through flesh ligaments veins and fricking bones in just one clean slice thats literally impossible its an upswing toohyeongsong lee is so damnnn dokja is seeming to be more malevolent now even the art is making him look evil wonder if his allies will keep supporting him though they didnt seem like theyd want to share their coins either sangah seems reminiscent of ariadne from the greek myths so im wondering where shell stand tooeven the constellations were speechless holy shit this is so refreshingdokjas principles  that was hotwow i think hes going to be an anti hero i love how he cut off that guys arms with hesitation these peoples hypocrisy is just so real to me if ever this apocalypse happens the audacity to be guilt tripping someone to greed over their lives when that persons already trying to survive himself too you have been gifted coinsi just like how much he fking loves his new shield yes an mc that doesnt stick to the morals help everyone also they know what theyre doing with the cliffhangers lmaoaoaogive me your hard earned coins so i can survive i dont deserve to die did you kill another human being to get here um yes then screw off brohe arms wentyeet these people are the most unreliable if he helped them now then later they would probably betray him when the odds are against him dokja is seriously my number character and development i agree damn well with his choices i would do the same its the apocalypse not a guy begging on the street i dont mean that rudely btwi love this because he just stick to surviving thats all sure he may be doing some wrongs but also some right he is more balance if anything i dig dokja hes more in a grey area instead of being a goodytwoshoes a lot of protagonist with his powers and knowledge would use them too much and create more problems for themselves im glad a lot of webtoons seems to promote this kind of less predictable protagonistdokjas face expressions coupled with his black shirt was really hot dokja is against communism dokja isnt a hero nor is he a villain hes a survivor doing whatever it takes to live and give the people he cares about the opportunity to survive without taking care of themyou know what i think he is making the right decision its there fault for being greedy love the twist btwafter reading this comic my eyes are still shining from excitement  think about it those people are getting what they deservedokja is the most fair of all them it may seem a little too drastic but giving that people coins would be like giving thousands of money to murderers bc of the first scenario im so happy there is finally a character that dont care about what the others think that is fair and trust on their own point of viewdokjamy guyi simp for youi just wanted you to knowi definitely love dokja being a real one giving coins to everyone doesnt help anybody what a masterpiece of a webtoon the last panel was literal fire dokjas squad are preparing to destroy those idiotsthis webtoon is so much like the novel such a loyal recreation so fardokja nah frick you i have excaliburthey paid him fairly for food and get mad that he stole his money he just went and got food like any of them couldvethe constellation webtoon fangirl is very intrigued im curious to see how dokjas party thinks of this them ppl thought dokja was pussy  the entitlement of all of them as if he had to help them because why to be a good person please they all sat around on their asses instead of trying to fend for themselves and expect him to give out his resources he earned for free byeee aint his fault since he didnt force you guys to buy the foodshit i love this webtoon i think im addicted to iti like dokjas thinking all those people literally killed other people to make it this far but now act like their the victims at the hands of his mercy if they were ready to kill other people for survival they are responsible for their own survival as well its also unlikely for them to survive anyway if they dont stop to rely on other people and they literally had the choice to either try finishing the scenario or die because of lack of coins the first might have even provided some coinshonestly what are they gonna do to him if he doesnt share in a matter of minutes theyll all be dead anyways soi love his character its real who would want to share his live freely with someone he didnt know survival of the fittest bitch you adapt or you die  me likey  and thats how this became my favorite webtooni love that do you have a death wish or something look at the end dokja doesnt have time for your bs dude here i am the person who read the novel patiently waiting to see kyrgioschaotic neutralwait until you see what he become in the futurewhat i find interesting is that these people who are themselves killers trying to hold dokja to a moral high ground like bishyup inho needs to see he aint the boss and the people need to see that inho has been mooching off of them parents with little kids children women have it rough in scenarios like these but even dokja knows that he needs to cull thieving menaces to be of real help and that dude that got violated by a demon seems to not have learned his lesson either the point is that all the people in this scenario are murders they have killed someone to be in this scenario for them to be asking for coins as if it is the moral thing to do is ridiculous it depends on who actually deserves to be helped sangahs ability reminds me of the legend of theseus and the minotaurim glad the main character is basically saying fck you im tryna survive too aint no charity in these streets this is just life the rich people dont hand out money we work for our coinsi think his point is justifiable he straight up asked why do you deserve his coins prove it get them this is the apocalypse being friends wouldnt help you survive for long to be honest dokja is the type of person who is alone but when it comes to lifethreatening situations he would do anything and help anyone if it benefits him as well the type of people dokja is helping are the type to giveandtake they are all compatible in there small group that dokja made they help each other out on the other hand inho cheon who dont give any fs and use other people i would also like to see inho cheon face when that man hands got cut of by dokjaalso dokja legit is getting food and this is what they do the respect he might point out that the got who killed the monster has coins and that the guy leading them didnt seem worried so he must have plenty of coins to sparedear santa please give me coins so i can read the next chapter i promise ill be good remember people to heart this chapter lets appreciate the characters uniqueness killin old ladies one moment and begging for mercy the next naaww bruhs im good ah chaotic good i am familiar them give us our coins back dokja \\__ survival of the fittest \\__dokja is looking out for his newly formed family notice how he was telling his new kid brother not to use his ability until he tells him to or how he lets the girl know not to tell anybody about her contract or how he got a shield for his buddy it seems to me hes looking out not just for himself but his friends oh and love the back and forth with the dokabilmao i just realized something coins are the most powerful thing in that world and this is the same for us people who have enough coins can fastpass while us peasants are left to die in boredom and impatience lewlthe moral high ground has no meaning when the first thing you had to do to survive was take another lifehe just had enough of your shitthank you for the realism when your lifes at stake theres no time for a moral high groundhelp me i have a serious thing for dokjai feel like you could never stick to a moral high ground in an apocalyptic universe people are gonna die and you want to survive what you have to do to survive may not he the most morally good thing to do but thats lifei like dokjas way of thinking its not the typical hero personality that hes got but at least he thinks rationally depending on the situation they are in stan dokja did they think theyd survive if it werent for dokja giving them the food what do they think is dokja to them their nanny ofc hes gonna ask you to pay for shit nothing is free in this world nothing i really do love dokjas character to death hes not the usual annoyingly good guy mc and even the protagonist of the story isnt nice theyre human and it shows i love how much this webtoon shows the flaws of us living beings i also would do the same thing hes smart cunning and selfish plus he tells it how it is like why should i give up my coins for yall when that has nothing to do with me he reminds me of myself and i love iti think dokja is a good person he does help people when he can like heewon but theres a line between nice and stupidty he cant just sacrifice himself for everyone else in such an insane world it really forces your true self out of you i like how this mc isnt just gonna blindly follow we must help others sharing is caring~ like many other mcs do another example of an mc i think is similar to dokja in the above stated manner is medea from your throne dokja sure is one hell of an interesting character huhi love how realistic kind of dokja is i mean his personalitydokja had to risk his life in many situations in order to earn that many coins its his right to keep those coins to himself instead of giving it to people that sat around in a safe zone waiting for coins and food while others went out and risked their lives for coins and food okay but seriously how many of them killed to survive the first round only thise who didnt deserve it and honestly survival of the fittest and his friends he and his crew went out and earned those coins they didnt kill a single person eitheridk why people think the protag is evil in the first game he saved the child when he had no reason to and he also saved the woman from the poison when yet again he had no reason to it just so happens that they were useful the child was not in the webtoon that he was reading and the woman was but he had no idea who she wasim just waiting for the constellation secretive plotter to reveal that heshe is the author of twsano shits were givenbro what abt the suit guy he has like coinsthe ad i got at the end of this episode just so happened to be a snickers adself defence moral high ground they took lives why should he save theirs i dunno still pretty high morals and he attacked only when his life was in danger  its not all so black and whitedealing with people is exhausting irl and even in apocalypseare we just gonna ignore hyeongseong lee being adorable after polishing his shieldright if you need coins get them for yourself dokja literally fights everytime while the others just wait for food and coins its an apocalypse i dont like it morally but i do agree with him since he did earn the coins and this is life or death he cant rlly be charitable in this kind of situation yep im addicted ddokja was like nah this an apocalypse not a charity  dokja sometimes is really scary i want a refund huh lol ok karen i want a refund when you ask for a refund you gotta bring back what you bought no then give the food back oh you cant not his problemdude theres literally a survival fee for everyday say dojka gave away all these coins for the people ok and then what he cant do this everyday so theyre going to die anyway like bruh hes not even being evil i played way too much etrian odyssey to not recognize an ariadne thread when i see one ooh what a powerful boy we got therei love grey charactersthat army guy is so cute when he wipe that shield skfjfjsjfjj why am i so into the whole morally grey mc trope  especially when they got that iq  like medea muah chefs kissthings have gotten so interesting i misread have you all been well and saw it have you all been in hellluke skywalker would be proud i love me some psychological warfarethis is survival anything goes if only you hadnt bought excessively then none of this wouldve happened he may look like hes making heartless decisions but its simply survivallol our favorite doakabi is backi mean even if he went full on humanitarian and gave away every single scrap he still couldnt save everyone in rescue training they teach you never to put yourself in a position of unnecessary risk bc youll just increase the number of people needing rescuedsame idea here some degree of selfishness required im satisfied with dokjas decisionmorally grey characters are my weaknesswhy isnt anyone talking about bihyeong he was hilarious and adorable that wink and that totally innocent whistlingso chaotic neutral character niceother readers i love this doods attitude me yay bihyeongs backa character with common sense and isnt an asshole im hooked now dokja is so badass im here for itbruh the kid in the back is lookin just as evil as dokja he like mfer deserved it im kind of happy a little sad that some kids will die but these people cant seem to understand that this world now revolves in a different way and dokja will ride the wavesim glad that dokja didnt give infck that dumb face inho i wanna himi love how this dude really keeps targeting dokjahe doesnt even help them out himself just using their misfortune to manipulate them no more kind dokjai like how dokja has gone from i am a normal person to i am a super genius to why should i give a shit if you live or die over the course of ~ chaptersin a situation where you dont need morals to survive i like that attitudehehhes so hot god i need a minutethe look in his eye is crazy and i love itcheckmate communists yesyesyes yes kill them alli love it when the mc turns evilooo goddamn dokja is becoming a morally grey character someone who isnt good but not baddokja is my new religion honestly i get it why sacrifice for people who leech off of you and kill you the first chance they get the best thing to do while they still had plenty time wouldve been to try to fulfil the scenario with the strongest leading the charge or with inho inspiring the others but unfortunately those in charge are selfish cowards im glad he chooses to be selfish cause for what reason he wanna give them the coins in this time you should save yourself first before save other people yay the little crazy creature is bk and l love dokia face is like a crazy person laughing to himselfthis webtoon is awesome the main character is very progressive and hyper aware of the situation i love it hey uh dokja got cake all these people survived by murdering someone if anything they shouldnt even talk about sharing and having morals i think dokjas decisions are right i think morally he is doing the right thing to survive what about whats his face that received coins for finishing off the demon couldnt he sharei love how dokja thinks fck morals be smart this is why i love antihero main characters am i the only one who laughed when the guy looked back at his falling arms it was funny to me im not sadistic tho lolif this was real life than id probably have to think about my personal morals and the situation a bit before siding with dokja but since this is fiction im satisfied as hell with whats happening right now go dokja dugh man i read it to fast now i have to waitooh yes i love dokja hes one of the best characters ive seen in webtoon so fareveryones gonna forget that coins that evil rich dude got for slaying the monsterwould have been funny if he said that the annoying ex workmate had just won coins just wondering what would have happened then p holy fudge this is the mc that ive been looking forthis has nothing to do with the webtoon but long live the demon kinghes not rude hes just being smart all these ppl would never give him if they hadperiod they would never and we all know that so ya why would he dokja is the one character whos neither too kind and good to be true neither evil and ruthless hes smart and wise its so refreshing to see such a character and well ofc hes climbing up the d best list too quicklyomg make this an animeawooga bark bark grryesss love a good chaotic neutral character i wonder what the backstory of that kid did since the first scenario is to kill an organism i wonder if he killed a person or something else the kid as in one of the womans kidi love it when my main characters go chaotic neutraldid anyone notice huwons traits is about to blossom hope she doesnt become a mass murder like dokja said she mightplease make this an animei like how the authors made clear dokja its not a piece of cake by making him cut both arms of the thug at once no joking aroundi love this i cant even writehe went from zero to badass in secondsill call it as a realistic smart and pratical good character dokja is the epitome of true neutral im really curious to see how his friends are going to react for him doing that in a survival speaking it was a really good choice if your point in that time is to survive then morals and feelings are useless however in a human way of seeing this situation no matter what you tell yourself there is this feeling of morality that tells you what he did was wrong to those persons who are just trying to live and you shouldnt be with him so it becomes a huge psychological conflictdokjas perfect retaliation this is why its one of the top webtoonsthey all asked so nicely for the coins and food before but when hes finally being a little selfish because there his coins they all just try to kill him like dude he gave away all of his food and risked his life to find more and this is what they resort to loloriginal sin i think it refers to the deadly sin pride inho the b@st@rd lust the guys that tryna rape girls by luring them back in the early ep greed them hovering over dokjas food and money sloth them be just sittin there waiting for food wrath inho and the people attacking dokja envy cursed dude envying dokja for its achievements gluttony idkyeah this decision seems logical to me new world new rules even on normal world there is no good people and evil people there is survival your mind own sense od justicethis webtoon is a war between my work together to survive mentality vs my give no shits cause they dont deserve it mentality its getting so fucking goodour coins what i find funny is how they all say they want a refund but they already ate all the fooddokja really said f in the chat to the people who cant pay for it i want dojak to turn the tables besides none of this fee stuff would have happened if greedie boy over there didnt stockpile foodlove when main characters go semi dark in these situationsi really shouldnt be laughing this hard  dokja really is the definition of true neutraldojka in the last panel left me with shivers down my spinei would have turned it around i would have said okay but only if you and your group redistribute your own coins first lets see your status screen and the other search party members and have you pay off as much as possible then i can pay the remainder that should be fair since i havent officially joined this group yet and have been attacked twice already dont delay too long of you want everyone to surviveim eagerly waiting for the next episode dokja is not a hero known for his heart of gold and his bravery hes just another player with a distinct advantage he has intricate knowledge of the game world and he has to use that knowledge wisely im sure he doesnt want people to die but theres no point in killing himself for them so early in the game he might give them a chance if he deems them worthy of joining his party but thats about it dokja is so freaking cool because he is not one of those goodygoody always do whats right and angelic and kind at your own expense kind of character but he is not just a straight up kill everyone and make explosions for no reason but to cause suffering kind of character either it is so amazing and i love itit was the people decision to buy the food in the first place then they crazy cause they dont have the coins to survive anymore tough luck man i think dokja is chaotic neutralhe did the right decision i would of done the same or just not returnyou see those mental gymnastics right there first they blame dokja for all their problems then they expect him to fix their problems and then expect him to just sit their and let them jump him hilarious hahaha the fine line between morality vs justice it may not be morally right to not help those people but they put themselves in that position so it would be unjust to dokja if he were to selflessly sacrifice what he had earned himself its all oh so sweet gotta love dokja my man it isnt morality its justice what have they done to deserve the coins its just stupid the next time they need to pay the fee they wont have any coins because there aren t helping nor going out for supplies btw black shorted hair girl is waifu uwui was getting tired of him playing along for the love of god its the fcking apocalypsei really like this character development unlike other main characters this make apocalypses more realistic i hope dokja knock some sense into those people against inho or even themselves they let themselves get into a position where inhos group has power over them it may not be the best decision for dokja but it may have been a wise oneyes finally an mc in dealing with these kind of scenarios the way i want them too no more playing the hero and saving people who dont need to be saved or will just flip on you at the drop of a dime my god the adrenaline kick from this episode love it anyway i really hope this gang stays as allies hm so dokja is a gray characteri  dont have money  so  ill  wait  lmao  this webtoon is a dopethose peopleare so stupid really he worked hard for it and its not his fault that they didnt get to eat bc it got confiscated and also they didnt huntthey cant just stick or think someone will do things for them to survivethen they have the audacity to ask for coins when all they do is complain best mc everof course those people deserve coins but if theyre all clamoring and running up towards him violently he cant give them to anyone since he doesnt even have enough coins in addition they are only thinking of themselves when doing this trying to attack him saying that he needs to give them coins because they need them more than him because its evil to do otherwise they act out of selfishness so why cant dokja act out of selfishness too this is the apocalypse i badly want an animation of this webtoon i know it will and i cant for itdokja is right all of these people killed someone else to clear the first scenario now why they are asking him for help thats not how you survive fellas you go dokja as long as he is not betraying anyone he is finebihyeong in the background looking adorable and secretly chatting with dokja is precious best thing ever bihyeong is my fave even though hes a cosmic being that basically runs a torture channel ruining lives and hes not actually like a good guy i guess but whatevs he fictional and sometimes lovelyi think he just wants to see who attacks him and help out the restthe satisfaction when undeserving people dont get what they want personal attribute of a badassits nice to have a main character who thinks rationally and makes the right decision i love reading his thoughts because they analyze the situations clearly if they cant take care of their own lives what right did they have to take others anyways even if he gave them coins today they will ask for more tomorrowthis is basically equity vs equality should we all receive the same or should we all achieve the same levelyes thats exactly what i wanted to see this webtoon just climbed up the ranks of my top with a gigantic leapeveryone who is saying dokja is gonna be a bad character kind of person i will say these are his survival tactics if he just agrees to everything other people say then whats the profit in reading twsa he needs to be one of the protagonist that i feelit feels to me like dokja is going to walk a weird sort of moral grey area and apply pressure on both sides to survive i like thisok but suit man has like k coins someone let them knowwhy does he let blond main group leader live he kills for lessthis is totally interesting survival story where moral ground is in conflict with survival of the charactersfinally tbh i would of been done killed someone bro like fr idc let me be the villain that is full and is rich off coins i earned my fair share should of read the book sucks to suck tell on the so called leader that bastardit would have been seriously idiotic if dokja had chosen otherwise usually all the protagonists try to be heroic and hold on to their morals and stuff with the stupid self sacrificing personality but dokja is straightforward legendary and his face in that panel why should i give you any was so badass its nice to have heroes that act selfish once in a while its quite refreshing to see the peoples faces like what but we wasted our money on your food refund im like bruh if you cant return the food in one edible piece why should he give back the coinsyou dont care about him so why would he care about you ohohohohohoits not censoreddokja keeps showing traits of maybe why his destiny chose him to hold more power in the times of apocalypse people deserve love mercy and sharing to prosper together but dokja also knows how to find the true deserving ones when you go to attack someone you should expect them to fight back he has more coins than all of you for a reasonnow this is what a protagonist should bewell frick why does dokja have to be so hot and cool help me pls somebodyyou dont need to set yourself on fire to keep other people warm greedy people just take and take theres no end to it one day its this another its that im glad hes not giving in its rare to see a main character not maintain morals this series is so original and well written and honestly i hope it gets its own animeme who needs coins to feed the next episodewhen u try to roleplay a true neutral pc on dungeons and dragonsfinally a main character who isnt always niceoh i like him more and more why should dokja share his coins if they didnt even earn them everyone literally wants everything for free and its patheticyess a protagonist makes a practical decision he looks dead on the insidehe literally disarmed that guythis was a ratherdisarming episodethread and labyrinth huh i think her sponsor is a greek mythdokja yesss you will not be fooled by that evil manokay but why is the dokkaebi so cutethis webtoon is so amazing i do not regret fast passing lee hyeonseong lee hyunsung whatever spelling your name is lmao you precious bean i wanna protect you with my life i wanna wrap you in a blanket and sing you lullabies this webtoon always makes me coins spendin and im not regretting it aahhh this nigga rawdokja gives a lesson stand up for urself u always gonna be kind to everyone then u gonna get urself killed limit ur kindness ^_^the fact that i have to wait is killing me but this is now my new favorite series fast pass isnt fast enough if you reached the last available episode i like how dokja is a true neutral character not a protagonist but also not a villain he doesnt hurt or help anybody he doesnt have to with exceptions lol and i am excited to see where his character development goes from here finally i feel bad for the guy who got his arm cut off but damn that is one effective way to settle a crowd and get them to listen real quick even if only for a minute it could make all the difference is this man just going to straight up murder the leader damn i hope sovote dokja for most savage man of not even someone just spare me more coins i promise ill pay you back just more to make it to the next scenariowelp now im officially going bankrupt thank you webtoonssharin aint carin in excited to see a well written anti hero these are so hard to cone by these daysi see dokja being a grey area character not necessarily evil but not good either hes just true neutral people kill the man who survived the subway dokja deletes a mans arms please do continue to try if you want to diethats insane hes giving out coins in trade for handsi love dokjathis is not a handy situation its all out of hand and in the palm of chaos but this story is finger licking goodcame to comment on how much i like having a neutral main character but so did everyone else oh boy hes not playing around anymorewhy cant they release two chapters a day they got me fcked up having to wait  also i love homegirl that asked for the sword lol bish has no chill and i love it she is def gun be a bad ass character thatll be me when i stop acting nice to everyone and smilingdokja is right why would he give his coins for them if he gave his coins they will just be thankful at first but the system will collect coins and the cycle will repeat again its % waste he dont even know or owe them theyre parasites and you wouldnt want parasites stick on you and extract all you have until you have noneim not gonna put dokja on a pedestal for cutting the guys forearms off but i will say this is getting pretty interesting slayyy dokja as you shouldhe always think logically i love his characterim so addicted to this webtoonwhat high morality and shit dokja collected all those coins himself he risked his life to get the foods too if anything its those leechesthat went from please give us some of your coins~ to kill him and get his coins from him real quickdokja is just keeping it if they wanted to live they couldve gone out and put the work in instead following a prick who just talks all the damn time dokja earned his coins he owes nothingwhy do they want a refund i mean they bought it and ate iti mean think about it what would happen in the long run its just like that saying you can give a man a fish but you can teach how to fish and hell fish for the rest of his life its not exactly like that but in the future they wont have enough coins either and he cant just keep giving them coins that will get him killedyk i love it when characters drop the good deeds and decide that they dont wanna deal with any of the bs hes also got a point as well and yeah majority of the people were asses anyway who killed to survive in the first scenario but now theyre all going up to dokja and beg him for coins and shit im excited to see where this is going and him slicing the dudes arms man ive never been so satisfiedreally love dokja so much sick and tired of mcs who are like ohhh yeah im a good guy lets share some shit he is like nah bitches not happening lmaodokja believes in justice so hes right to ask why if u have bad intentions why should he helphes so hotthis is why i love dokja if its not just me but why do i feel like dokja is not normal either from the start where he instantly knew how to use his bookmark and hi calm demeanor while facing people deaths its not normal it feels like he knows something but i couldnt explainoh yey ~ theres a difference to logic and morality thats why philosophers always grind their brains with ethics coz they have different values and principles with survival as the main objective being charitable kills even the recipients not just the giverbihyung is back lol but he looks so cuteeven im scared and pleased to his decision its just so good that the author makes the plot twist excitingdokjas decision was realistic idk the right term for that bcs i mean they are all fighting for survival being righteous and kind would actually bring them nowhere or something like that dang i should work on my vocabularyomg im so in love with his attitudethat last panel chillsmc so bad assthis is refreshinghyeongseong is a big softiehahah i like how his arms got chopped off they are saying that he is a bad guy but all of the survivors are bad people for what they have done so they shouldnt even say a person is bad because their is no good peopledokja lookin hot there wtfam i the only one who missed the dokkaebi and thinks its cuteno just me okayok damn that was hothes kinda like a prantagonisti would have just murdered anyone who tried to take the coins no moral high ground in this universe screw you inhothey want to get coins easier than accomplishing the scenariosthe best way to describe dokja is dark heror thought their methods are cruel they always do whats justicethis is exactly what i expected him to do in the previous episode people should learn not to blame others for their errors eren likethis is actually a depiction of the sad reality people will blame you for their own misfortune they will ask you things and if you wont give it to them they will blame you for the things they couldnt attain bc of the loss of that something when in fact they couldve made a way to get that something dokja is so hot grrokay look if he gave them coins just for free like hes not getting anything in return free hes giving them a free pass they will end up just sitting there with their hands outreached waiting for you to put the next thing in their palm they have to earn it even now you have to work for everything so like theyre not just gonna be given a free pass even the child was like im not gonna be useless and got skills to help and actually helped thats not a lack of morals or empathy disarming a grunt with ] has taken and is impressed with the hard decision] i wonder if he could have gained any traction by mentioning the incite ability people hate being manipulated once they know then again that would probably be showing his hand too muchantiheroduhyeah like they killed another person to save themselves and now they want him to save them without any profitwhy should hewhat about the dude with over coins did he diemama got a point though its not his fault youre there okay but why did he seemed so hot like i cant handle one more fictional crushthings are about to get interesting uhonestly they dont have any right to make others stick to morality if they themselves have thrown theirs away also that inciteful fellow is annoying too and im excited to see the tables turndamn i just started reading this for just coins but its so addicting lolhe is starting to get the dripi just want someone to look at me like the tank is looking at his shield maybe its just me trying to justify it but i think when he said something to the effect of they all took a life but couldnt take responsibility for their own he knew most of these people didnt even look for an alternative theyre people who wouldnt help him were their positions reversed not after consideration consciously just out of pure cowardice the way people make excuses not to help others every day when theyre easily in a position todokkaebi communication you mean when you and your friend are in the same room texting each otherre reading this was worth it ahh my cute bihyeong is backkkto be fair he never has stuck to a moral high ground not in the slightest he has been doing everything as if he wasnt actually in the situation himself he is doing everything in order to make the constellations want to pay attention to him fulfilling his end of his contractcame here to get free coins and got a nice webtoon to read winwin situation at its bestthis hole coin situation is kinda funny when i realize im reading this for free coins in the app these idiots they were the ones who were going to steal food from dokja and now their mad because he gave it to themdude dokja tho  get em for some reason my brain sometimes automatically reads dokja as doja cat thank u he same situation happened to me obviously not as dangerous but still i was playing and online game and i traded stuff for a rare item and the next day the girl wanted it back i was like no it was a fair trade if u wanted to keep ur items then dont trade theminteresting a john henry fabre reference i highly recommend his book on entomological science the insect world its such a fun book aye why is that mf mr han siding with the other guy after all that hardship dokja went through to save him damn hes so badass give me some dokkaebi plushie pleasegilyeong lools like the child of dojka and the brown haired woman that has the same colored has as gilyeong sorry if im spwlling it wrongoohh im excited to see where this goes love the change of his mood humans are so pathetic just blaming someone else always he giving off that bad bitch energy i love this story so damm much ughthat last pannel scares the hell outta medokja is about to be the ultimate grey area lolllfkki like this side mci think dokja is doing the right thing if you want to survive an apocalypse you dont really try to protect everyone around you this isnt a game its life survival of the fittest my dudesfrankly when trying to survive you can only look after yourself and your loved ones in good times or bad you can share what you can but if i had myself to look after i would be the same and im a really giving person you gotta be smart and dokja isso glad the mc isnt a generic trash that tries to have a moral high groundi fucking love dokja hes one of the best mc out there he sees no need in having a high moral ground its a damn apocalypsei literally love this character its ok to be badi like how both dokja and the station ppl are to blame for their situation right now the reason theyve run out of coins is bc they gave it to dokja and now everyone is pointing fingers at him its a kindness of dokja to even think of sharing his food to them this webtoon is just amazing cant wait to read moreyeeaahh lets goi meani wouldve done the samelike dude you aint gonna remember me tomorrow for what i do today when you were already up with a rod to kill me nowive decided since im a six foot six giant in real life my constellation will be named giant of moralityim enjoying the fact dokja isnt falling for that guys manipulative ways so muchh a little too much if i may addwhy didnt the mc just say that the glasses guy has more coins than him like glasses guy literally has kyes pop off on em dokjadojka is a good character its the others who are bad and i see alot of people saying dojka is being bad and its cool yes hes not helping others whore not even trying he did help them earlier by giving them food for a cost money is a convenient tool for people and theyve just relied on it anyways like he said the first scenario was themed on original sin so it makes sense for everyone else to be sinfulsome people here really makes me wanna slap my phonevery interesting strokes nonexistent beardi think were entering the corruption arc i love the mc so much holy shtim glad he isnt sticking to the moral high ground because im sure that guy thats using incite would just use dokja until he was completely worn down its probably why the other protagonist left the subway immediately as well if he gives k coins today then hed have to give money again tomorrow and the next day because this group is just sitting arounddamn mc badass level skyrocketed from to a freaking but thats kinda cruel honestly i dont know what id do in this situation okay cause dokja was definitely justified in doing that all of these people have no problem turning on him if they had the opportunity so dont bring this moral crap on him nothing is free you need to work for these things so accept your fate or try to change and earn those damn coinsi really like the original sin dynamic herenow heres a character i can relate to honestly im sick of characters who always stick to the white side in a gray world theres no black and white really love dokjasht just went from to real quickdamn the kids power is strong never expected him to be able to connect to a monster that size early on i really like this development most mcs are just annoying talking about good and bad actually its all grey cant wait until dokja thrown a stone at zeus i will have to wait years to see thathyeonsong is the cutest baby big boy im glad hes not all self righteous and shitlets goo dokja supremacy dokja wont suck up to hypocrites this is the kind of mc i want cause in his world no one is fug releated to you they just leave you alone when you need them bihyeong being cute hahahaha you little wicked patootieyall i bet secret plotter is the guy who wrote the book he read im glad he isnt sticking to the moral high ground because im sure that guy thats using incite would just use dokja until he was completely worn down its probably why the other protagonist left the subway immediately as well if he gives k coins today then hed have to give money again tomorrow and the next day because this group is just sitting arounddamn mc badass level skyrocketed from to a freaking but thats kinda cruel

secret plotter is the guy who wrote the book he read yeah when im in an apocalyptic world i hope i find someone like him and end up in their party lmao why didnt he say that out loud you know that part where he said that they took someone elses life and cant take care of their own like thats factswho else hopes this will be adapted into an anime in the near futureim crying from pure fucking happiness i cant belive how good this is bringing back memories from when i read the novell t^tguys remember to like the chapterim laughing cause the regular main characters be like we need to uphold the moral standpoint and share while dokja just be like pay up btches~ i dont fcking care if you die only me and my friends can survive for almost free~ like oh my god~ xd he is like an anti hero or like one of those people you think are more logical than moralsome villains but are actually the main characteraka drstone you have been gifted coins aa hes so hoti am really really happy for dokja he turned it out amazingly i am waiting for the next episodefck yesdokja woke up and chose violence and i love itbro that sword is so coolthis is is just too good ive spent my night reading thisdont these people know it was their choice to buy food from him you cant get your money back with out giving the product back dummiesgoo dokja he doesnt owe them anything when they treated him so badly dokja kinda looking like a psycho at the end there and i kinda i like itthe secret is that the coins they use is the coins us readers use to buy fast passesdammnn dokja you rulei agree with dokjas logic why should someone that killed someone else to save themselves get coins from him for free what makes them so deserving of the coins also the food he had hed gathered for himself and was even willing to sell it to them they were not obligated to buy it nor was it his fault when it disappearedhonestly i would do the same in this situation being pushed around by the incite ability can only go as far as you let itdokja just killed a strong monsterwhat are these puny humans gonna do to him lol gtfohes simply just thinking about his own future theres nothing wrong with that people already do it in this world but are more corrupt about it damn manz tryna live dudei thought he would tell them that the glasses clown has coins but this might be better since even if all of these people manage to get past this round theyre guaranteed to die on the next round anyways lolfinally a character not scared of anything take their arms off kingwhy should you share you grabbing other people shit without asking to borrow it this guy is a smart dudeyou know what this is kim dokja the best mc ever and for novel readers did dokja acted like this in the novel i dont remember clearly but i think he was not that angry i really really want this to get turned into an animei got where hes coming from if he gives those ppl the coins thats equivalent to giving all the clothes off your back in the dead of winter and you die and they still in trouble it benefits for a sec but it didnt truly help i kind of like the route his character is taking a lawfully good character would have been supremely irritating because they would continuously sacrifice themselves without thinking of the personal repercussions just like an avg person hes neutral preservingoh my god im loving this so so much and its getting better every single episodemental note dont ask dokja for anything or i might lose my handshe risked his life to get those coins and what did yall do just sit around in the station expecting someone else to do the work for youdokja has hit his point i like this character so awesome i like itthese comments literally sound like constellation commentary lol but dokja really is an interesting character because he has a lot to deal with pleasing the constellations trying to stay alive while also helping others its really unfair because he has worked really hard for his coins while other people do nothing and just expect the coins to be handed to them gosh this whole comic is amazing king periodtwell that was hot nosebleeds you see nothingif dokja decide to side with that high moral to help those people he will defintely get trapped in cheon inho plan just like if you being kind to the people for one time they will ask you another kindness thats how human do even in the our world and inho want that for his own selfishness and so he can using and controling dokja thats why what dokja do here is right that last panel tho yaaass im so satisfied with his decision not everyone deserves your own kindness just gotta show em what u r truly capable of which enough to dread others and back offlegit wanna hear dokjas voice and the action asfkjfdl if this turn out to be an anime  theres no word can express my mind see this is why i couldnt survive in an apocalypse im too nice the lawful neutral best clift hanger everthis is definitely going to be an anime the way this story is progressing and the twist and turns theyve made so far and its only been chapters yes yes yes i love this scene what comes after is so great honestly so satisfyingbiyungs reactions on the indirect messages is so kawaii he is a antiheromy man went from midoriya to kirito real quick really thinking about buying the fast pass now this is hype afi think i would make the same decision considering the coinsi would ask and i would make decisionsya know what would be really awesome if dokja just killed the leader and took his coins im really liking this series thanks for your hard workdokja has impressed me by showing how smart and calm he iswhat those fools should of known is that everyone has a breaking point and his just got destroyedim glad that dokja isnt gonna put up with this pricks bull anymore it makes me happy to see hes not in a gaming moodremembers how people usually ask for scope the day before an exam and the aducity to ask for stationery the hour before exam me why should ibest character everthe apocalypse blame gamefinally the snowball plushy mini demon is back not that other bratthe constellation is very impressed with your performance she decides to gift you she also says thank you for replinishing her sanitydokjas squad shouldnt return back to the camp they can just survive on their owndaaanggg someone cover the kids ears this is about it get even uglierafter reading the webnovel i cant begin to tell you how happy i am with this seeing it in picture is one thing now we just need a studio to bring it to lifedokja be likei dont give a fucki love how he doesnt care if i were him id do the same cause why should you care when these ppl are all selfish bustardsdamn how i hate these people in storys who only blame others like that wont help or solve the problem mc has no friggin bussines giving them free coins and then die himself like bruhi did think he would pull out his sword but i did not expect him to cut off the dudes hands jsjsjjsjsjsi feel like the mc is going to become more of an anti hero you know kinda like deadpool but a little more sanedoes anyone know how their names are pronounced especially gilyeongme being a huge fan of rpgs im really interested to see how our little group of characters changes not only emotionally but their skills and items tooi % agree with my mans over here billion iqhmm id say hes a lawful neutral still does good things and follows the law but like hes really only in it for himself and maybe a few others if he cares about them enough although thats probably not that likelyok but dokja that was kinda hot ngl what about the business man he got like million or thousand coins from the curse thing didnt hei love dokja even morebadassi was so interested in this webtoon that after reading the last episode i went ahead and read the webnovel lolwhy the hell he needs to share this is apocalypse he gained his coins slaughtering demons he doesnt need to share it with some man only sitting in the corner safely i would do the same with one exception i would spare kids pov you dont remember the actual main characters name they may think he was acting villain but no hes just being logical and i like itdont worry bro you can open your character status in like chapters im so glad dokja didnt do what other people would deem the right thing those people are hypocrites especially that whatshisface he should die firsthuh come on even the lil kid is using his survival skills its high time these people understand dokja way to go boy man i really dislike inho cheon i think dokja is doing the right thing well see exactly what he plans next chapter he didnt take those coins from anyone they willingly paid because they wanted the food he originally collected himself and he brings up a good point that all these people who are alive now most likely killed someone in the first scenario to survive i cant wait to see how the characters develop especially huiwon also cant wait to see what fate belongs to inhowho would give out coins to help killers survive like who the hell they think they area lot of top comments are saying everyone there had to kill in the first scenario but like there are clearly young children & older people present maybe they got lucky and had a different scenario bc i dont remember dokja or dokkaebbi saying the first quest was the same for all users but also even if it was the same maybe some of them had similar solutions to dokja in that scenario and the comments are saying its pragmatic to let all those people die i disagree thats eugenics i need coins too  to read any furtherlolall this time i thought the dokaebbi eyes were just hollow sockets when in reality hes got these cutesy bubble eyes damn he really said bye bye to that guys arms i like how different dojka thinks im quite interested to see what he does next i cant deny it that guy was good at manipulating people at the right time he knows when to use his powerful enchanting words that was a nice battoujutsu i like this episodeomg i think i have a crushdokja hello my name is dokja and im chaotic neutral nice to meet youdokja thats dark i like it hehehethe color of his words are as ice cold as he is ryt now lolread the web novel guys it is srsly amazing and you will not regret it i couldnt wait for more of the webtoon so i started the novel and i have been reading it non stop for the past three days coz its so good i keep trying to recommend it but it feels just like when dokja tried to recommend twsa and no one listened to him yk this is a very interesting turn of events aand now we have a psychopath as the thumbnail for a week being kind is good but being a pushover isnt all those ppl would die anyway because they are bad players so dojka would only kill himself for nothing he made the correct decision when the world gets bad enough the good go crazy but the smart they go bad he just stated clearly no to socialism just dokja being dokja at this moment they should know they fcked upthey do realize they are trying to say they deserve coins and then attempt to murder their only chance at survival plus they dont even know killing him will give them back their coinsi need coins too yasss dokja slayss that villain is dangerous and cunning he turns everything against you including your actions and wordsgenius kill someone then take your coins back by having to touch fingers where the person transferring coins has to think absolutely brillianti would rather be a villain who does good sometimes than be a heroyass i had to same he very logical character and puts himself first mf went sicko mode im not even halfway through this webtoon but i just know this is going to be one of my favouritesif u want your coins back give the food back or did u eat it alreadyconstellation broke reader is satisfied with the amount of head rubs dokja is giving gilyeongcrissy wake up i dont like this right decision dude dokja is not your typical saviour protagonist lolall i could say is slaydokja i love you very much dasurrrvv ahabshsjjdhssudokjas character he kind of look like sung jin wooim liking dokja hes being smart and realistic in this situation yess i like the kind but logical mc hes kind but hes a human he must be kind to himself and the people he care first before random people who just want to leech hes right he risked his life for those coins and he better not give them to people who just sat there and complained as said before age or gender doesnt matter here u can just upgrade ur stats instead of complaining abt not wanting to diedokja is karma incarnate you reap what you sowthat was a wise decision dokja i am very sick because of the development of the dokja character  it making the situation more interesting day by day hes being realistic i mean these people are murderers and cant even pay for the sin the committed dokja went out of his way and earned these coins so why should he give them he would just make lose and what would these people give him backin return nothing hes not all goodie its an apocalypse a fucking apocalypse crazy people  he wants to survive everyone wants to survive you should be held responsible for you own live they are all moral incorrect inc dokja protag who doesnt care about moral high ground woof woof woof others give me back my coins dokja suck my ass the absolute irony of making the beginning villain a literal edgelord just to pull the same garbage with your main charactereven if he did give them coins they would be monkeys and stay in the station and die the next day anyway _ bruhanyone sharing is caring dokja i dont get paid enough to carethats right show them what kind of people would be like in the future aggressiveness and despirationthese people have the audacity to think that they can kill someone and then beg for their lives like btw has anyone realised that there is another little kid there with his mum r u telling me he killed somebody too dangi would of done the same and i would say that if you arent going to risk it for the biscuit then you are unreliablei love how the kid is just holding his skull weapon so calmly while watching a mans arma get cut offwait i just realized that people would have automatically completed the first round as the body regenerates cells and others die off constantly and a cell is a living organisim rightif these people want to survive so much then they should probably go and do something instead of expecting to leech off of people who go out and earn their survival like dokja doesyes lets go dokjaa i really love his character its a breath of fresh air im so happy dokya isnt the stereotypical goodtwoshoes im so tired of seeing main characters doing things out of guilt and morals especially if theyre not obligated toi mean you want coins but do nothing to help its a tought world you live in you gotta earn the right to livedeath note vibes right nowi love dokja glad hes not a dumb mc actually love his villain side loldokja joey doesnt share food hes a villain a smart one that protects his comradessoo coolllbut not rlly i woulda done smth to return fire on that other evil guyoh and welcome back bihyeong fluffineeesshiit that was so sexy damnthis unlike him~ but this is going to be exciting dokja youre so coolbihyeong~ i miss you ~~yes dokja slice themlove this dont give in to the majority complainers who did this to themselveschaddokja slayyoh you want your coins back revive every single person you killed in the first scenario and give me back every bit of perfect food i sold to you ^^i dont think hes decision is not really evil if think of it those people are the one who blame him from the start so in short those type of people are just face they only agree with you if they get alot of benefits from it without doing something think about it he work so hard to reach that point while those people are just chilling there waiting for miracle to happen doing nothing and blame other for their own misery oh my goddd i got goosebumps dokja my king hello he is so cool im freakin so enjoying this twist of personality ughhh i hate constantly seeing unrealistically good morales people bruh in this kinda situation u gotta do everything to survive its a two way street if ur gonna help someone hes so coolok not gonna loe they coulda put a finer face on that last panneldokja casually showing off his absolute dumptruck as he slices that mans arm offwhy does the last slides remind me of ninang bryan from tiktokwait i just want to make sure that her god person thingy is theseus or theaus i forgot but i remember playing a game and it was labrynthy and it said something about the string the thsues guy used to navigate the doungeoun but im pretty sure were thinking  rightactually i agree with him i would probably be the villain so to say if i was to a survival world like this also hes not completly selfish he did share things with his companions and gave them a very good discount too all in all hes just trying to survive and the people in there all have killed someone to survive while he hasnt so in the end the way he does things to me is pretty justifiedomfg finally a character who doesnt have hero saving syndrome hero saving syndrome is something i created it basically means the mc tries to save everyone even when its clearly dangerousyes use the  i wanna see what it does if i had to guess dokjas moral alignment if guess that hes either chaotic neutral or neutral evilfinally but i do hope atleast the children can be savedomg dokjas new sword why is bihyeong so cute i want to hug him so badif i was in dokjas position i would have given them help immediately but probably would regret it later on because people are fickle minded they can demand for your help and forget what you did for them and turn on you later on he became that nerd into badass real quickhe actually did the right thing its good he said no coins arent cheap they should of worked hard to earn some they had all day lazy people wanting handoutshes just like meevery bitch in this platform other then dokja group survived by killing someone and now they are begging for there lifeohh schnapp goatjany goati love himthats what i would have done if i was himbro this guy so badass its hot no homoifw dokja being such a dynamic mcdokja omg ily hes so fineget disarmed squatsman this is awesome i love a good antiherojesus loves you finally yes my insides are melting this is a top tier protagonist right here not like some cliche saint wannabe masochistic protagonist like in every other web novelmangahes so handsome constellation dark flame phoenix smiles at dokjas sudden change in personality and cruel wayshe made a good move literally half of the people there were bad people anyways they deserved itthe way dojka cut the persons arm was the coolest thing ever i have seen all weekshit escalated realquickhell yeahhh texting with the host snapping this is amazingdespite most people thinking that secretive plotter is the author im gonna guess its dokja himself or at least a different version of him my reasoning the fact that the secretive plotter recommended a scenario and that dokja has said that he has recommended twsa to others is the reasoning weak yes but its there and weak enough for it to be a well crafted twist in my opinionim absolutely in love with this story shame on me for not finding this earlieri dont care how cruel i might sound right now but just kill them all already i cant stand this anymorei really cant hate bihyung if hes this cutemoral high ground umm excuse me but this is the apocalypse yes tell them dokja honestly id be so fed up i wouldve snapped a lot earlier than dokja didas he should beat they asses dokja this is why everyone likes dokjaalthough tonka is acting a little evil he probably is trying to do this to somehow reason to the people and break hans incite skill and probably earn a incite skill himself furthermore he might himself ask the people to collectively kill hans and his henchmen which will make the people earn the required coins go kinghyeonsyeong is a big man child and im here for itagain hes so hotdokja is a really interesting character ambiguous gray characters are my favorite if portrayed correctly its their fault too hahai love dokja hes not one of those good guys but hes more interesting love an unhinged character more of him plsi love how dokja is keeping a balance between the ryt sense of morality and the manipulative aspects of the situation while on one end he is keeping his promise to get food and is doing as much as he can to keep the ones in charge from doing anything bad he isnt tolerating any kind of manipulation and taking his stand we stan yaasssjhdhhdhhdhdhdshshvnndndndnhf so satisfying im curious in the raw is gilyeong call dokja only by his name or he call dokja by hyung dokjaa my duudeegod damn dokja is cold blooded  beat their as i love his character so much more nowconstellations smiledok smiles evilyme both but with laughterdokja do be having a cute butt doeand if i refuse on a tshirtchillshyeonseong cutiei like that it seems like dokja is becoming more like yu the longer the story goes ondream be like sharing is caring and i dont caredokja is maintaining the high moral ground as he said the first scenario was the original sin they all murdered someone to survive but have since been living on handouts failing to take responsibilities for their own lives after taking someone elses in his eyes they arent good people and have proven time and time again to be scummy or pathetic on top of being murders besides coins doesnt seem that hard to make with these mood constellations  hell yes you dont owe these people anything they have the gull to take a life but not the balls to survive by their own accord i think he should just drop it all on han and let him use those coins he just goti love that dokja isnt the golden child and is morally gray like so happy for it its so much more realistic i really like this dude he is giving me serious life lessons atmyou need to make an anime out of this i havent got this worked up over a story in a whilepfft at least dokji and i have the same though its their fault for being so dependable they should also hunt their own foodsif i were him ill be like i need to take care of myself for today tomorrow and so on called me selfish if you want but its survival instinct why did i smile when dokja slice that man armslayy them alll hun esp tht bastard incho whtever tht iswelp time to kill them allhe do be kinda scarycutie bihyeong is backkthe constellation of me is satisfied with your doingmy guess is hell help ppl who help him and leave ppl behind who wrong him but who knows idfk im getting major bi himbo vibes from hyunsung since the beginning yeah glad he finally snappedoh man i missed bihyeong like hes so adorable i really appreciate the constellations comments lolso no ones gonna talk about how the giant insect beat the stone rhino in a fightok lets be reali mean why would he give the coins he earnedeven if he give how long they are gonna survive day day and to how many of them he can givethe only thing they will try to do is suck him until his coins get finished ofc becoz he looks easy among ones with high coinsinho or they may even kill himand then go to another thats how it workswhat a badasswonder what the constellations thought of that stop using your money on coins ii didi just think its funny and creative how they incorporated the constellations reaction to different situationsi dont know how the angel will react thoughhe attac backthe constellation the sleepy chaos is too lazy to interactcheon inho keeps getting on my nervesbro they didnt risk their lives to stay alive why should he share with lazy cowardsi know this guy is tired i feel bad for all of them i mean probably all those people killed or let someone died in order to survive yes the good thing to do would be to share but why should he really i do think that moral is an important thing and kindness is a great value to have but you cant force other people to be kind nor righteous specially in a world like that and especially when theyll most surely turn their backs on him once he stop been useful i dont like many of his decisions but i understand themis it just me or is bihyeong looking more like the demonic child of monokuma and pikachuto be honest people probably thought there wouldnt be a survival fee so they mightve bought food with the rest of those coins so in a way he is kind of responsible for their deathyeah bihyoeong is back i thought they removed him bachade he made the contract but i guess not nice though hed be really cute if he wasnt such a sadistah a fellow antihero i see i really wanna find out who is the secretive plot constellation ook like um naofumi was like this the stupid princess lied got him in trouble and he became a good bad guy just like dokjakinda wish we could see his total coin count would k really break the banknoo dont lose your mindhah plopbeautifuloooh that hurt woah dokja hejehehwbnehd so coolfood horder is pleased by dokjas actionsi mean hes not wrong but hes also not rightitd be funny if he sold out mr suit for his k coinsi jus noticed this but the art style is similar to unholy bloodthe entitlement really jumped outhyeonseong lee looks a bit like our voltron space dadabsolutely no onedokja the concept of what we know as what is good and what is bad left this world when this game started damn perfect response reminds me of those beggers in assassins creedthe way i smack my leg from that scene can be heard all the way to the next villagefr you wanted to live you cant take care of your selfthat old man is uselessinteresting  i really want this to be a book so i can keep with me and i can recommend to others oh get over yourselffinally a realistic character me why would i give my coins to you too i just find it funny that the sound effect for dokja cutting of that mans hand is plopi dont know why but i like the main character always teaching the person in wrong a lessonoop if he lost his finger did he loose his money xdoh hes somewhat of an evil character evil in the way that he causes grief to those who care about himdokja i love youyay bihyeong is backi love how dokjas a morally grey character i completely agree with everything he did it makes sense cuz hes not obligated to anyone and he is kinda helpful to some people so yeahomniscient reader huge chicken legsits finger lickin goodi mean dokjas right theyre the ones who survived because they killed people and now they blame dokja for them not being able to survive because of the lack of coins so pathetic and what a hypocritedude was like no thanks hes backdamn dokja yes kinggg have i ever said how much i do love dokja  ahh and the story is barley beginning gosh damn someone pass me some chicken wings this is getting goodwould dokja count as a morally grey character oh finally this is what ive been looking for to an mcwell it is true if you can not survive on your own in that kind of world why would you still wanna live shart getting realomg smilethose ppl deserve this they already commited sin in the first scenerio and now they r blaming dokja for this situation heck yea dokja made the ryt decisionwhy is everything going so smoothly people give the coins dokja why people kill that bastd dokja big mistake slash people sht readers yessthat was unexpected i thought dokja would defer the crowd to that han guy who has coinsi wonder where this will gohyeonseong lee has begun too simp on you if he has the most coins that means he has the most fighting experience some people should know that instead they should bargain with himthere are people like them everywhere manipulated by others and just live following the flow they dont have any passion to pursue and go with the majority even i am like that sometimes this just gave me a smack on my head watch out junghyeok yu theres a new protagonist in townyaaasss dokja yaasswow dokja is really cool but why didnt he throw that guy who killed him under the buson that last panel dojka got hahaha i like this f@ckng reader this type of character is what i want to see may the f@ckng creator make more characters like this hahaha f@ck you guys btwas marcus always says no refundsthis is true shit bro why you gotta be helpful and all that stuff selfishness is human nature but they bought the food with their coins earlier then they want a refund smham i sensing light yagami vibes right nowgive his food back if they want their coins i like dokjas neutral personlityeeeki felt bad for them up until he pointed out that they had to kill someone to get this far ok ok okaay be a bad bitch fine by mewhy do i remember shen qingqiu with the blue thingy heck yeshyeonseong lee is adorable with the way his eyes are sparkling theyre blaming dokja that they dont hav enough coins when it was their choice to usegiv them to himi think im in love dokja has join the dark sidehuiwon be ready to killits demon time damn dokja i got chillsthis is great for a moment there i thought i was reading solo leveling this webtoon is so good it reminds so much of solo leveling and i like how they dint copy solo leveling and made it their own thing every week i have to wait for a new chapter for solo leveling but now to wait i can read this this is probably my second favorite webtoon behind solo leveling i love this bookdokjas development is impressive his judgment based on logic and reasoning and him not letting anyone wear him down or manipulate himits a leader quality  his eyes went from innocent at the start of the series to downright badass nownow he pulled it out and slammed it on the tabledokja is a true capitalistholy fricking moly i love this webtoon who else read the web novel im up to ch now  btw im bragging %did sangah notice what dokja was doing when he was trying to see her personal attribute im afraid of what will happen to his group now so far they have all trusted him because he has helped them out to some degree but after he cut off that guys arms and isnt helping anyone then maybe they will go against him too if they did how would that change things and how come he didnt out the other guy didnt he get a bunch of coins after taking the last blow of the monster dokja beatremember the name roecleanconstellation galiate is speechlessi want some of his wits also his ability to read the room and say no impresses me to an extreme levelthis manga is exactly my type sad thing is i cant buy coins cuz im broke cliffhangers are illegaldepending on others is not a bad thing but if they tell you to depend on them otherwise that would be cruel to them shits going down mananyone else thought dokja is doing hood rnthe constellation fangirl shipper is pleased with this developmentpeople giving all they got just to live another day hes a reader its understandablethe moment dokja drew his sword i heard megalovania begin to playdude that last scene was sooo bad asome people bout to get torn upi feel like hes a little too prepared for this world that right now hes not fully accepting what around him is real hes just doing what hed dream of doing for years while reading the story i think theres going to be a moment where he really reflects on his actions and maybe breaks down ngl sangah gave away her attribute and sponsor with this but since its major spoilers ill refrain from saying anything wait bihyung was the one responsible for the item box jeez im on chapter and thats still new info aww theyre all so happy and now theyre not i gotta say inho was clever but dokja was just two steps ahead heythe cursed guy got k coinsso once they realize that hell be chased by the others xdlol dokjas not just gonna give these people welfare they dont deserve itwhat about the deamon killer with k coins wheres he at throw that btch under the buslook at the flick of that wristhe looks so psychotic in that last panel i love this character so fking muchyeah if it were me id be a clear looks like you fellas are gonna die today siigh i wish i werent broke then i could read the next seven episodesim so proud a main character with some gutsdokja i love you i deada died when he said that i wonder how will be the character development of dokja hmm me when my sister tries to take my food her gimme summ me why should i what really shocks me about this story is how no one out of the main group has said anything about their family members its so sad to be taken away from everyone you love so fast gosh thats why i really really like this webtoon wooh plot twistimmaculatemans grew moon ballsthat guy i dont have enough coins to give coins to all this poor peopleme if i was dokja bitch do i look as if i caredidnt whats his face sell them food toome reading all the episodes times wiating for the next oneplop plop the dudes arm got chopped choppedi love dokjas character hes not going to be the main character that always wants to do the right thing even when it could cost him his life hes more logical and i think thats gonna make the story a lot more interestingthe next week well see a lot of blood and i cant waitthing is he still kinda is maintaining the moral high ground who knows what these people did in the initial scenario on top of many already having shown to be straight up bad guys particularly those led by the gang leader dude so not only is it not a stretch to assume these people arent as innocent as they seem but its also very likely that they werent lucky and killed some bugs like dokjas group did which considering what dokjas thoughts have been this is exactly what hes thinkingthe man snapped lmaogod dayum double cheeked up dokja showing them whats upbesides that guys hands hes so hotjust walk to him poke poke poke with that iron thingy and coins rewarded from the neet godthat was one hell of a turnthe way my voice cracked when i screamed hell yedokja made it clear that hes not messing around why would anyone take him as a push overoh theres gonna be one for female character and she go be a badass this is so good i loving this so farcant wait to see what happens nextits the apocalypse bishes something had to snap eventually he was petering on the edge of this from day onei have to wait days for the free episodenooo i neeed moreit would be cool if dokja ends up being the antagonist and the protagonist remains the same he did say the regressor lost his humanity after regressing times maybe dokja will lose his over time given how strong he is itll be interesting to see how characters like sangah can beat his fourth wall ability especially since he has no character profile on her it is possible to beat dokja since gilyeong already has an idea of what dokja is capable ofif im remembering this correctly isnt the cost of a human life coins so if he killed half of them probably the ones trying to kill him then he could save the other halfi feel like dokjas alignment would be neutral because he seems to fit into a morrelly grey area seeing as he isnt evil but then he also isnt good either its really cool to see characters such as dokja who dont stick to morals but still arnt evil im in love with this webtoonhe got you the food twice you expect him to help you when you didn do shidemon like judge of fire best constellationdokja done did snapped and grew some ballsim so proud of himgod i love this also i think the little dokibies are cute i like the white one moarkill that inho guythis is so good i loving this so farcant wait to see what happens nextits

someones falling in lovedojaka has started getting serious this is where the real dojaka shows his real self and he is gonna be godlydo this in a baby voice for x experience you prick give us back our coins i want a refund if it were me yelling at dokja and he said why should i give you any with that glare i would have left immediatelywell i mean since he read the comic he kinda is prob the reason why this is happening so yeahonly the smart strong and clever ones survive in this scenario you need to do whats best for you in this case become a villainsome people will resent him but thats just what he needs to docan i jus say im loving this because im having a great time seeing dokja breaking all this mf bada good guy i took that line from cinemawins he is a good youtuber subscribeliterally their fault they dont have coins like boi when will you learn that your actions have consequencesbadass mode activatingoh shit hes scary in a hot wayvaya la serie perdi muchos fanticos en cuestin de unos cuantos episodios pero si esta bien chidalogic but such a cold boidamn this webtoon is really giving me anxiety like this could happen any moment dokja iswoo his face in the past panel is so c o o lat the end i started screaming beat there asses dokja best these asses  i wish they put in the line about the black history from bihyung that one always stuck out to mei just read the whole novel in weeks nice to read the webtoon nowrandom guy im going to take all your coinsdokja not todaymess with the dokja you get the glockjadaamnn lets do thisneed coins earn it this shit is getting intence and i love itoh my god i dont think i can wait for the next partperisheveryone sharing is caringdokja man fck sharingif only the democratic party could stand up to the republicans that stronglydokja is true neutral maybe even evil neutral definitely not any gooddokja is a dope mc tlike bish if you wanted to survive should have gotten the other scenerioi freaking love this form the looks of it dokjas alignments is going to be neutral goodthis is survival game who just who will share their advantage to others yes dokja slay kinglmao i wouldve asked them for a scholarship essay  earn your share bishhthat scene right there reminded me of light and lyesssfinally the killer instinctactually i dont know if i would have been capable to refuse helping others but i love how he responded to them i am totally in love with this comic and i wanted to ask if you have a book in the making or possibly making this into a anime series i will buy all of them as soon as they come out this is the best comic ive read in so long and you literally have me hanging on a thread cant wait to read some more your loyal readerdokja is not one to stick to being the gold coin of the people and that is great because it is proof that u owe nothing to no one and u are not entitled to them and honestly i wouldnt share coins either if i were in the place of dokja cuz he worked hard and killed beasts to earn those coins and they think just by threatening him they will get coins hell naw get off ur asses and go do something useful for once lmaoodayum the art looks so much like solo leveling im sooo excited yheeits so good to see something different fuck heroism life is hard and heartlessgive me some coins i wanna read what happens next otlhaha dokja is pissedlets goooaahhh i love this mc hes not like thos mc who will always choose to do the good things this is getting to be more interesting and i love itoh damn dont get any closer or you gonna look like a trex with short armsholy shii nuggeysgangstaoh my gosh yes ive been searching for a story like this great route to take with this development i miss this savage dokjayou have activated bad ass modei love dokja i would have killed them all as soon as they started asking for my fooddokjas reaction serves them all right  they killed someone in the first scenario and now they want dokja to give the coins for which he sacrificed many thingsohh i love his crazy eyes still those poor peopleugh that was so sexy of dokjathe constellation asks for five coinsdokja im your proud and loud simp did he really think dokja would just let them kill himnooo i want to read moree sobsyess slice themaye rambo kill them all an donedokja is so cooli wouldve said that cursed jerk off has thousands of coins he is pissedomg i missed bihyeong soo much ^^  glad that hes back yall being like the moral high ground um bro its even the moral high ground to give them coins i wouldnt say that decision is morally not good at all obviously its isnt the bad thing but like jdjeh yeits true it does look pathetic to blame dokja like its their fault for not go hunting for the mf coins dokja is such a cool character i love characters like himglad the survival fee only exists in the story otherwise id be dead right now  i have zero coins on webtoon & its right nowfuckemim here just hoping that gilyeong and others in the group wont get scared or distrustful of dokja because of this or telling him that he should help them those people dont deserve it and dokja is % right with taking that approach even if he helped them theyd never pay backi really love this webtoon so freaking satisfying omg im in loveunlike other male leads his plots are different and alot more intresting neither op nor weakwell a man tries to murder you to survive at the orders of a coward so you make an example out of him perfectly reasonable in the apocalypseyes that badass moment im waiting for he trynna survive the apocalypse okayno time for begging noobs just get good smhsuper coolfreak school ami right fellasyess yess take my moneyyou dont always have to be kindariadnes thread sjsndbdis he going to go full lelouchwow i dont agree how he handled the situations but then again when the other guy is like that the rest wont listen to what he wants to say but this is so amazing tt_tto kawaii kotodokja is not like that she saidgirl dont do it dokjadokja be like oh please just shut updokja adios amigostook dudes arms ok that was hot well its true that everyone there had to kill someone or something to even get that far and they have nothing to offer him still i hope he doesnt go full edgelordi like how dokja chose a nonethical way the next chapters are going to be immaculateo holy mother of god this made him x hotter thats my baby loving how closely this follows the novel glad to be able to see the characters ive only read about drawn out and coming to life this toon makes my wednesdays betterwe love seeing morally grey characters man give me someone i can really relate too wait didnt the other guy who got cursed have the most coins everyones gangsta until dokja shows upnext week needs to be here tmmrits the apocalypse at a certain point its everyone for themselves just a reminder to all the people who want him to share because its the right thing to do all of these people begging for coins are murderers and its not like hes obligated to help them either just because he is the main charactermy man dojka is going for that chaotic neutralevil routesavage dokja i admit it i am bored of all good and soft main leads i want something worth and here comes dokja the savage king actually in real life everyone is selfishblood for the blood godeveryones coming up with big brain comments and im here like lol dokjas hoti love this sword it makes me feel like im welding a idk justsomething good ya knowdaamn that was sickkill them alli hadnt thought of the first scenario like that they all killed someone else to be here and thus nullifies any reason to even attempt for a moral high ground most of dokjas group killed insects and remains for the time being non murderers very interestingits easy to say this cause its a fictional story but not everyone was gonna survive anyway why not just get rid of the pricks and assholes like thisthe decision he take might be seem wrong but tbh if i was at his place i would do the same thing i guessyeah cut their asses thats mah boyi would have had them compete for the coins like top five get a loan for the survival fee and maybe ill let them join me or fight for me later to pay it back their debt pahahahahaha i love psycho dokja hahahahahais there no one mention about how gilyoungee calling dokja in the novel he call dokja hyung since he is younger than dokja maybe its better to change how gilyoungee call dokja in the next episodethey fucked up they fxcked up they fxcked up my mans went off not like they can cancel himi like the scans translation of the last scene more it was more epic and cool which got me excited for the next chapters this mess youre all in do you really think its my fault goosebumps all over my body after that linefinally im sick of these people who just wait for help and do nothing that inho cheon too his character is disgusting people like him never admit their mistakes and push the blame onto others all the time while making it seem that theyre a saint despicable i agree with dokja those people are being pretty selfish even though they want to survive they cant be aggressive and start asking for a refund of what they already ate sotoo late people ooh its starting to get interesting teehee aye yoi screamed out loud when he cut his arms off hes serious imagine you attack someone and they whip out a sword and chops your hands off ah a normal dayyes suddenly the apocalypse is turning into a double apocalypse he cant give all these people coins everyday just to survive dokja has no real obligation to these people they never saved his life he only profited off of them and the only people he really has ties to is the people in his party so i stand by his decisionbihyeong is backoofhe does have a point everyone there is likely a murder and the people who tell him to be a good person are the worst ones well they are the one who demand food and now they are putting the blame on dokjawow such a pathetic humansi want to see the thug leadee diei want to see the thug leadee diehe gonna kill that blonde and when he does ill be laughingwell he did nothing wrong everyone who managed to make it here killed somebody but did not have the guts to carryon and earn their living so no one has any obligation to meet their demands if he lets them survive now by giving in they will only die next round because they are incapable of surviving on their own thats a wasted investment okay that went from to real quicki highly doubt dokja is gonna let the random kids die if he does then the support of his allies goes down the gutter and most the constellations gonna hate himi love this series the constellation dania twilight is laughing her teeth off due to the evil face of the incarnation dokja kim the constellation dania twilight is too broke to gift you coins coins please i just need coins to buy the next episodeugh i love main characters like this bc the plot is so interestingdokja i getchu bud thats the exact reason why i dont like to play a hero every person will ask u about ur morals i have read this novel til the end just incase you know survival of the fittest bitchesdokja looks more handsome when hes being mean are interested to see your moves to me dokja seems like a good guy but instead of giving handouts hes teaching others to be responsible for their actions and in his own ways helps his friends enjoy this type of kim dokja while you still can this man is going to throw handsboi this world is twisted now and days so survival is the way to go not that i percent agree with dokja but still i love the twistsy e swhere did those huge drumsticks go we get dokja is a badass and the other people are idiots but is no one going to talk about hyeonseong lee and his sheild its so sparklyhehe im excited to see everything illustrated i recently picked up the novel and am on chapter things haven gotten extremely interesting i recommend giving the novel a try if you ever have spare time ^^badassthis is funholy shitscary but real fing cooldamm hes neutral i dont know why people mad he cant look after others with no disregard to his own life in my opinion people should never be blamed for doing what they need to do to survivei love dokjas character aint like some typical protagonist with golden heartthis is a prime example of a good protagonistyeah bitches stop free loadingtheres a lady with a little boy i hope he does share some coins with them though vg is fascinated by your story and is waiting for new episodes he have no coins vis it me or dokjas really hot with that swordjust like the people in this current chapter i need coinslove it novel plot is really good and now the drawings i dont deserve this one bitcharacters like dokja are my favorite everyone its his faultdokja lemme tell you somethinlemme tell you somethinremeber communism works in theory but when put into practice it fails horribly everyone at the shelter should know thatuno reversed that green shirts threatooh~ dokja is so tenseyes boy ask for some respect if i may her skill reminds me of hisokas bungee gumunbroken faith in action looks absolutely stunninghe is taking a very interesting route had it been me i would have also refused to disclose little to any information as well fearing that it would cost my life however im kind of concerned to his development as an individual because in the beginning he was shy and seemed nice enough now he has become nearly similar to the regressor and its quite hard to hd anything against him when any other person in his shoes wouldve done the same bihyeong i missed yougreat chapter dokjas character is super interesting im very excited to see how this scenario endsbut im just a kidif i was grown and had lots of mobey i would turn this into animedokja is soo cooli rate it lowkey the big ego dudes fault cause he built a community that became like thati know that the crowd of people are heavy hypocrites but i really cant blame them theyre just trying to survive by buying food and asking for help from people who can help them its just a survival instinct and also imagine if you were in that situation you dont have powerful friends maybe youre not very good you dont have a good constellation and youre broke most importantly youre not the main characterprotagonist in the story at all so you have to live its just pitifuli love it this character us going closer to the chaotic neutral side but sticks firmly in true neutral this way in terms of dnd allinment checks he could instantly alter his actions to output a spicific looking outcome like he looks true chaotic evil then maybe if your pushing it episodes later he is neutralhe need to get to the alignment slowly and slowly he looks like the ideal lawful good protagonist instead he is a neutral character who is on for the ridecant wait for kim dokja whipping those bastard assesomg getting these updates is always one of the highlights of my studyfilled week im really interested to see how dokja turns out i love the direction its going in right nowyeess we love a morally grey characterjudgment time kim dokja is awesome xdonline schoolhome work can wait the childs life is more important must proteccgod i love it when character dont take any sht  dokja is an ultimate savage loli just wanna binge thislook at those happy blushing face lee hyunseong is such a dorklets go dokja whooprotecc bby gilyeong my bby leemans speakin the teuth they all killed on the first round and everything they did up til then was their choice so they cant really blame amyone but themselvesdokja has a point here while he obviously wants to help he doesnt owe these people anything if they failed the test they failed the test he doesnt have to sacrifice his life for the sake of somebody elsepeople erase my foolish decisions and give me coins again so i dont suffer my own consequences dokja no cant he just finish the scenario and save everyone from payingdokja is added to the list of dark haired mcs i simp for thank you creator for my birthday giftim i the only one that finds the cotton ball thing cuteoh his arm got cut off huhdokja you lit he didnt have does kinds of morals he just didnt want to stand out but was forced to do so by a jackass with the power to manipulate the masses id kill someone for more coins to read ahead in this webtoon i really want this to be turned into an anime it would be so good viva la revolutionbut it kinda made sense all those people survived because they killed someone and now that they cant even manage to survive on their ownyou prick that t man is soo pathetic i cant stand ityou know what i like about dokja hes not like your usual mc who wants to save everyone who doesnt want anyone to die who wants to be the hero hes not really sympathetic and he sees things as they are eg these people were shit to me before so why should i help them do they deserve my help he wants to do whats best for him just like they all do except that hes not leaching off of others hes doing it himself i really respect him as a character for thatsome of you will die but that is a sacrifice im willing to make he looked like a badass at the end just like a villain and i absolutely love iti am so hyped for next episoderealistically speaking most of these people are going to die anyway maybe not today or even tomorrow but they wont last with the monsters as a whole most people are weak they look for easy ways out and for others to do for them giving the money back or paying their way for more day only prolongs the inevitable and leaves you with even more people begging tomorrow this decision had to be made sooner or later this series is so amazing im so excited every tuesday after a hard day at work to read thiscounter offer nodokja you bastard that was too badassu go dokja i missed you dokkaebi if that was the spelling loldang dokja is ice coldinsert evil giggle if words dont work they bout to talk to these handswhat a badass protagonistwill i get killed if i say yesquestion for people who read the manhwa gilyounges stance in the last panel shows he is ready to throw hands for his new father figurehell yeah no stupid goodytwoshoes here babyhe could of shifted it to the rich annoying guy i dint remember the name of whi kill stealed to get k coinsdokja did the right thing you cant blame some one for everything game is game i get excited when he cut off that mrons hand cant wait  decision]he looks so badassomg slayythat one guy who has over coins be like $$$see this is what im saying omniscience has a cost and that cost is that every interaction you have down to the smallest level is an equation you just need to solve for the best possible outcome and it doesnt matter what that takes or gains because its deffinitionally best its basically blue orange moralitytbh i dont like the heartlessness but at the same time i know damn well id do the same thing honestly its hard to judge this situation bc he doesnt know if everyone there actually killed someonesome couldve had the same idea with the bugs but at the same time its most likely they didi love his character right nowhyeonseong omgthe leader of the major group is so manipulative i dont think any of the about to die characters tried it but if they had some coins left just not enough for the survival fee i might have been tempted to negociate with dokja to an exchange in order to die with a full belly like the last smoke but instead a last steaki know they probably have to do that but i laugh every time i see the notice of depictions of violence like you should have written that into the manga description its in almost every chaptergod damnblushin like a maniac rn what kind of dummy rushes someone with a sword personally who even cares bout these people theyre bloodthirsty as soon as things turn sour and they cant see that the obviously evil leader is in the wrong here edit and if you want to survive in an apocalypse situation like this you have to figure out a way to survive being a mindless background groupthinker is a surefire way to die ingenuity is the way to goha people with no moral tryna be moral loli really like how dokja doesnt try to compromise with everything in his way pretty refreshing tbhi think this would happen when something like this happen those people should start taking responsibility for their own after killing people from st round damnn that was so damn good so satisfying yes dokja slay slay those bitchesyes good choice dokjaslay dokjai really like the constellations they seem extremely cool especially the prisonerim happy he did that hyeonseongs reaction to the shield is pricelessahhh this feels so much better im tired of those characters who try to stay at societys standards you go dokjayay morally grey characters are my favoriteyeah kindai love that he is not niceamazing story and art please support the authortranslatori agree with dokja theyre in a position where they have it make an effort to survive and its the law of the chain strong and weak ones and he doesnt have to share his coins that he collect with his and team effort also you share once and theyll keep coming all the time cause they want the easy wayso agree totally with dokja hes not wrong or baddeserve so muchyesss ugh that was satisfyingslice oh your arm hit my blade congrats youve lost a couple of pounds loseryou seem confused you dont have power over him because he cant kill every single one of you you had power over him because he didnt want to that white thing are cute lol yet scaryso should i just ignore that there was no comments for the past few chapterswhats so bad becoming a villainoh yeah things are starting to get interestingbihyeong is taking me out dokjas character is interesting than most protagonists ive ever seenwait hold on arent we the readers the constellations in this casehe unlocked the rinnesharingan thats all i gotta sayhan myungoh had around thoque delicia finalmente um enche linguia dessa apanhando morality doesnt even exist in this world anymore it all depends on the persons values and dokjas got pretty unpredictable values im sure he cares about the people he considers his team now and he even saved huiwon without expecting to gain anything in return which is odd cause hes been doing things for his own benefit he also lied to gilyeong so hed still have some hopeoptimismgod im loving dokjaman i love this but it makes sense since his whole thing is like im not the protagonist so why should i be a herogileyeong has a power to communicate with animals how cooolhe is sothe constellation loves the mche should at least give the coins back to the people that bought food he knew they would charge coins to live and took advantage not cooli like it dokja kim sharing is caring my ass idk but i like dokjaright decisionno hesitation i like ityeeess go tell em bruhhyou know i feel sorry for the small children unless their parents held someonesomething down and mental scarred by having them kill the children died dokja makes jin woo look like a saint lmaohe is starting to look slowly but surely like sung jinwoomorally gray characters like erenaotare really interesting for me its great to have new types of characters from time to timebihyeong really turned from to this duck morality i love a hero which can very well be a villain honestly i would be selfish too if i was in this situation and only give coins for the people that i actually cared about im glad dokjas not tryna be the good guyhero bc if i was in his position i wld not wanna share any of my coins eitherwe live the dokja character development dokja kinda reminds me of ainz ooal gown from overlord i love him i might change my nameoh he got cakeit just had to be the praying mantisdokjas i nice guy people pls share coins riot happen they blame him im going to kill you with one of the sickest smilesim hookedsharing is caring to thoes only who deserves it dokja really just said no cuz i happened to miss the part where i cared fukin disintegrate them all alreadyistg bihyeong is so cuteeehes hotlmao uuu jahat tapi hot nicee i love dokjadokja is not good but it is not bad either his on the middle i like it his personality is not based on the moralim impressedshawty got bundaaahes certainly no hero because he needs to survive this world and its not like hes a villain or bad guy hes just a guy who randomly became a main character and was forced into a situation where he had to adapt to surviveyesdokjas expression i love his evil side oh yeah this is sickjeanhenri fabre lol come on ppl hes not a saintdidnt the mr han guy get like coins from killing the the warden of darknessi dont like how he looks down on them when he isnt a good person himself but i guess he did say he was a hypocrite anywayshahahahif u bastards really want the coins backthen give the food back as well im reading this thinking what if this comes realdokja knows what up  gilyeong was able to interact with a monarch insect and that deserves a round of applause  thanks for the amazing episode authors nageenjoy ako ritodokja pogi damn you can make a pixel game with that artdokja is becoming cooler by every episode zjhajaim like dokja and he did great in this survival game only care about yourself and the people you actually care about your comrades you dont need other peoples favor because it wont keep you alive dokja already has people who trusts him and would stay with him he doesnt need to put up with those pathetic people in a survival game lite that theres ni room for pity and kindness to random peopledo you really blame me for this situationi got chills from this fr i alreadyknow this whole webtoon finna be goodgoddamn dokja finally a protagonist thats an antagonistwhat if gilyeong turns into a villainhoneyof course i dont   i like his characterthem greedy side characters smh her child murdered somebodylooks like my dude is true neutral goodpath to villainy here we goohe didnt kill anyone yet but almost everyone thats begging him to share some of his coins is a fcking murderer if youre gonna take a life be responsible and accept the damn consequences accept it overcome it and live for the damn person you killedackkyessthe constellation picky unbiased masquerade is amused this character isnt as good to be a foolthis is perfect its my favorite type of mc yess finallyyes boi yes dokja why should iinsert blue fademe bruuuhh saaammemy concience sliding away quietlyyo i love him to be fair hes not wrongoh shit bihyeong is adorable i fukin hate that thing goosebumps mann so coolman this is why i love korean comics if this was japanese manga the mc would be one self righteous softy that plays heroim really loving this webtoon dokja is giving major light yagami vibes that caught me so off guard goodbyethe character development is soo goodthe people sharing is caring dokja no its communismat first i disagree with dokjas actions but in second thought i realized he was really just fending for himself while it seemed like dokja swindled coins from the crowd knowing that the food he sold would vanish anyway and thus decreasing their chances of survival he only did it because the pressure was placed unto him plus he really didnt anticipate that survival fee so the incited mob were just reaping the consequences of their gullibility in letting themselves be manipulatedthe constellation ybahmedd laughs at the despair of those who tried to kill dokjayasssi genuinely love the fact that dokja is an antihero heyy our favorite fluffy pokemon is back oh my goshh hes so cool i love himmdamniminluvre leerlo es asombroso como siempre a main character whos merciless huh new to me but im looking forward to this edit if this ever happened in real life i wouldve done the same thing nglim not hating in the least but i love the influence solo leveling had in breaking more mcs away from the traditional build dokja is a bossdokja bye bye arms stan dokja and his cake jk pls he is so hot i feel like eating him wwowwthis is really awesome byebye armsomg omgdokja is developing moral is a creation of the previous world in this world moral dont existoh damn o he got unarmed omgkirito ngh dokjaam i the only one who thinks hes hoti love dokjas character smoh god hes so hothdjdjfwhjsthcdamnlike you should only get help if you deserve that if not dont make moral excuse rightwhy there is no music im literally being so loud right now just rooting for himanti heroi just hope the others dont lose trust in him for this because hes not even in the wrong tbhbro why tf is he built like the mc from tomb raider king all the characters have a really big similaritytjats my boynice dokjatbh im agree with dokja dokja is my unbothered king idk i think he is weeding out the evil people to help the good ones i think morally he does have the high ground on thisi am so curious at to the type of person dokja ishe isnt a hero and not a villian eitherwell i meannn itll just be a nuisance if this type of people actually surviveskraaazythese people knew what was coming and if they have other people like kids or elderly to pay for as well hold off on food for a day if needed do something anything to get them that doesnt involve waiting til the last minute and going mental on this guy that worked hard for his im so glad he didnt back down or cave in to this worthless leaders gamesplop went his handgooddd my manpeople really get crazy when they are about to die why did they come back aywaysyes yes its starting to be interesting i love dokjathese idiots why did i laugh tho whats wrong with mewhy should he give them his coins they are just going to die soon i doubt theyll even make it the next payment point thats a complete waste thats not being a villain thats just being smart do what you have to to survive i love how our mc is moral or immoral depending on the situation its refreshing that hes not % moral or % immoral dokja is really out here explaining the theme sharing is not caringthe goon squad was so ready to attack pathetic scum he aint rich for nothing dokja worked very hard to get the coins and the weapons he worked very hard to level up to survive so what right do those people who have done nothing but living on other peoples efforts just like a parasites have to ask him to give them coinshes just surviving with a reason guys no need to be so poopy i completely agree with this decision because as shitty as it is this is the reality of this world and he knows that things cant go back to normal and if theres a wish that can then if they die at this point it wont matter so rather increase his chances as much as possible right now and keep as many coins to himself as possible because if they have to depend on him to get coins they wont survive in the future eitheryes finally hes not dumb and trying to act like a hero like other mc in every storyiesamen to that you made your bed so lie in itwowdokkaebi looking cute rnone pair of hand is gone pair moreyou are special you are loved black swordsman oo this mans looks like nothing but a main character bruhspoiler warning please dont read this comment if you arent far enough how does this not count towards him not having ever killed anyonedamnnn i wonder what the others are gonna think of him nowsige lang dokja maging demonyo kapa hahahahah noicei wonder how many coins dokja have nowhow come the mr han is still alive what was the curse imposed on himabahhahahahahha bihyeoks wink was cutei really want sokka at some point to pick secretive plotter since they seem to have the same mischievous actionstime to put that op sword to a good useaccording to what he said i believe that he doesnt want to share something worthy with murderersdokja aku padamu  he reminds me of the anime darwin game damn that was a really good anime for mei love it i love it i love every single episode of this story situation aaahh periodt hands sikee one last chapter i swear im gonna sleepmahak na ata kita dokja aa wjshsbsjsisjjsjsjsyeah dokja rat bastard my beloved secretive plotter is such a bro well well i would have made first attack if i was mci brought the food you eat it and now talk about refundgah daymndokja is a slytherin for surehonestly i would just lie and said id spent all my coins on the sweet new sword sorry not sorrycool theres no mercy for dishonest gangsters give us back our coins give me back my foodhonestly the people got that far by killing at the very least they could try to complete the scenarios although people in crisis rarely think rationally especially with that shit startertiny bihyeong his legs were cut off his arms were cut offi would stand in line for thistheres always room in life for thisoo shwapfuc tht these ppl hav no shame just latchin on him for free everytimepove how the psycho faces are drawngo off dokjacommunismayy pop off you bastard and i oophell yeah boiii fuckouttahere with that weakass shitthats right kill them allmario yesbruuhhe didnt do anything wrongwhy do ppl blame himits not his fault all their food got abductedwhat was the scenario again wouldnt they get out of paying if they just completed iti better not see one constellation complainy e a h d o k j a the anti hero yesshehehehe gold diggersthis is so excitingthats how you play with these mfspls kid dont think bad about him you are sharp you know that is not his fult rightinsanity its kinda like letting a murder off his or hers sentence you wouldnt do that so why would he have to help them when they have nothing useful for him agree with his pov can somebody clarify if the completion of scenarios accects every member of the group or just who is fulfilling the requirementsi wouldve have said what do i get for or prove your worth because these guys are just desperate anywayi would have paid them off in order to recruit an army to deal with inho with people dependent on dokja for food and then their very lives he could easily seize control of the station but i suppose power isnt his goalnot a single coin spent herewowowowowowim glad they are finally fighting those bastards constellation water sound and wind sound wanna see biyu asapgilyeong is so cute omghell yeah dokja go offf u are a literal icon i love this story so muchhow can you expect someone to be morally good if you yourself are not morally goodsee how filthy humans can be arent they ashame tsk tsk tskwhy is it the more not nice but not evil makes they more hotoops this quickly turn into horror huh hshshyeonseongshi is so precious i want to protect him like holy poop hes so cute hhnnnggg dif i were him i would only help the people who were close with me and part of my group the women the boy and the other mani like this side of dokja i think dokja will end up as an antivillain or an antihero as we can see here he is still a good guy but has some evil qualities by not sharing his coins though i do agree with his decisionmeanwhile ima take a guess as to who sangahs constellation is httpsenwikipediaorgwikiariadne and dont tell me if im righti know hes seems like hes turing to a villain but i bet this is something hes doing just to scare them he really doesnt want to be the bad guyim so glad he isnt a generic character this is getting so gooddio you dare challenge meyes pop off he pulled a iq on them wonder how hes going to make it outyeah i am glad that he didnt just follow what that dude said but insincere he did this the people around will

its an apocalypse people you are responsible for your own life and can that rat myeongoh han just die hes annoying afthe content creator is working up a battle im expecting a hell war to break loose next chapterevil mc boi this is so funny yeah think the man could spare us some coinsthere wasnt any point in sharing coins the situation would repeat once and again and in the end people would still die and hed be in an unfavourable situation with little to no coins he is not assessing the situation morally but practically in the long run he cannot really help themyuh dokja just snappedwelp natural selection bishes morals wont save you rn and thats how that man became withered chicaactually i liked dokjas decision as all the people there didnt had any morals right now & they are just burdens with selfish motivesits apocalypse do i have time to be nice i dont think sogod im so glad dokja isnt some kind of a saint too naive to just give coins to those people thats the reality you gotta knock or even slice some arms to give sense to some people loli love dis me whenever someone wants me to share my food because they think ill always be kind to them ughumm this is interesting i like this approach hes takingdont you dare and now a wild freezo from dragon friends appears witchbolt some mudda fuqasfreedom isnt freeim ok with this hehehehe yes haha yes i love where this is headingthis is getting better and better yesanime slicethats right i dont think he is in the wrong on fighting back like this likewhy should he be the target for blame cuz one guy says so everyone has their limits on how much they can help period dokjadamn this webtoon is gold keep up the good work manthis is soo my favorite webtoon i love the storyline along with characters and the drawing stylewhat a badasshis plan is to break the control of that influencer he is truly a terrifying villain he has to take him out before he levels up morewhy does this feel like fallout soo much dat buttshit i wanna sword like thatme reading episode on seriesalso me wow i like thems artsanyone say antihero because i thought i heard antihero lmaotell em dokjai thought dokja was just going to say myeonghan has coins to spare so he doesnt become the villain and doesnt lose coinsyou tell em dokjai didnt think this would be so good during the first few chapters im glad i didnt drop itwoeiooww theses people i want to fucking straggle themwow so much thought was put into this webcomicoooh this is getting excitingbihyung why you look so cuteguys be ready for the unpredictable scammer kim dojegai love they changed the perspective and made it seem like he was the bad guy and good guy at the same timei am loving this series so muchgreen shirt dudeim going to kill youdokja  nopepeople people attack the other dudehe looks scaryi like itohohoh some gonna die tonightthis is badhow can they just say that likethey should try to prove thier worth instead of trying to kill him like how dumb are youhe have more coins because of some reason peoplehes right though why should he give them coins also if he did the next time the fee shows up they are going to rely on him to give them coins then it turns into a cycle which might end him with no coinsi like the fact that the others are still behind him obviously positioned to protect himyesss use logic not moralitygod damn this boy has some principles and im excited to see them like of course u ugly dead meats why would he do that hes not ur legal guardian or anything square the fk upi called there was gonna be a giant mantis i knew itthis is amazing dokja is awesome i always love a badass character damn my jaw lower than my short a of yess hes backwait wait wait wait wait he can essentially borrow skills right what if he borrows incite to turn everyone against the guy who was sending people out in the first placethis story isnt exactly one of my favorites rn but it just gets more and more interesting every chapter wtfffsharing is caring kidswhat he meant by being villainholy sh he can like get it well he is like some scrifics for greater goodim with him on this f^ck those guysepic reader is pleased with your decisionmaking yess flying hands all we need to see come on dokja you could have just lent the guy a handhe continuously tries to make himself the only sacrifice while everyone else can survive damndaamn i love him slay bich slay them allwhat i think he should do is give them coins but only if they give him the survival reward so they all live gain respect for dokja and he also gets his coins backman even tho bihyeong is kinda a ass he gets better on in later scenesfinally a character who is looking out for themselves before other people its refreshing bihyeongthank god i was praying that he didnt give the coinskinda reminds me of this situationkids at lunch buy lunch food even thought they sat its badthese guys bought food with their coins both of them still gobble that shit up fast ngl i would do the sameyes i have been waiting for this and im loving it inho sharing is caring dojka shut the fck updat ass i the last panel thodokja isnt a villan per say but hes also not the

favorite characterhes an anti heroi love the morality of dokja he makes such a thrilling character to have as the narrator and lead in so many other stories he would have just flown under the radar

dando de moralista como si fuera un santo pero tampoco abusa de lo que tiene estoy de su lado totalmente uwumyungoh cant be long for this world wonder what will happen to all of those coins when he becomes a mother or is murdered by the demon king of whatever and how many people that could have given a chancei knew that bug would be important since it was the only normal giant looking creature that we have seen so faredit but i never thought a normal giant insect would have the rank of a monarch thanks soo dokaebi communication is basically private chat love how he doesnt give a care in the world lets be honest this is a realistic way of looking at things damn those eye bags tho our poor dokja isnt getting enough sleep he is the goat so what if he has cheat codes its all about self in the endi i am speechless hahaha the dokakabi is acting all shy and jealous cus dokja did something awesome and he wasnt their to gain credit for the stream dokakabi so ugh noticed wile i was away you did some pretty amazing stuffwhat i felt he was trying to say you dont like the other guy better righthis arms got sliced off so quick even he had to say huh have you all been well while i was away ~dont spoil us with daily updates and then leave us hanging like this come get these coinsi really hate when people just want others to help them but they never do some to help others f them gilyoung becomes the master of all insects in futurewow dokja that was ummmkinda hot when you pretend to be secretive plotter but i would send more like coins to dokja for doing what he just did lolwelp i saw

thinking and moral reasoning if neededoh no hes very pissed offim here and i regret nothingthe constellation hanae_saku liked dokja a lot coins have been awarded i used the free coins earned for an event because i want to support the artist i hope to read moregosh dangit i want more i just fast forward using all my coins and i dont regretno one is good they wanto still moneyi cant wait for more updates im all about the daily uploads i will gladly spend my money for this webtoonbut from what i read this guy is pretty much the line and does who desire to disrupt that line is considered an annoyance i for one respect that is there a new chapter every dayman i really hate praying mantis even as it isinlove yeess we needed this dokja doesnt deserve to take smack from anyone show em whos boss imagine spending all of your weeks worth of lunch money for coins without your parents knowledge i think i messed upi dont remember what the little demon is thats controlling the game but i like the guy i know hes demonic and all but i still like himi like him as a character not the other wayfirst time reader opinions i think dokja is about to learn a new bookmark skill but what would happen if two incite skills clashed interesting to see indeedlove this omgf u f them what makes me the enemy love this twist and realismour protagonist is such a badass i love his reasoning and how he can be so cold sometimesi think im going to reread this webtoon from the very beginning its just so very goodi feel bad at how easily they are corrupted always a great read im definitely hoping you an get funding for a tv showcant stress the notouch policy enough these daysgotta love characters that do what they need to survive and dont puss up at every turngetting super tasty lemme see tha da next clup pleaze kind sirwell if theyd actually work harder they would have coins like dokja said they killed someone to stay and why should this be his problem go boy chop chopthe constellation greedy storyarc devourer alpha thinksdikja should buy the peoples loyalty if they want coins he should get something in return the constellation greedy storyarc devourer alpha thinks dokja should go ahead and kill that dudeis this still going to update daily this mights just be me but im begging you to keep it that waywow thats cool the blooded dont dokija but it is the bosses followed because hes just being a prickthis sword is so epicbased neutral oh i love dokjathe crowd is about to turn on the people who sold the food for triple the amount im glad dokja isnt a pussy idiot mcyes dokja god i love dokja this was amazing im thrilled i love thiss story now that is what i call chaotic good set the tone dok clear out the useless extras and then get onto the villainsyes dokja defend yourselfsheesh dude aint playin no games with yallthe dude in the red at the end looks like he shat himselfomg this man just went sicko mode so beautiful there deadyoobeautiful so god damn beautiful damn bro dokja turning hella sick nowi really love how many twist and turns this story takes but when dokja goes cold face he says f those twist and turns ones desire to live should never delve to the depths of unnecessary violence applaud the player for their insight and not blame their ability to do well when others flounderidk what webtoon i love more this or the gamertake my money but in a serious note who can blame him or the people its about to go down i greatly approve of dokja our mc right now i mean he still has the moral high ground most of those people are there because they killed someone and still refuse to be responsible for their own lives or actions why should he help them it would actually be pointless since they wouldnt learn anything morally the right action is to let them suffer the consequences for their choices so that if they survive maybe theyll change on their owni would like a psycho mc hehe am getting tired of the good and cringey onesim so glad dokja doesnt have the saviour complex that most mcs tend to have dthiss i mean i dont like the character who always been taken advantage by others i love how he isnt a very morally goody shoeshes like its an apocalypse frick u toomy spirit animal kim dokjai love not morally good protagonists dokja has such an amazing characteri just wanna say i love you all so much thank you for creating this webtoon ugh im so glad dokja isnt a pushover and wont just do whatever benefits everyone else also hes so coolnice mc vibesi hope that this doesnt have any smart clever outcome and dokja just butchers all the fools who thinks he owes them anything dokja is so woke dokja and his gang are the ppl i wanna hang out with i love me a morally grey character this is the definition of let your inner demon shineeethe audacity of these people is rlly out of hand you ate his food that he risked his life for youve done n o t h i n g at all youre not entitled to his helpthis guy is the definition of virtue signalingyeah you tell em kdj fricking idiots xdauthor nim youre the bestyes this is a realistic character why did i wait so long to read this loving the antihero twist other than the pushover mcsim sorry but thats hotdokja is turning out to be the anti hero type hes good but he will kill if he has todokja is more and more reminding me of sung jin woohahahahahah hahahahhahahaahahhaahhahahhaahahahahaahahhaathat character who got his arms cut off surprised pikachu faceoverhaul i know how that feelshippity hoppity my coins are your propertyumm that was hot  a whole new meaning of disarming your enemysometimes being a villain is far better than being a hero woa some people in these comments genuinely scare me where is your humanity why are so many people so happy the mc might not be a good guy when did being a good person become boring if this was a real scenario and you genuinely wouldnt help people when you could at least the children in this crowd then idk what to say but you need to think about what kind of person you are damn papi you a rare breedhah this is why i absolutely love coldquiet people they al always have an interesting instinct being a villain is better than hero in my perspectiveever protagonists says how pathetic in a scary way with there pupil dilated i dont think i have ever loved a mc more than i love him i truly hate self righteous mcsat first i was like mhmm men with swords as a joke but bro i dont think its a joke anymore love how he reacted this webtoon is amazing through all but the mc makes it times better the world they live in is twisted i know but the mc is right for many reasons im seriously going to start crushing on himdokja reminds me of khun from tower of godi love that its not your typical righteous protagonist give me some realityidk about anyone else but i was like finally my godddgreatt character development so realistic and not idealistic tbh i would prob do the same being a good person is cool now but in a situation like that its jst being weak its jst letting others manipulate u for personal gain at that point i would sorta jst be like fuck ityes finally a character whos not a bitch this is why i loved solo levelingfinally he is all out of mercynice i like that they are just evilhe has every right not to give them coins they killed ppl he can use that as an excuse if he doesnt wanna seem evil cuz he killed bugsi think children at least deserve your help but at the end its a survival of the fittest scenario not a charitymost of the people there killed other people to survive so why should he give coinsi like the way dojka just helps people that actually does need it and i honestly love the way he is not stick on being the good ass guy but instead a fair one literally loving itdokja doesnt take shit and i love it so much pathetic humansused all their coins and blame someone else for their stupidity trash deserves to be destroyedits the apocalypse my dudes ahhi stand by dokjahe is doing the right thing i dont see these people doing anything to live other than just surviving theres a big difference they took human life to get where they are now coins each thats more nights of life or instead of squatting they could you know work on the scenarios at hand  dokja is taking the moral high groundyessdokja is awesome hes the best protag ever we needed a grey character dokja is so hottt and smartttyeesslmao i mean these people killed others to get to the next scenariowhat did they expect from dokja hell yea dont blame someone who did not even do any bad things or do the things that will gonna ruin your lifeyou would think after living most of their lives in capitalism they would understand how it worksif you like mcs like this you should read tomb raider im saying this cuz it kinda similar kinda but the mcs r similar though not the story well the story plot line is but read it if your interested knew it but still dont regret itim simping so hard rnoh god hes so cool help meyayyy hes back i am officially a dokja worshippermanga has more chapters if anybody wants to check it outi just finished the novel and now i dont know how to react i came here to see our idiot kim dokja he really needs to tone down his crazinessmaann can i just say that face he made was super fking hot like mmi give coin for himdokja has a point although he did sell them food for coins it does not mean that he should have to be forced to give them back his coins for the decision they made also they all have commit murder and probably more sins that no one know dokja earn those with his in strategies that ending scene was fire  as wellim just wondering how his friends will react to this i mean i kind of agree with him but i hope his friend dont turn on himdojka kinda reminds me of dream omg he is so badass i love him  and ugh this comic is soo underrated like most of the romance webtoon a are given more attention which is fine but they miss gems like these idk why but this gives me solo leveling vibessave humankind once and for all was not a good addition to the webtoon summary since kim dokjas goal has never been for the safety of humanityscammer dokjaachapter of waiting for yoo sangah in a black chinese dress and garter beltyou mortals i already read chapter that moment when u already read the chapters illegally super idol     c i love dokja i really love his personality       yessdokja you want ur money back ok il give it everyone yes ill live we get too li dokja ill give it once i get my food back in its original stateeverybody in the world know im a little twisted twisted~ sing along whit me peopleon my motherfucking knees dokja please my throat is so emptyhes ah so cool feel like want to cry _yeah kill those bastards like how sung jinwoo killed those lizard bastardsthis is a bomb omglmaooohahah that was hilariousnoicei love this guy thinking about real sht and not caring if people like him or not he being realthats reality for u btches well done dokja youre the realistic character among alllove you dokjanoop you aint got arms no morethats rightwhy should he slackers and freeloaders must die im sry but i have to say it dokja is the # antihero right nowsolo leveling vibes looks exactly like sung jin woo in the last paneli came for the ga my bad wrong comici totally didnt read chapters after this on a website coolyou go dokja chop them offwiat evil rich guy has the most coins like hes like nope ima gonna walk out of this nobidy saw me get those coinsdoes seriously no one see anything wrong with this though like what is going to do with all those coins anyways why does he need so much its seems to me like its easy for him to get coins anyways since he has so many advantages it reminds me of those billionaires who dont even share their wealthi got here in minits tbh they should have simply ended the scenarioi still think that dokja is actually the villain from the last chapter of the story the final bossdo you really blame them you idiot wow so slow i have already read all this chapters dont waste your money on this webtoon theres a website that you can read for free now there are over chapters in the website so dont waste your money hes so hot but doesnt he not have the most coins if i remember correctly someone earned coins hmmm dayum why everyone is so john these days lelomg

people give me coins for my webtoons omg i love dokja  especially like this lazy people who arent taking selfaccountability into consideration for their own lives and actions should not live off others what is this procapitalism trash im all about mercy and kindness but i would reacted the same way how dare you use me as a escape goat for your plan how dare you blame me for the fact you chose to stay in the station how dare you try to kill me for trying to keep you from anothers clutches gotta show some fear to be respected sometimes needy people sharing is caring me im not a care bear im personally just annoyed of the finally protagonist that does something morally questionable as if every protagonist of these types of stories werent some sort of anti heroes who everytime they do something morally righteous they are like nah nah im doing this definitely for selfish reasonslike not crapping on peoples tastes here im just confused if they really dont realize that majority of web novel series have similar protagonists to here or make choice seem less edgy lateri dont disagree with dokjas choice but couldnt he have said that mr han has more momey than him even if its a liei hate how the main character is slowly turning into a psycho i really pains methis is a lesson on why socialism is doodoogee ive never had top comment trump is like the dokkaebi making rules that cost lives lots of people will dieso wait if he lets everyone have a bite of the food wouldnt that complete the scenario for everyone so they wouldnt all lose coins unless im missing a stepi really appreciate that hes not willing to get pushed around thoughhe is kind of a bitch dont like him for looking down on those people just because he got lucky and happend to read the right story he wouldve been on their place if he didnt well no actually he would be dead from that edgeguy from the train i dont mean he should give his money to everyone but at least dont be a brat thinking they all deserved that maybe they killed insects too who knowshes lee gilyeong not gilyeong lee why you do this its korean webcomic why the names are written like in eu or america dud this shit just annoys meseriously a episode pay wall              wow so slow i have already read all this chapters dont waste your money on this webtoon theres a website that you can read for free now there are over chapters in the website so dont waste your money there are other platforms that has episode and it free im staying cause theres a slim chance of hope but this is total garb_ age i mean come on just kill the sk m already & those r_ tards as well gods sakedojka seems kind of hypocritical to me he helps out only the people he knows he even helps that little boy but when there is another child that needs coins to survive he turns a blind eye i get not giving coins to the other people but at least for childrenthe thing is that author intentionally made those plain people become evil and start blaming him so he can keep looking down on them but not all are like that and in real life there would probably be more people just crying or begging then stratight attacking him so i find him a total bitch for being that arrogant he couldve done something for example really share coins with the rest who didnt attack him it wouldnt be much at all and he would probaby get even more as donation for his deedhe couldve killed the major group and gave their coins to those in need totally so fck this mc hypocrite or he coudlve at least tried to do smth maybe he will in next chapter but i doubtcharacter i have black hair commenter his hair is black whiner omg how dare you spoil it do you all realize how ridiculous you sound when you whine about spoiling have none of you ever read a book ex harry potter then find out it gets made into a movie and be excited for it anyways even though you already know everything that happens from beginning to end like seriously spoilers dont actually spoil anything you still enjoy the the cartoonmovie get the hell over yourselvesplease dont speak in absolutes i dont think the story progressed far enough youve given us yoo the main protagonist given broken faith a buff then gave it to the reader and you giving the a powerful judge power to jung slow down and progress the story it will just become a story of absolutes and we dont even know his goals or what striving for this will just be like a meaningless power fantasy in sea of trash power fantasies\n"

      "Im happy with this twist im sick of characters who try so hard to stick to the moral high ground i‚Äôm really interested to see dokja‚Äôs developement at this point since he‚Äôs clearly not going to be a ‚Äògood‚Äô character i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be straight up evil but i‚Äôm excited to see the extent of his neutrality at the very least the people ‚Äúsharing is caring‚Äù dokja i don‚Äôt care person_shrugging‚Äçmale_signÔ∏è edit just to clarify i don‚Äôt disagree with dokja‚Äôs decision i just thought it was funny how people were trying to get him to maintain a high ‚Äúmoral ground‚Äù but he was just like nah this an apocalypse my dudesfinally a mc that makes the most optimal choice ive been getting bored of mcs always trying to be the herofor real though aside from the people dokja originally saved with the bugs everyone is a murderer they have a lot of audacity to be begging for their lives i‚Äôm down with dokja‚Äôs pragmatismwait i just noticed look at the panel when dokja cuts the guys arms you see that he is facing away from his group then look at the last panel you can see that he has his back now turned to the guy whose arms he cut off and his body is facing towards his group so that means that this man just cut the guys arms off turned around and then look over his shoulder to flex on all these people xdthis really is gonna be the best webtoon on the app and if they end up making an anime adaption you know it‚Äôll go crazyi really like the approach to an antihero type of character it‚Äôs nice to see someone who is intelligent but doesn‚Äôt magically make all the right decisions it makes him seem really human mostly fending for himself great work author please keep it up them gimme coinsdokja whythem ugh let‚Äôs just kill him and take the coinsdokja mistake slashthem pikachu surprised facei guess the guy at the end there was ‚Äúdisarmed‚Äù eh ehhlol why didnt he just let everybody know about the k coins the cursed guy with the suit hascrowd give me a refund dokja sorry there is a no refund policy give us coins dokja i missed the part where thats my problem this webtoon along with solo leveling is all i am looking forward to every weekcrowd let me get thatdokja its gone cost you an arm and legthey had time to complete the quest but they where sitting there all that time just crying about it and now its his fault pathetic pretty sure sangah has ariadne as her constellation ariadne is sometimes seen as the goddess of mazes and is credited with giving theseus a ball of string to find his way out of the minotaurs labyrinth i mean that was so iconic from that story it just seems too coincidental i dont know if a japanesekoreanchinese myth involving string exists to provide an alternative i honestly think that his decision is the goodone he needs verification that anyone he gives coins to will at least be able to offer something to him in exchange if they dont then they wouldnt be surviving very long anyways if he helped them it would probably just make them suffer longer with no hope of actually surviving and acclimating to the new world order i mean they couldnt muster coins dokja gets that much as a gift from the constellations all the timethe first theme being original sin would that mean the second theme is survival of the fittest he wouldnt be doing any of them a favor by handing out coins for free as they would be bound to the other guy they would rather take the easy path and just kill him when all they really need to do is offer either an item of their own or their services in future runs its how society is supposed to work in the grand scheme of things where all parties work at their own pace to contribute manager dude got k coins last chapter let him save the peoplem i think my favorite constellation is the secret plotterhes right he worked for his coins even with his knowledge he still had to accomplish those things to get an award this webtoon touches a lot of areas in society and its great thank you author for amazing comic i think the facts come down too no one has a moral high ground here like he said original sin they all murdered someone to be alive right now so the fact they expect some one to save them after that is ludicrous no one is good or evil here it‚Äôs just survival for survivals sakedokja is also not dokja i believe he is the omniscient reader otherwise he would cling to humanity and sins for example he would had tried to save as many people as possible but instead decided to let them choose their fates he knows what to do and how to do it instead of morals he thinks with the most logic very interesting and also very hard to stay on that path having the ability of the fourth wall also helped in move forward resistant to fear charm taunts very powerful indeedhe made a good point they all killed someone to get pass the first scenario even that little kid so if you dont take care of yourself then you dont deserve to live money grabbers jesus fcking christ the audacity of those assholesi cant wait to see inho cheon get whats coming to him relieved_face gonna be even more satisfying than watching little han boy become a mother pregnant_womanedit these arent spoilers this is just what i hope happensthrow myeongeh under the bus he‚Äôs got coins nowi love it when the main character doesnt stick to moral values like theyre in the apocalypse and they expect people to still follow the moral code even tho most if not all of then already killed someone i love love love dokja‚Äôs character i am incredibly sick of ‚Äúgood‚Äù characters that make stupid decisions because ‚Äúit‚Äôs the right thing to do‚Äù i‚Äôm fed up with the moral high ground obviously he‚Äôs not a bad guy either he‚Äôs just selfish and i don‚Äôt find anything wrong with placing your survival first he is not responsible for these peoplejean henri fabre was a french naturalist in the late s known for his books on the lives of insects if anyone‚Äôs curiousis it just me or does dokja get hotter with each passing episode i love how he looks i love how he doesnt take bull look at him hes one of the many reasons why my standards are skyrocketinggod im already so spoiled with this one episode a day lol easily my top series cant wait for morei think the important thing here is regardless of whether or not sharing coins is the moral thing dokja not letting himself be manipulated is better in the long run leaving a mob under incite‚Äôs control will only hurt him in the end not to mention giving those coins would be like taking responsibility for those lives it‚Äôs too much for anyone to really bare people are saying that he wasn‚Äôt keeping a moral high ground or that the people were telling him to keep a moral high ground and he wouldn‚Äôt but i think that he‚Äôs still got a moral high ground these people the moment they were manipulated or had to think things through resorted to murder and that‚Äôs exactly what he expected of them so why give them coins why trust them i think that despite his looks saying ‚Äòneutral chaotic with evil‚Äô it‚Äôs more like ‚Äòlawful chaotic with a moral compass‚Äôi see dokja as a survivor not good or bad just trying to livefinally this mc action makes sense in an apocalyptic world hes not bad but smarti love how they try to attack him he fights back and their expression is surprised pikachu face i don‚Äôt seem to follow why people have been saying this makes them evil they threw their own lives away unable to beat their inner fear and even attempt to survive it would be a waste to save someone like that in fact i‚Äôd say saving them just to force them into more suffering would be the evil choice if they are unable to even try and survive for themselves why not just let their suffering end it seems cruel on the surface but dokjas got a point in not being too generous people who live passively and allow themselves to get manipulated by relying on charity and sponsorships wont survive if their supporters suddenly decide to leave them be its true in the scenario and in this reality toodokja is not the protagonist of twsa so he will have to take hard and clever decisions in order to survive this game till the endand its much more fun to see him not following the moral valueshe really does look like a villain in that lase slide its so awesome no wonder the constellations are interested in him coins just means you‚Äôre alive one more day to beg for even more coins it‚Äôd be a waste hopefully dokja mentions boss man‚Äôs moniesalso i love he gave hyunsung lee a shield and lee loves him now they‚Äôre bros gotta max out that affinitydokja an actually good main characterseriously as if he‚Äôs some high level monster that you can defeat and he‚Äôll just drop coins why don‚Äôt they just break some pottery and pray for rupees do they deserve my help its an important question he cant be expected to shoulder the weight of all these people through the whole apocalypse at some point they need to stand up for themselvesi love how the author sets dokja apart while inho says ‚Äúreturn the coins to the people‚Äù it sounds like he is doing it for the good of the people and dokja‚Äôs ‚Äúand if i refuse‚Äù sounds villainess but he‚Äôs the main character and it‚Äôs refreshing that he isn‚Äôt a morally bound person but at the same time hasn‚Äôt tipped too far off that has left him insane in this situation this is absolutely one of my favorite webtoons by far and i rarely read anything other than heartwarming and romantic webtoonsfirst they wanted free food next they were too scared to help him kill the giant rats for coins third when they came back they asked for free coins thinking that he would give after that they tried to kill him and expected him to be a sitting duck finally they have the audacity to be surprised that he sliced someones arms offhonestly i love dokja‚Äôs character he‚Äôs rational and doesn‚Äôt let his emotions take the reins over his decisions he‚Äôs the embodiment of someone going against the world‚Äôs corruption while not utilizing the common ‚Äúgood prevails‚Äù trope i‚Äôm % looking forward to his journeyhyunsung lee has started to trust youdokja hmmm i can use thisi agree with dokja there‚Äôs no reason for him to help these people specially in the situation they‚Äôre inthe mc did the right decision because if they can survive just that one scenario how will they survive the next one those people is so pathetic the mc help them for food then they will blamed him for losing of coinsexpressionless_facei don‚Äôt need sleep i need the next episodeyay a gray area characterpeople who rely on others too much usually drag down the whole group because they always expect you to save them and feed of the kindness of others in a survival situation you have to either drag them with you and risk getting the whole squad killed or you have to leave them behind to save those who are able to stand alone i think dokja made the right decision because it would mean hed have to take care of a bunch of people even in the future that is not a longterm solutioni feel like dokja is more rational than evil as people are saying he makes smart decisions and calls based on logic everybody is talking about the moral high ground and how hes evil when mans is making rational decisions and being smart hes neither good nor evil hes j a guy with a rational mindthis comics unreleased episodes are starting to make me agree with coins are poweri love dokja‚Äôs personality in my opinion he is correct this is the apocalypse and he isn‚Äôt obliged to help everyone everyone brought food because they were hungry it‚Äôs their own decision what does dokja have to do with it if they wanted coins earn it themselves it‚Äôs every man for themselves i love this author already theyre the first to actually show you when the veil of civilization is torn apart by apocalypse even after murdering another person to survive these people are acting dependant on others if they dont fend for themselves no one will fight for them anymore beautiful storytellingthats one the the reasons i really like this story the mc is quite different from the standar hero see-no-evil_monkey ill support him as far as he dont betray his team relieved_faceOK_handdam i caught up to quickly again i‚Äôm so happy that‚Äôs he‚Äôs releasing quickly and with great quality i‚Äôll keep spending coins as long as they keep coming people i know that there are some people who came here from the webnovel but for those of us who are reading it for thw first time on webtoon dont google anything about omnimicent reader because it will just most likely spoil the manwha for you like it did for meedit did anyone else love hyeonseongs face when he was holding the shieldthis is absolutely perfect dokja maintains logical thinking in a time where it would be necissary to do so so it actually makes sense he isnt a hero just a guy a lucky guy but a guy nonethelessnone of you can say that dokja isnt good he doesnt do bad things he just does what is needed to survive moral ground wont work in apocalyptic world he didnt use them he just simply did what was best for him so i really like his decisiondokja badassdokja in the end of the story fucking badassü•¥well this is real interesting dokja is a unique protagonist and i absolutely love italthough those background characters are hella annoying for being hypocrites their reactions and actions are all natural i mean who did expect this to happen not even dokja dokja is lucky enough to have knowledge about the overall situation also its understandable as to why theyre afraid to go out for the quest i mean their families and friends didnt come back after they joined something like that true neutral character coming throughas a mother i say kill the greedy bastards and save the children but as a lover of apocalypse stories the kids would get him killedi am now a simp for dokja raised_back_of_handthey only show interest in dokja when they need something from him why should he share his coins with them he made the right call face_with_steam_from_noseyou have me hooked dokja‚Äôs decision really gave a sense of reality to the comic most would make their characters be the ‚Äògood‚Äô guy stick to morals and would give themselves to save others dokja is a very rational character and i am excited to see where his story leads him y did i have the biggest smile on my face when he said y should i give u any am i psychodokja really takes no ones shit and i think that‚Äôs what makes him such an awesome protagonist like yeah it‚Äôs cruel but considering the circumstances he‚Äôs got every right to refuse no one else has done anything that deserves his help it‚Äôs survival of the fittest people are bound to show their ugly sides no matter whatif i was one of the people there i would be desperate and honestly feel some resentment towards dokja but id also understand that he very much risked his life to get the food and coins he has and i dont have the right to demand him to give me some especially if i havent even tried to risk my life to get them myself so i understand if they feel frustrated but it should be more with themselves and the situation what dokjas doing is perfectly fine and realisticabsolutely love this antihero what a fresh twist looking forward to the lack of romance and high action packed chapter to followi love him hes not evil just logical and fairtheyre all using scrap metal bats tools and pipes as weapons with some waving bone weapons as the highest thing there and this mf pulls out a swordhe risked his own life to get the food of course he is not going to give it all out for freei like a lot dokja just because hes not pretend to be like the hero or something like that hes just acting like the situation are and the instinct of survive the woman‚Äôs constellation has to be ariadne right like with the whole thread to get out of the dungeon thing is kinda like her and the labyrinth i mean why should he give them coins when they are threatening him i was wondering how they were going to portray the dokkaebi chat i must say i am thoroughly pleased i love the emoticons face_with_tears_of_joypurple_heartthis webtoon is so amazing the art is some of the best ive ever seen it is so well done i love it the plot is awesome i normally dont like apocalypsethemed stories but this is amazing the characters are fantastic too especially dokja i love how realistic they all are i can tell how hard the authors worked on this and they did truly some of the best work ive ever seen well donedokja me too give me just coins to know what happens next in the story and then give me more and then more and then more then i will pay you back please i just want to see more of your surprising and amazing intellegence and decisions second later rip my arms god i wanna read more why cant this series just be over so i can binge it i love that hes not a hero i get tired of all the high morals and instead hes a survivor this comic is amazing what‚Äôs the old saying about jesus ‚Äúgive a man a fish he will that day teach a man how to fish he will eat every day‚Äù giving them coins doesn‚Äôt solve the issue because what about the next day and day after that they‚Äôll need someone to help them rather help themselves these people complain about morality but dont hesitate to kill people for coins at leat dokjas transparent they all knew about the survival fee yet they still bought so much food that they didn‚Äôt have any left for the fee now correct me if i‚Äôm wrong but didn‚Äôt you get coins for clearing the first situation they had enough coins there alone to survive two days but they bought large quantities of food in order to have it now doesn‚Äôt that sound like the sloth and fox sin gluttony and greed screw them dokja is definitely doing the right thing its funny how those people went from pleading for dokjas help to being completely hostile towards him talk about true colors huhunrelated but i swear to god i am screaming about this little boy gilyeong i love you so damn much i dont know what it is but something about him has just stuck in my heart since the beginning and every reaction with dokja just makes my head spin the big brother vibes are killing mehonestly it‚Äôs messed up that they‚Äôre all so dependent of dokja since he has the food and the coins like damn if yall want some then stop sitting around and get some yourself survival of the fittest and wisest am i right if your kid doesn‚Äôt have enough coins or food stop babying himher and teach them to survive not to depend on othersdude is a true capitalistdokja is such a badassin an apocalypse there could have been no better choiceleshgoo im so glad hes not your typical hero he has his own sense of neutrality nd i love that damn it why is he so hotpeople can hate dokja all they wanti still think hes bae weary_facered_heartÔ∏èraised_handmedium_skin_tonedamndokja is sparklesÔΩÜÔΩâÔΩéÔΩÖ sparklesah yes this is the type of mc i like relieved_facey didn‚Äôt he say that guy with the glasses have coin just ask himface_with_tears_of_joyhes using like a mythical max level weapon on level villagers i love how people were trying to guilt him using morals and then literally two seconds later tried to kill himomniscient reader is the best thing on this universe i completely understand why he chose to do that if he wouldve chosen to give his coins out most of the people would die anyway and he would‚Äôve wasted coins for no reason leaving him with way less coinsits funny how the same people willing to kill to survive are the same ones that ask for coins to survive like get your crazy ideas that world revolves around you under control dokja aint at fault for the fact u domt have survival fee after all u did was sit on your asses and wait for someone else to take care of youi really like where this is headed so many stories have the main character stick to the typical hero plot which there‚Äôs nothing wrong with because it always makes a good story but i really like how different this is it‚Äôs a way more accurate portrayal of the chaos and the human desire to survive people really wouldn‚Äôt be generous in this scenario it really is a fantastic depiction of survival of the fittestthe reason wednesdays exist omniscient readerdokja just became one of my favourite mcsi like this so much i didn‚Äôt think he was going to kill someone but you got to do what you gotta do and it‚Äôs not some game this is actual survival you already payed for the food so no refunds this is a game of survival and you must think wisely i think everyone can agree it‚Äôs so refreshing to have a character who cares about others but also knows to look after themself first can‚Äôt wait to see how it develops further thank you author keep up the great workdokja‚Äôs character is what‚Äôs lacking in solo leveling limits i rly rly like dokjams character the whole series i believe is a gem that needs to be caressed slowly great job author hope it continues to prosper im a caring person but im siding with dokja they dont see that they allowed this situation and are still being manipulatedwhy do i feel like dojka is going to turn into a nuetural good charactercan i just say that sword is real nice dokja sold food for $ while inho sold his food for more why should dokja be responsible for all these people lifes if he isnt even part of the group if inho the leader shouldnt he be responsible for everyone people can lie about how much coins they actually have people already knew about this coin system early so shouldnt they have been responsible with their moneylook our favorite dokkaebi is backü•∞ü•∞ü•∞its not that he doesnt care at all he just knows that he needs those coins to survive later because he knows the relative future it is his life over others so obviously he has to choose himself no one is going to pay him back laterhyeonseong lee is the type of guy that would never cheat on you relieved_faceanother thing i love about this is that his group stays by him they understand that he doesn‚Äôt owe these people anything and he‚Äôs not a bad person for refusing to give them food and money i‚Äôm glad that they aren‚Äôt falling for any of itdokja has made his way to my top favorite badass manhwa characters sitting at # right behind sung jin woothis doesnt make him evil or even neutral as he points out no one here is good and hes resisting the evil manipulation of the incite powerlook ma no handswhy are people trying to get refunds for the food that they already ate lmao im with dokja you foolshow can they ask for a refund after they have already eaten the foodi stan dokja it‚Äôs not on him to save everyone do you boo boohe really just said dont touch me or my family at the last scenedaammnnn this is the character ive been looking fooorrr oh sweetcheese dokja imma go marry youloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_facedokja is smart as hellgosh that kid is quite op oh cool sangah have some useful skill too woah so dokja can now collect information on the target character omg the cute evil dokkaebi bihyeong is back oh so the dokkaebi can use telepathy with dokja thats interesting lol the soldier hyeonsyeong is happy with his shield bruh this annoying guy again yes im waiting for you to make your decision too dokja deym he went full cold psycho thats so awesome he even cut that guys arm off clean im so proud of youit‚Äôs is time ladies and gentlemen this is what i call sweet fucking satisfaction everyone is like oh he doesnt have morals but thats not true his morality is just different in an alignment chart he would be lawful neutral possibly lawful good compared to everyone else he doesnt believe in giving away things for free the people could offer him something and he would probably agree that doesnt make him morallesshonestly dokja‚Äôs character development really resonates with me if i have been put at the edge of my life‚Äôs cliff numerous times hanging on with my teeth i‚Äôd be sick and tired of people‚Äôs shit toooh my‚Äî dokja is so‚Äî jfjdhskfhdjebdjdndj fire fire fire fire yes yes dokja worked so hard for his coins and he is without any sponsor why should he give them just because they think he shouldnt let them die they killed people without problem to survive the first scenario face_with_rolling_eyeswtf he is hero for his friend and villain for others i love it face_screaming_in_fearface_screaming_in_fearface_screaming_in_fear i love this types of character thank god he‚Äôs not like other main characters ü•∫person_raising_hand‚Äçfemale_signÔ∏è dude he‚Äôs so cool t^t is intrigued by dokjas choicesnnoo i read all the episodes this is one of those ones where they should make into a showyo i think dokja made the right decision it‚Äôs an apocalypse and he has his own to care for plus how many of those people would give up their coins if they were in his situation i‚Äôm pretty sure none of them would relieved_faceit‚Äôs literally the apocalypse you live on by every decision you make and being nice isn‚Äôt going to keep you alive forever dokja did the right thing im honestly in love with dokjas characterdokja in the beginning of the webtoonim not smart or handsomedokja right now is the most attractive character everi smell anti hero development and im here for itsmiling_face_with_smiling_eyesdokja has shown us he‚Äôs considerate but he‚Äôs not a pushover either when this is your th time reading the comic and it still hasnt gotten oldwell if he would not have sold them food they would be already dead person_shrugginglight_skin_tone‚Äçmale_signÔ∏èim % with dokja in this why the hell he has to share his coins just because some random dude ask you lmao tbh ill do the same he doesnt have the responsibility for others lifes only for his own survival dokja is one of the best mc ive seen in a while love the line about the killing in the first triallike youre capable of premeditated murder but not to take care of yourself you dont even have to do everything alone you can team up if they didnt just stay in one place roughly % of them would be able to survivehonestly i would have behaved like that too dokja is not selfish just because he isnt being blindly selfless he is strategic because this world is all about survivali love how hes not our typical hero and is a human to be honest if i was in his position i probably wouldnt help them either its a dog eat dog world only the fittest will survive every man for himselfi like how he refuse he earn the coins with hard work and good thinking while those people are desperate to survive but they don‚Äôt think outside of the box like dokia in the first scenariodokja is good and evilyes mess them up do not i repeat do not let this sick ass bastered get away with thisits literally not his fault its like attack a stranger because they didnt want to help you with your problems its your life to deal with dokja is such a refreshing main character i feel like most mains are usually true good or true evil but so far id say hes pretty neutral hes so interesting and unpredictabledick leader hey bro dont you have the most coins everyone communism intensifieshonestly i‚Äôm happy protagonists should focus on their own survival it‚Äôs not realistic to expect someone to sacrifice themselves for a bunch of strangers not to mention ones who have killed innocents to survive forget morality this is spartathanks author how is this comic not popular you need to be appreciated author nice decision he worked hard for those coins those people should‚Äôve worked for coins when they clearly had the chance not leeching of someone else‚Äôs coins it is also not even his fault that they don‚Äôt have coins from not using it wisely so honestly don‚Äôt give me that shit face_with_steam_from_nose fuck i love dokja sm i think dokja is doing the right thing even if the other people think he is being selfish in a survival scenario you cant depend on others to save you the incite guy is banking on dokjas morality forcing him to play nice but survival is the goal not being likedariadne was a princess who gave someone theseus or daedalus i think her magical thread for them to escape a labyrinth im a super greek mythology geek so my theory is sangahs constellation might be ariadne or something its funny how they blame dokja for everything like did he forces you to buy the food or what dokja i‚Äôll give you the coins back if you can undigest all that food you bought from mehe handled that nicelyits funny how similar this is to real capitalism people always seem to demonize people with money because there are needy out there and thus try to take their money through various means just a connection my brain madeoh shi turned him into overhaul rolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingpacifism is a point of weakness in a world where everyone has already killedive never bought any coins or tried to on this app but this story not only made to buy and look for coins but also the only one for which i use all those coins and thats saying something no sorry a lotttbtw i just love dokjas character the right balance of good and evil he knows when to be good and when not to be he doesnt follow common guide lines or general society morals which are dubious at times like thesei read it in the novel but i still get irritated and upset with this scene kim dokja may sound selfish but everyone else needs to be responsible for their own lives giving them fish for today wont help them tomorrow ironically i have ran out of coins so now i have to waitthe constellation the reader of a thousand webtoons gives dokja a bro fist of approvalare you jeanhenri fabre or something bahahahahahaha amazing face_with_tears_of_joyaslal is really interested in every decision dokja make she has become a fan of yours here‚Äôs your five coin bro we all just people spending money to read will we all heard this qoute if you make this a game ill show you how its played thats how exactly how he manage to not keep going to his game plan i love it and im still willing to waste more coinsstrong escanor vibes^¬∞^well at least this webtoon is close to reality in terms of attitudeim done with hypocrite characters so always have those high values that sometimes it doesnt feel real at all i cannot express how much i love protagonists like dojka a person‚Äôs bound to get tired of mary sues at some point pensive_facei love moral grey points in post apocalypse i hate seeing the goody twoshoes in these situations its literally kill or be killed everyone there has taken a life so they dont deserve true sympathyall yall getting heated in the comments coz dokja aint fit your standards of high morality theyre all murderes lmao dokja raised a very good point on ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt even take responsibility for their own lives‚Äù so why would dokja be responsible for their lives‚Ä¶ yes it would be kind and generous of dokja if he‚Äôs willing to give it to them for free but for him this is survival of the fittest and he earned those big money because of his smart thinkingstrategy he has the right to refuse as selfish and cruel as it sounds them trying to leech on him forcibly and badmouthing him when they aren‚Äôt even‚Äî‚Äîbe nice and give these murderers you dont even know some of your life line and risk you and your own groups safety and survival to make these people who just sit in a corner till someone comes whom they can leech off on survive hours then leech off on you again next time cuz youre nice yeah sure no shtpff to be completely honest i wouldve been worse in dokjas situation like i dont know why i should save them i dont mind being called the villain i just protect those people i value and im not about to risk nor sacrifice the chances of our survival to murderers i barely knowi love it when the mc is neither a hero or a villainbro wjy is he so hotim beginning to like this man i think i‚Äôm in love right now i would just mention that this fella right here killed a demon and got coins as reward so one of your men now has enough coins to save everyone sheesshhh mah guy turn to erenok but bihyeong was so cute in that one panel xddhe watched his own hands wave him goodbye waving_handlight_skin_tone face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyrolling_on_the_floor_laughingface_with_tears_of_joyi might sound wicked but i really liked how he reacted smiling_face_with_hornsim still not done reading the novel but dang i love dokjas character so much but once again none of these people tried to hunt monsters and complete the task like bruh theyre just a bunch of leeches and the spirit said that coins will be drawn daily even if they had it for the night they wouldnt have any for the next night and they still wouldnt try to go kill monstersrn my favorite constellation is prisoner of the golden headbandthat moment when u are done playing the good guy routethis is definitely an interesting scenario nice to see bihyeong again toochaotic neutral lol well hes not evil bc all of these people are murderers too lol even worse theyre entitled ones who did it wo thinking in the first taskgrimacing_facedokja is really right i mean they taken someone elses life for their survival and now they arent ready with their life to be taken thats so ridiculous lol dokjas a chaotic neutral typehe is being realistic tho im sick of mc who is always trying to be goody two shoes its an apocalypse who tf in their right mind would want to help others lets be reali think dokja is a complex morally grey character i like those typesam i the only one having a deja vu of kirito from saoits their fault that they dont have coins leeching off of other people and then blaming a guy who worked hard for his coins no thanks face_with_rolling_eyesraised_back_of_handmedium-light_skin_tonetheyre just pretending to have a high morality high morality yet illogical face_with_rolling_eyes buzzing excuses without even thinking justice should be served who cares about morality when it‚Äôs about your survival feels good to see a mc that doesn‚Äôt want to be a hero all the time‚Äúi want a refund‚Äù bruh you‚Äôre saying you want to uneat food you yourself had chosen to survive by tf lmaomorally grey characters are the most interesting imo im interested to see how dokjas personality and choices influence the original storygod mode has been activated that dude deserved it tbh that sword just cut through flesh ligaments veins and fricking bones in just one clean slice thats literally impossible its an upswing toohyeongsong lee is so smiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyesdamnnn dokja is seeming to be more malevolent now even the art is making him look evil wonder if his allies will keep supporting him though they didnt seem like theyd want to share their coins either sangah seems reminiscent of ariadne from the greek myths so im wondering where shell stand tooeven the constellations were speechless flushed_faceholy shit this is so refreshingdokjas principles astonished_faceastonished_faceastonished_face‚óã‚óã that was hotwow i think hes going to be an anti hero i love how he cut off that guys arms with hesitation these peoples hypocrisy is just so real to me if ever this apocalypse happens the audacity to be guilt tripping someone to greed over their lives when that persons already trying to survive himself too you have been gifted coinsi just like how much he fking loves his new shield yes an mc that doesn‚Äôt stick to the morals ‚Äòhelp everyone‚Äô also they know what theyre doing with the cliffhangers lmaoaoaogive me your hard earned coins so i can survive i dont deserve to die did you kill another human being to get here um yes then screw off thumbs_uplight_skin_tonebrohe arms wentyeet skullthese people are the most unreliable if he helped them now then later they would probably betray him when the odds are against him dokja is seriously my number character and development i agree damn well with his choices i would do the same its the apocalypse not a guy begging on the street i dont mean that rudely btwi love this because he just stick to surviving that‚Äôs all sure he may be doing some wrongs but also some right he is more balance if anything i dig dokja hes more in a grey area instead of being a goodytwoshoes a lot of protagonist with his powers and knowledge would use them too much and create more problems for themselves im glad a lot of webtoons seems to promote this kind of less predictable protagonistdokjas face expressions coupled with his black shirt was really hot dokja is against communism dokja isnt a hero nor is he a villain hes a survivor doing whatever it takes to live and give the people he cares about the opportunity to survive without taking care of themyou know what i think he is making the right decision its there fault for being greedyunamused_face love the twist btwgrowing_heartafter reading this comic my eyes are still shining from excitement ü§© think about it those people are getting what they deservedokja is the most fair of all them it may seem a little too drastic but giving that people coins would be like giving thousands of money to murderers bc of the first scenario im so happy there is finally a character that dont care about what the others think that is fair and trust on their own point of viewdokjamy guyi simp for youi just wanted you to knowi definitely love dokja being a real one giving coins to everyone doesn‚Äôt help anybody what a masterpiece of a webtoon weary_facethe last panel was literal fire dokjas squad are preparing to destroy those idiotsthis webtoon is so much like the novel such a loyal recreation so fardokja nah frick you i have excaliburthey paid him fairly for food and get mad that he stole his money he just went and got food like any of them couldvethe constellation webtoon fangirl is very intrigued i‚Äôm curious to see how dokja‚Äôs party thinks of this them ppl thought dokja was pussy face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy the entitlement of all of them as if he had to help them because why to be a good person please they all sat around on their asses instead of trying to fend for themselves and expect him to give out his resources he earned for free byeee aint his fault since he didnt force you guys to buy the foodshit i love this webtoon i think im addicted to iti like dokjas thinking all those people literally killed other people to make it this far but now act like their the victims at the hands of his mercy if they were ready to kill other people for survival they are responsible for their own survival as well its also unlikely for them to survive anyway if they dont stop to rely on other people and they literally had the choice to either try finishing the scenario or die because of lack of coins the first might have even provided some coinshonestly what are they gonna do to him if he doesnt share in a matter of minutes theyll all be dead anyways soi love his character its real who would want to share his live freely with someone he didnt know survival of the fittest bitch you adapt or you die face_screaming_in_fearface_screaming_in_fearface_screaming_in_fear me likey smirking_face and thats how this became my favorite webtooni love that do you have a death wish or something look at the end OK_handdokja doesnt have time for your bs dude here i am the person who read the novel patiently waiting to see kyrgioschaotic neutralwait until you see what he become in the futurewhat i find interesting is that these people who are themselves killers trying to hold dokja to a moral high ground like bishyup inho needs to see he ain‚Äôt the boss and the people need to see that inho has been mooching off of them parents with little kids children women have it rough in scenarios like these but even dokja knows that he needs to cull thieving menaces to be of real help and that dude that got violated by a demon seems to not have learned his lesson either the point is that all the people in this scenario are murders they have killed someone to be in this scenario for them to be asking for coins as if it is the moral thing to do is ridiculous it depends on who actually deserves to be helped sangahs ability reminds me of the legend of theseus and the minotaurim glad the main character is basically saying fck you im tryna survive too aint no charity in these streets this is just life the rich people dont hand out money we work for our coinsi think his point is justifiable he straight up asked why do you deserve his coins prove it get them this is the apocalypse being friends wouldnt help you survive for long relieved_faceto be honest dokja is the type of person who is alone but when it comes to lifethreatening situations he would do anything and help anyone if it benefits him as well the type of people dokja is helping are the type to giveandtake they are all compatible in there small group that dokja made they help each other out on the other hand inho cheon who dont give any fs and use other people i would also like to see inho cheon face when that man hands got cut of by dokjaalso dokja legit is getting food and this is what they do the respect he might point out that the got who killed the monster has coins and that the guy leading them didnt seem worried so he must have plenty of coins to sparedear santa please give me coins so i can read the next chapter i promise ill be good remember people to heart this chapter lets appreciate the characters uniqueness red_heartÔ∏èkillin old ladies one moment and begging for mercy the next naaww bruhs im good ah chaotic good i am familiar them give us our coins back dokja ¬Ø\\_„ÉÑ_¬Ø survival of the fittest ¬Ø\\_„ÉÑ_¬Ødokja is looking out for his newly formed family notice how he was telling his new kid brother not to use his ability until he tells him to or how he lets the girl know not to tell anybody about her contract or how he got a shield for his buddy it seems to me hes looking out not just for himself but his friends oh and love the back and forth with the dokabilmao i just realized something coins are the most powerful thing in that world and this is the same for us people who have enough coins can fastpass while us peasants are left to die in boredom and impatience lewlthe moral high ground has no meaning when the first thing you had to do to survive was take another lifehe just had enough of your shitthank you for the realism when your life‚Äôs at stake there‚Äôs no time for a moral high grounddouble_exclamation_markÔ∏èdouble_exclamation_markÔ∏èhelp me i have a serious thing for dokjai feel like you could never stick to a moral high ground in an apocalyptic universe people are gonna die and you want to survive what you have to do to survive may not he the most morally good thing to do but thats lifei like dokja‚Äôs way of thinking it‚Äôs not the typical ‚Äúhero‚Äù personality that he‚Äôs got but at least he thinks rationally depending on the situation they are in stan dokja place_of_worshipdid they think theyd survive if it werent for dokja giving them the food what do they think is dokja to them their nanny ofc hes gonna ask you to pay for shit nothing is free in this world nothing i really do love dokjas character to death hes not the usual annoyingly good guy mc and even the protagonist of the story isnt nice theyre human and it shows i love how much this webtoon shows the flaws of us living beings i also would do the same thing hes smart cunning and selfish plus he tells it how it is like why should i give up my coins for yall when that has nothing to do with me he reminds me of myself and i love iti think dokja is a good person he does help people when he can like heewon but theres a line between nice and stupidty he cant just sacrifice himself for everyone else in such an insane world it really forces your true self out of you i like how this mc isnt just gonna blindly follow we must help others sharing is caring~ like many other mcs do another example of an mc i think is similar to dokja in the above stated manner is medea from your throne dokja sure is one hell of an interesting character huhi love how realistic kind of dokja is i mean his personalitydokja had to risk his life in many situations in order to earn that many coins it‚Äôs his right to keep those coins to himself instead of giving it to people that sat around in a safe zone waiting for coins and food while others went out and risked their lives for coins and food person_shruggingokay but seriously how many of them killed to survive the first round only thise who didnt deserve it and honestly survival of the fittest and his friends he and his crew went out and earned those coins they didnt kill a single person eitheridk why people think the protag is evil in the first game he saved the child when he had no reason to and he also saved the woman from the poison when yet again he had no reason to it just so happens that they were useful the child was not in the webtoon that he was reading and the woman was but he had no idea who she wasim just waiting for the constellation secretive plotter to reveal that heshe is the author of twsano shits were givenbro what abt the suit guy he has like coinsthe ad i got at the end of this episode just so happened to be a snickers adself defence moral high ground they took lives why should he save theirs i dunno still pretty high morals and he attacked only when his life was in danger person_shrugging‚Äçfemale_signÔ∏è it‚Äôs not all so black and whitedealing with people is exhausting irl and even in apocalypseare we just gonna ignore hyeongseong lee being adorable after polishing his shieldright if you need coins get them for yourself dokja literally fights everytime while the others just wait for food and coins its an apocalypse i dont like it morally but i do agree with him since he did earn the coins and this is life or death he cant rlly be charitable in this kind of situation yep im addicted ddokja was like nah this an apocalypse not a charity fearful_facefearful_facefearful_face dokja sometimes is really scary i want a refund huh lol ok karen i want a refund when you ask for a refund you gotta bring back what you bought no then give the food back oh you cant not his problemdude theres literally a survival fee for everyday say dojka gave away all these coins for the people ok and then what he cant do this everyday so theyre going to die anyway like bruh hes not even being evil i played way too much etrian odyssey to not recognize an ariadne thread when i see one face_with_tears_of_joyooh what a powerful boy we got therei love grey charactersthat army guy is so cute when he wipe that shield smiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_closed_eyessmiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_closed_eyessmiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_closed_eyesskfjfjsjfjj why am i so into the whole morally grey mc trope weary_face especially when they got that iq OK_handü§å like medea muah chefs kissthings have gotten so interesting i misread have you all been well and saw it have you all been in hellluke skywalker would be proud i love me some psychological warfarethis is survival anything goes if only you hadnt bought excessively then none of this wouldve happened he may look like hes making heartless decisions but its simply survivallol our favorite doakabi is backi mean even if he went full on humanitarian and gave away every single scrap he still couldn‚Äôt save everyone in rescue training they teach you never to put yourself in a position of unnecessary risk bc you‚Äôll just increase the number of people needing rescuedsame idea here some degree of selfishness required im satisfied with dokjas decisionmorally grey characters are my weaknesswhy isnt anyone talking about bihyeong he was hilarious and adorable that wink and that totally innocent whistlingso chaotic neutral character niceother readers i love this doods attitude me yay bihyeongs backa character with common sense and isnt an asshole im hooked now dokja is so badass im here for itbruh the kid in the back is lookin just as evil as dokja he like mfer deserved it person_shruggingmedium_skin_tone‚Äçmale_signÔ∏èim kind of happy a little sad that some kids will die but these people cant seem to understand that this world now revolves in a different way and dokja will ride the wavesim glad that dokja didnt give infck that dumb face inho i wannaunamused_faceoncoming_fist himi love how this dude really keeps targeting dokjahe doesnt even help them out himself just using their misfortune to manipulate them no more kind dokjai like how dokja has gone from ‚Äúi am a normal person‚Äù to ‚Äúi am a super genius‚Äù to ‚Äúwhy should i give a shit if you live or die‚Äù over the course of ~ chaptersin a situation where you dont need morals to survive i like that attitudehehhes so hot god i need a minutethe look in his eye is crazy and i love itcheckmate communists yesyesyes yes kill them alli love it when the mc turns evilooo goddamn dokja is becoming a morally grey character someone who isn‚Äôt good but not baddokja is my new religion üßé‚Äçfemale_signÔ∏èhonestly i get it why sacrifice for people who leech off of you and kill you the first chance they get the best thing to do while they still had plenty time wouldve been to try to fulfil the scenario with the strongest leading the charge or with inho inspiring the others but unfortunately those in charge are selfish cowards im glad he chooses to be selfish cause for what reason he wanna give them the coins in this time you should save yourself first before save other people yay the little crazy creature is bk and l love dokia face is like a crazy person laughing to himselfthis webtoon is awesome the main character is very progressive and hyper aware of the situation i love it hey uh dokja got cake all these people survived by murdering someone if anything they shouldn‚Äôt even talk about sharing and having morals i think dokja‚Äôs decisions are right i think morally he is doing the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing to survive what about what‚Äôs his face that received coins for finishing off the demon couldn‚Äôt he sharei love how dokja thinks fck morals be smart this is why i love antihero main characters am i the only one who laughed when the guy looked back at his falling armseyes it was funny to me im not sadistic tho lolif this was real life than id probably have to think about my personal morals and the situation a bit before siding with dokja but since this is fiction im satisfied as hell with whats happening right now go dokja dugh man i read it to fast now i have to waitsmiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_cold_sweatcrying_faceooh yes i love dokja hes one of the best characters ive seen in webtoon so fareveryones gonna forget that coins that evil rich dude got for slaying the monsterwould have been funny if he said that the annoying ex workmate had just won coins just wondering what would have happened then p holy fudge this is the mc that ive been looking forthis has nothing to do with the webtoon but long live the demon kinghe‚Äôs not rude he‚Äôs just being smart all these ppl would never give him if they hadperiod they would never and we all know that so ya why would he dokja is the one character whos neither too kind and good to be true neither evil and ruthless hes smart and wise its so refreshing to see such a character and well ofc hes climbing up the d best list too quicklyomg make this an animeawooga bark bark grryesss love a good chaotic neutral character i wonder what the backstory of that kid did since the first scenario is to kill an organism i wonder if he killed a person or something else the kid as in one of the woman‚Äôs kidi love it when my main characters go chaotic neutraldid anyone notice huwons traits is about to blossom hope she doesn‚Äôt become a mass murder like dokja said she mightplease make this an animei like how the authors made clear dokja its not a piece of cake by making him cut both arms of the thug at once no joking aroundi love this i cant even writehe went from zero to badass in secondsill call it as a realistic smart and pratical good character dokja is the epitome of true neutral im really curious to see how his friends are going to react for him doing that in a survival speaking it was a really good choice if your point in that time is to survive then morals and feelings are useless however in a human way of seeing this situation no matter what you tell yourself there is this feeling of morality that tells you what he did was wrong to those persons who are just trying to live and you shouldnt be with him so it becomes a huge psychological conflictdokjas perfect retaliation this is why its one of the top webtoonsthey all asked so nicely for the coins and food before but when hes finally being a little selfish because there his coins they all just try to kill him like dude he gave away all of his food and risked his life to find more and this is what they resort to loloriginal sin i think it refers to the deadly sin pride inho the b@st@rd lust the guys that tryna rape girls by luring them back in the early ep greed them hovering over dokjas food and money sloth them be just sittin there waiting for food wrath inho and the people attacking dokja envy cursed dude envying dokja for its achievements gluttony idkyeah this decision seems logical to me person_shruggingmedium_skin_tone‚Äçfemale_signÔ∏ènew world new rules even on normal world there is no good people and evil people there is survival your mind own sense od justicethis webtoon is a war between my ‚Äúwork together to survive‚Äù mentality vs my ‚Äúgive no shits cause they don‚Äôt deserve it‚Äù mentality it‚Äôs getting so fucking goodour coins what i find funny is how they all say they want a refund but they already ate all the fooddokja really said f in the chat to the people who cant pay for it eyemoutheyei want dojak to turn the tables besides none of this fee stuff would have happened if greedie boy over there didnt stockpile foodlove when main characters go semi dark in these situationsi really shouldn‚Äôt be laughing this hard face_with_tears_of_joy dokja really is the definition of true neutraldojka in the last panel left me with shivers down my spinei would have turned it around i would have said okay but only if you and your group redistribute your own coins first lets see your status screen and the other search party members and have you pay off as much as possible then i can pay the remainder that should be fair since i havent officially joined this group yet and have been attacked twice already dont delay too long of you want everyone to surviveim eagerly waiting for the next episode dokja is not a hero known for his heart of gold and his bravery hes just another player with a distinct advantage he has intricate knowledge of the game world and he has to use that knowledge wisely im sure he doesnt want people to die but theres no point in killing himself for them so early in the game he might give them a chance if he deems them worthy of joining his party but thats about it dokja is so freaking cool because he is not one of those goodygoody always do whats right and angelic and kind at your own expense kind of character but he is not just a straight up kill everyone and make explosions for no reason but to cause suffering kind of character either it is so amazing and i love itit was the people decision to buy the food in the first place then they crazy cause they don‚Äôt have the coins to survive anymore tough luck man person_shrugging‚Äçmale_signÔ∏èi think dokja is chaotic neutralhe did the right decision i would of done the same or just not returnyou see those mental gymnastics right there first they blame dokja for all their problems then they expect him to fix their problems and then expect him to just sit their and let them jump him hilarious hahaha the fine line between morality vs justice it may not be morally right to not help those people but they put themselves in that position so it would be unjust to dokja if he were to selflessly sacrifice what he had earned himself it‚Äôs all oh so sweet gotta love dokja my man clapping_handsmedium-light_skin_toneclapping_handsmedium-light_skin_toneclapping_handsmedium-light_skin_toneit isnt morality its justice what have they done to deserve the coins its just stupid the next time they need to pay the fee they wont have any coins because there aren t helping nor going out for supplies btw black shorted hair girl is waifu uwui was getting tired of him playing along for the love of god its the fcking apocalypsei really like this character development unlike other main characters this make apocalypses more realistic i hope dokja knock some sense into those people against inho or even themselves they let themselves get into a position where inhos group has power over them it may not be the best decision for dokja but it may have been a wise oneyes finally an mc in dealing with these kind of scenarios the way i want them too no more playing the hero and saving people who dont need to be saved or will just flip on you at the drop of a dime my god the adrenaline kick from this episode love it anyway i really hope this gang stays as allies relieved_facerelieved_facehm so dokja is a gray characteri clapping_handsmedium_skin_tone dont clapping_handsmedium_skin_tonehave clapping_handsmedium_skin_tonemoney clapping_handsmedium_skin_tone so clapping_handsmedium_skin_tone ill clapping_handsmedium_skin_tone wait clapping_handsmedium_skin_tone lmao loudly_crying_face this webtoon is a dopethose peopleare so stupid really he worked hard for it and its not his fault that they didnt get to eat bc it got confiscated and also they didnt huntthey cant just stick or think someone will do things for them to survivethen they have the audacity to ask for coins when all they do is complain best mc everof course those people deserve coins but if they‚Äôre all clamoring and running up towards him violently he can‚Äôt give them to anyone since he doesn‚Äôt even have enough coins in addition they are only thinking of themselves when doing this trying to attack him saying that he needs to give them coins because they need them more than him because it‚Äôs evil to do otherwise they act out of selfishness so why can‚Äôt dokja act out of selfishness too this is the apocalypse i badly want an animation of this webtoon i know it will and i cant for itsneezing_facesneezing_facedokja is right all of these people killed someone else to clear the first scenario now why they are asking him for help thats not how you survive fellas you go dokja as long as he is not betraying anyone he is finebihyeong in the background looking adorable and secretly chatting with dokja is precious best thing ever bihyeong is my fave even though hes a cosmic being that basically runs a torture channel ruining lives and hes not actually like a good guy i guess but whatevs he fictional and sometimes lovelyi think he just wants to see who attacks him and help out the restthe satisfaction when undeserving people dont get what they want flushed_facepersonal attribute of a badassits nice to have a main character who thinks rationally and makes the right decision i love reading his thoughts because they analyze the situations clearly if they cant take care of their own lives what right did they have to take others anyways even if he gave them coins today they will ask for more tomorrowthis is basically equity vs equality should we all receive the same or should we all achieve the same levelyes thats exactly what i wanted to see this webtoon just climbed up the ranks of my top with a gigantic leapeveryone who is saying dokja is gonna be a bad character kind of person i will say these are his survival tactics if he just agrees to everything other people say then whats the profit in reading twsa he needs to be one of the protagonist that i feelit feels to me like dokja is going to walk a weird sort of moral grey area and apply pressure on both sides to survive i like thisok but suit man has like k coins someone let them knowwhy does he let blond main group leader live he kills for lessthis is totally interesting survival story where moral ground is in conflict with survival of the charactersfinally tbh i would of been done killed someone bro like fr idc let me be the villain that is full and is rich off coins i earned my fair share should of read the book sucks to suck tell on the so called leader that bastardit would have been seriously idiotic if dokja had chosen otherwise usually all the protagonists try to be heroic and hold on to their morals and stuff with the stupid self sacrificing personality but dokja is straightforward legendary and his face in that panel why should i give you any was so badass it‚Äôs nice to have heroes that act selfish once in a while it‚Äôs quite refreshing to see the people‚Äôs faces like ‚Äúwhat but we wasted our money on your food refund‚Äù i‚Äôm like ‚Äúbruh if you can‚Äôt return the food in one edible piece why should he give back the coins‚Äùyou dont care about him so why would he care about you unamused_faceohohohohohoits not censoreddokja keeps showing traits of maybe why his destiny chose him to hold more power in the times of apocalypse people deserve love mercy and sharing to prosper together but dokja also knows how to find the true deserving ones when you go to attack someone you should expect them to fight back he has more coins than all of you for a reasonnow this is what a protagonist should bewell frick why does dokja have to be so hot and cool help me pls somebodyyou don‚Äôt need to set yourself on fire to keep other people warm greedy people just take and take there‚Äôs no end to it one day it‚Äôs this another it‚Äôs that i‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs not giving in it‚Äôs rare to see a main character not maintain morals this series is so original and well written and honestly i hope it gets its own animeme who needs coins to feed the next episodewhen u try to roleplay a true neutral pc on dungeons and dragonsfinally a main character who isn‚Äôt always niceoh i like him more and more why should dokja share his coins if they didnt even earn them everyone literally wants everything for free and its patheticyess a protagonist makes a practical decision he looks dead on the insidehe literally disarmed that guythis was a ratherdisarming episodethread and labyrinth huh i think her sponsor is a greek mythdokja yesss you will not be fooled by that evil manokay but why is the dokkaebi so cutethis webtoon is so amazing i do not regret fast passing lee hyeonseong lee hyunsung whatever spelling your name is lmao you precious bean i wanna protect you with my life i wanna wrap you in a blanket and sing you lullabies this webtoon always makes me coins spendin and im not regretting it aahhh this nigga rawdokja gives a lesson stand up for urself u always gonna be kind to everyone then u gonna get urself killed limit ur kindness ^_^the fact that i have to wait is killing me but this is now my new favorite series fast pass isnt fast enough if you reached the last available episode neutral_facei like how dokja is a true neutral character not a protagonist but also not a villain he doesn‚Äôt hurt or help anybody he doesn‚Äôt have to with exceptions lol and i am excited to see where his character development goes from here finally i feel bad for the guy who got his arm cut off but damn that is one effective way to settle a crowd and get them to listen real quick even if only for a minute it could make all the difference is this man just going to straight up murder the leader damn i hope sovote dokja for most savage man of not even someone just spare me more coins i promise ill pay you back just more to make it to the next scenariowelp now i‚Äôm officially going bankrupt thank you webtoonssharin ain‚Äôt carin in face_with_medical_maskexcited to see a well written anti hero these are so hard to cone by these daysi see dokja being a grey area character not necessarily evil but not good either hes just true neutral people kill the man who survived the subway dokja deletes a mans arms please do continue to try if you want to diethat‚Äôs insane he‚Äôs giving out coins in trade for handsi love dokjathis is not a handy situation its all out of hand and in the palm of chaos but this story is finger licking goodcame to comment on how much i like having a neutral main character but so did everyone else face_with_tears_of_joyoh boy he‚Äôs not playing around anymorewhy cant they release two chapters a day they got me fcked up having to wait eyespouting_facepouting_face also i love homegirl that asked for the sword lol bish has no chill and i love it she is def gun be a bad ass character raised_fistmedium_skin_toneoncoming_fistmedium_skin_toneanger_symbolthatll be me when i stop acting nice to everyone and smilingdokja is right why would he give his coins for them if he gave his coins they will just be thankful at first but the system will collect coins and the cycle will repeat again its % waste he dont even know or owe them theyre parasites and you wouldnt want parasites stick on you and extract all you have until you have nonei‚Äôm not gonna put dokja on a pedestal for cutting the guy‚Äôs forearms off but i will say this is getting pretty interesting slayyy dokja as you shouldhe always think logically i love his characterim so addicted to this webtoonwhat high morality and shit dokja collected all those coins himself he risked his life to get the foods too if anything its those leechesthat went from please give us some of your coins~ to kill him and get his coins from him real quickdokja is just keeping it if they wanted to live they couldve gone out and put the work in instead following a prick who just talks all the damn time dokja earned his coins he owes nothingwhy do they want a refund i mean they bought it and ate itskulli mean think about it what would happen in the long run its just like that saying you can give a man a fish but you can teach how to fish and hell fish for the rest of his life its not exactly like that but in the future they wont have enough coins either and he cant just keep giving them coins that will get him killedyk i love it when characters drop the good deeds and decide that they dont wanna deal with any of the bs hes also got a point as well and yeah majority of the people were asses anyway who killed to survive in the first scenario but now theyre all going up to dokja and beg him for coins and shit im excited to see where this is going and him slicing the dudes arms man ive never been so satisfiedreally love dokja so much sick and tired of mcs who are like ‚Äúohhh yeah i‚Äôm a good guy lets share some shit‚Äù he is like nah bitches not happening lmaodokja believes in justice so hes right to ask why if u have bad intentions why should he helphes so hotthis is why i love dokja rolling_on_the_floor_laughingred_heartÔ∏èif its not just me but why do i feel like dokja is not normal either‚Ä¶ from the start where he instantly knew how to use his bookmark and hi calm demeanor while facing people deaths its not normal it feels like he knows something but i couldn‚Äôt explainoh yey ~ theres a difference to logic and morality thats why philosophers always grind their brains with ethics coz they have different values and principles with survival as the main objective being charitable kills even the recipients not just the giverbihyung is back lol but he looks so cuteeven im scared and pleased to his decision its just so good that the author makes the plot twist excitingdokjas decision was realistic idk the right term for that bcs i mean they are all fighting for survival being righteous and kind would actually bring them nowhere or something like that dang i should work on my vocabularyomg im so in love with his attitudethat last panel chillsmc so bad assthis is refreshinghyeongseong is a big softiehahah i like how his arms got chopped off they are saying that he is a bad guy but all of the survivors are bad people for what they have done so they shouldnt even say a person is bad because their is no good peopledokja lookin hot there wtfam i the only one who missed the dokkaebi and thinks its cuteno just me okayexpressionless_faceok damn that was hothes kinda like a prantagonisti would have just murdered anyone who tried to take the coins no moral high ground in this universe screw you inhothey want to get coins easier than accomplishing the scenariosthe best way to describe dokja is dark heror thought their methods are cruel they always do whats justicethis is exactly what i expected him to do in the previous episode people should learn not to blame others for their errors eren likethis is actually a depiction of the sad reality people will blame you for their own misfortune they will ask you things and if you wont give it to them they will blame you for the things they couldnt attain bc of the loss of that something when in fact they couldve made a way to get that something dokja is so hot grrokay look if he gave them coins just for free like he‚Äôs not getting anything in return free he‚Äôs giving them a free pass they will end up just sitting there with their hands outreached waiting for you to put the next thing in their palm they have to earn it even now you have to work for everything so like they‚Äôre not just gonna be given a free pass even the child was like ‚Äúim not gonna be useless‚Äù and got skills to help and actually helped that‚Äôs not a lack of morals or empathy disarming a grunt with ] has taken and is impressed with the hard decision] i wonder if he could have gained any traction by mentioning the incite ability people hate being manipulated once they know then again that would probably be showing his hand too muchantiheroduhyeah like they killed another person to save themselves and now they want him to save them without any profitwhy should hesmirking_facewhat about the dude with over coins did he diemama got a point though it‚Äôs not his fault you‚Äôre there thinking_faceokay but why did he seemed so hot like i can‚Äôt handle one more fictional crushthings are about to get interesting uhonestly they don‚Äôt have any right to make others stick to morality if they themselves have thrown theirs away also that inciteful fellow is annoying too and i‚Äôm excited to see the tables turndamn i just started reading this for just coins but its so addicting lolhe is starting to get the dripi just want someone to look at me like the tank is looking at his shield maybe its just me trying to justify it but i think when he said something to the effect of they all took a life but couldnt take responsibility for their own he knew most of these people didnt even look for an alternative theyre people who wouldnt help him were their positions reversed not after consideration consciously just out of pure cowardice the way people make excuses not to help others every day when theyre easily in a position todokkaebi communication you mean when you and your friend are in the same room texting each otherre reading this was worth it ahh my cute bihyeong is backkkloudly_crying_faceheart_suitÔ∏èto be fair he never has stuck to a moral high ground not in the slightest he has been doing everything as if he wasn‚Äôt actually in the situation himself he is doing everything in order to make the constellations want to pay attention to him fulfilling his end of his contractcame here to get free coins and got a nice webtoon to read winwin situation at its bestglowing_starthis hole coin situation is kinda funny when i realize im reading this for free coins in the app these idiots they were the ones who were going to steal food from dokja and now their mad because he gave it to themdude dokja tho firefirefirefire get em for some reason my brain sometimes automatically reads dokja as doja cat thank u he same situation happened to me obviously not as dangerous but still i was playing and online game and i traded stuff for a rare item and the next day the girl wanted it back i was like no it was a fair trade if u wanted to keep ur items then dont trade theminteresting a john henry fabre reference i highly recommend his book on entomological science the insect world its such a fun book face_with_stuck-out_tongue_&_closed_eyesaye why is that mf mr han siding with the other guy after all that hardship dokja went through to save him unamused_facedamn hes so badass weary_facegive me some dokkaebi plushie pleasegilyeong lools like the child of dojka and the brown haired woman that has the same colored has as gilyeong sorry if im

damm much ughthat last pannel scares the hell outta medokja is about to be the ultimate grey area lolllfkki like this side mci think dokja is doing the right thing if you want to survive an apocalypse you don‚Äôt really try to protect everyone around you this isn‚Äôt a game it‚Äôs life survival of the fittest my dudesfrankly when trying to survive you can only look after yourself and your loved ones in good times or bad you can share what you can but if i had myself to look after i would be the same and im a really giving person you gotta be smart and dokja isso glad the mc isn‚Äôt a generic trash that tries to have a moral high groundi fucking love dokja hes one of the best mc out there he sees no need in having a high moral ground its a damn apocalypsei literally love this character its ok to be badsmiling_face_with_hornsi like how both dokja and the station ppl are to blame for their situation right now the reason theyve run out of coins is bc they gave it to dokja and now everyone is pointing fingers at him its a kindness of dokja to even think of sharing his food to them this webtoon is just amazing cant wait to read more‡≤†–¥‡≤†Ôªøyeeaahh lets goi meani would‚Äôve done the

may addwhy didnt the mc just say that the glasses guy has more coins than him like glasses guy literally has kyes pop off on em dokjadojka is a good character its the others who are bad and i see alot of people saying dojka is being bad and its cool yes hes not helping others whore not even trying he did help them earlier by giving them food for a cost money is a convenient tool for people and theyve just relied on it anyways like he said the first scenario was themed on original sin so it makes sense for everyone else to be sinfulsome people here really makes me wanna slap my phonevery interesting strokes nonexistent beardi think were entering the corruption arc thinking_facei love the mc so much holy shti‚Äôm glad he isn‚Äôt sticking to the moral high ground because i‚Äôm sure that guy that‚Äôs using incite would just use dokja until he was completely worn down it‚Äôs probably why the other protagonist left the subway immediately as well if he gives k coins today then he‚Äôd have to give money again tomorrow and the next day because this group is just sitting arounddamn mc badass level skyrocketed from to a freaking but thats kinda cruel honestly i dont know what id do in

factsperson_facepalminglight_skin_tone‚Äçfemale_signÔ∏èperson_facepalminglight_skin_tone‚Äçfemale_signÔ∏èperson_facepalminglight_skin_tone‚Äçfemale_signÔ∏èwho else hopes this will be adapted into an anime in the near futureim crying from pure fucking happiness i cant belive how good this is bringing back memories from when i read the novell t^tguys remember to like the chapterim laughing cause the regular main characters be like we need to uphold the moral standpoint and share while dokja just be like pay up btches~ i dont fcking care if you die only me and my friends can survive for almost free~ like oh my god~ xd he is like an anti hero or like one of those people you think are more logical than moralsome villains but are actually the main characteraka drstone you have been gifted coins aa hes so hoti am really really happy for dokja he turned it out amazingly i am waiting for the next episodesmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyesfck yesdokja woke up and chose violence and i love itbro that sword is so coolthis is is just too good ive spent my night reading thisloudly_crying_facedon‚Äôt these people know it was their choice to buy food from him you can‚Äôt get your money back with out giving the product back dummiesgoo dokja he doesnt owe them anything when they treated him so badly dokja kinda looking like a psycho at the end there and i kinda i like itthe secret is that the coins they use is the coins us readers use to buy fast passeswinking_facedammnn dokja you rulei agree with dokjas logic why should someone that killed someone else to save themselves get coins from him for free what makes them so deserving of the coins also the food he had hed gathered for himself and was even willing to sell it to them they were not obligated to buy it nor was it his fault when it disappearedhonestly i would do the same in this situation being pushed around by the incite ability can only go as far as you let itdokja just killed a strong monsterwhat are these puny humans gonna do to him lol gtfohes simply just thinking about his own future theres nothing wrong with that people already do it in this world but are more corrupt about it damn manz tryna live dudei thought he would tell them that the glasses clown has coins but this might be better since even if all of these people manage to get past this round theyre guaranteed to die on the next round anyways lolfinally a character not scared of anything take their arms off kingwhy should you share you grabbing other people shit without asking to borrow it this guy is a smart dudeyou know what this is kim dokja the best mc ever and for novel readers did dokja acted like this in the novel i dont remember clearly but i think he was not that angry i really really want this to get turned into an animei got where hes coming from if he gives those ppl the coins thats equivalent to giving all the clothes off your back in the dead of winter and you die and they still in trouble it benefits for a sec but it didnt truly help i kind of like the route his character is taking a lawfully good character would have been supremely irritating because they would continuously sacrifice themselves without thinking of the personal repercussions just like an avg person hes neutral preservingoh my god im loving this so so much and its getting better every single episodemental note dont ask dokja for anything or i might lose my handshe risked his life to get those coins and what did y‚Äôall do just sit around in the station expecting someone else to do the work for youdokja has hit his point i like this character so awesome i like itthese comments literally sound like constellation commentary lol but dokja really is an interesting character because he has a lot to deal with pleasing the constellations trying to stay alive while also helping others it‚Äôs really unfair because he has worked really hard for his coins while other people do nothing and just expect the coins to be handed to them gosh this whole comic is amazing sparkleskingsparkles periodtwell that was hot nosebleeds you see nothingif dokja decide to side with that high moral to help those people he will defintely get trapped in cheon inho plan just like if you being kind to the people for one time they will ask you another kindness thats how human do even in the our world and inho want that for his own selfishness and so he can using and controling dokja thats why what dokja do here is right that last panel tho OK_handlight_skin_toneyaaass im so satisfied with his decision not everyone deserves your own kindness just gotta show em what u r truly capable of which enough to dread others and back offlegit wanna hear dokjas voice and the action asfkjfdlflushed_face if this turn out to be an anime speak-no-evil_monkey theres no word can express my mind see this is why i couldn‚Äôt survive in an apocalypse i‚Äôm too nice the lawful neutral best clift hanger everthis is definitely going to be an anime the way this story is progressing and the twist and turns they‚Äôve made so far and it‚Äôs only been chapters yes yes yes i love this scene what comes after is so great honestly so satisfyingbiyungs reactions on the indirect messages is so kawaii he is a antiheromy man went from midoriya to kirito real quick really thinking about buying the fast pass now this is hype afi think i would make the same decision considering the coinsi would ask and i would make decisionsya know what would be really awesome if dokja just killed the leader and took his coins im really liking this series thanks for your hard workdokja has impressed me by showing how smart and calm he iswhat those fools should of known is that everyone has a breaking point and his just got destroyedim glad that dokja isnt gonna put up with this pricks bull anymore it makes me happy to see hes not in a gaming moodremembers how people usually ask for scope the day before an exam and the aducity to ask for stationery the hour before exam me why should ibest character eversparklesthe apocalypse blame gamefinally the snowball plushy mini demon is back not that other bratthe constellation is very impressed with your performance she decides to gift you she also says thank you for replinishing her sanitydokjas squad shouldnt return back to the camp they can just survive on their owndaaanggg someone cover the kid‚Äôs ears this is about it get even uglierafter reading the webnovel i can‚Äôt begin to tell you how happy i am with this seeing it in picture is one thing now we just need a studio to bring it to lifedokja be likei dont give a fucki love how he doesn‚Äôt care if i were him i‚Äôd do the same cause why should you care when these ppl are all selfish bustardsdamn how i hate these people in storys who only blame others like that wont help or solve the problem mc has no friggin bussines giving them free coins and then die himself like bruhi did think he would pull out his sword but i did not expect him to cut off the dudes hands jsjsjjsjsjsi feel like the mc is going to become more of an anti hero you know kinda like deadpool but a little more sanedoes anyone know how their names are pronounced especially gilyeongme being a huge fan of rpg‚Äôs i‚Äôm really interested to see how our little group of characters changes not only emotionally but their skills and items tooi % agree with my mans over here billion iqhmm i‚Äôd say he‚Äôs a lawful neutral still does good things and follows the law but like he‚Äôs really only in it for himself and maybe a few others if he cares about them enough although that‚Äôs probably not that likelyok but dokja that was kinda hot ngl see-no-evil_monkeywhat about the business man he got like million or thousand coins from the curse thing didn‚Äôt hei love dokja even morebadassi was so interested in this webtoon that after reading the last episode i went ahead and read the webnovel lolwhy the hell he needs to share this is apocalypse he gained his coins slaughtering demons he doesnt need to share it with some man only sitting in the corner safely i would do the same with one exception i would spare kids pov you dont remember the actual main characters name they may think he was acting villain but no hes just being logical and i like itdont worry bro you can open your character status in like chapters i‚Äôm so glad dokja didn‚Äôt do what other people would deem the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing those people are hypocrites especially that whatshisface he should die firsthuh come on even the lil kid is using his survival skills its high time these people understand dokja way to go boy man i really dislike inho cheon i think dokja is doing the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing we‚Äôll see exactly what he plans next chapter he didn‚Äôt take those coins from anyone they willingly paid because they wanted the food he originally collected himself and he brings up a good point that all these people who are alive now most likely killed someone in the first scenario to survive i can‚Äôt wait to see how the characters develop especially huiwon also can‚Äôt wait to see what fate belongs to inhowho would give out coins to help killers survive like who the hell they think they area lot of top comments are saying everyone there had to kill in the first scenario but like there are clearly young children & older people present maybe they got lucky and had a different scenario bc i dont remember dokja or dokkaebbi saying the first quest was the same for all users but also even if it was the same maybe some of them had similar solutions to dokja in that scenario and the comments are saying its pragmatic to let all those people die i disagree thats eugenics i need coins too face_with_stuck-out_tongue_&_winking_eye to read any furtherlolall this time i thought the dokaebbi eyes were just hollow sockets when in reality he‚Äôs got these cutesy bubble eyes loudly_crying_facedamn he really said bye bye to that guys arms i like how different dojka thinks im quite interested to see what he does next i cant deny it that guy was good at manipulating people at the right time he knows when to use his powerful enchanting words that was a nice battoujutsu i like this episodeomg i think i have a crushdokja hello my name is dokja and im chaotic neutral nice to meet youdokja thats dark i like it hehehethe color of his words are as ice cold as he is ryt now lolread the web novel guys it is srsly amazing and you will not regret it i couldnt wait for more of the webtoon so i started the novel and i have been reading it non stop for the past three days coz its so good i keep trying to recommend it but it feels just like when dokja tried to recommend twsa and no one listened to him yk this is a very interesting turn of events eyesaand now we have a psychopath as the thumbnail for a week being kind is good but being a pushover isnt all those ppl would die anyway because they are bad players so dojka would only kill himself for nothing he made the correct decision when the world gets bad enough the good go crazy but the smart they go bad he just stated clearly no to socialism just dokja being dokja at this moment they should know they fcked upthey do realize they are trying to say they deserve coins and then attempt to murder their only chance at survival plus they dont even know killing him will give them back their coinsi need coins too yasss dokja slayss sparklessparklesthat villain is dangerous and cunning he turns everything against you including your actions and wordsgenius kill someone then take your coins back by having to touch fingers where the person transferring coins has to think absolutely brillianti would rather be a villain who does good sometimes than be a heroyass i had to same he very logical character and puts himself first mf went sicko mode skullim not even halfway through this webtoon but i just know this is going to be one of my favouritesif u want your coins back give the food back or did u eat it alreadyconstellation broke reader is satisfied with the amount of head rubs dokja is giving gilyeongcrissy wake up i dont like this grinning_faceright decision dude dokja is not your typical saviour protagonist lolall i could say is slaydokja i love you very much dasurrrvv ahabshsjjdhssudokjas character sparklesü§ålight_skin_tonehe kind of look like sung jin wooi‚Äôm liking dokja he‚Äôs being smart and realistic in this situation yess i like the kind but logical mc hes kind but hes a human he must be kind to himself and the people he care first before random people who just want to leech red_hearthes right he risked his life for those coins and he better not give them to people who just sat there and complained as said before age or gender doesnt matter here u can just upgrade ur stats instead of complaining abt not wanting to diedokja is karma incarnate you reap what you sowthat was a wise decision dokja clapping_handsi am very sick because of the development of the dokja character upside-down_face it making the situation more interesting day by day cowboy_hat_facehe‚Äôs being realistic i mean these people are murderers and can‚Äôt even pay for the sin the committed dokja went out of his way and earned these coins so why should he give them he would just make lose and what would these people give him backin return nothing he‚Äôs not all goodie it‚Äôs an apocalypse a fucking apocalypse crazy people skull he wants to survive everyone wants to survive you should be held responsible for you own live they are all moral incorrect inc dokja protag who doesnt care about moral high ground woof woof woof person_bowing‚Äçmale_signÔ∏èperson_bowing‚Äçmale_signÔ∏èperson_bowing‚Äçmale_signÔ∏èothers give me back my coins dokja suck my ass the absolute irony of making the beginning villain a literal edgelord just to pull the same garbage with your main charactereven if he did give them coins they would be monkeys and stay in the station and die the next day anyway _ bruhanyone sharing is caring dokja i dont get paid enough to carethats right show them what kind of people would be like in the future aggressiveness and despirationthese people have the audacity to think that they can kill someone and then beg for their lives like btw has anyone realised that there is another little kid there with his mum r u telling me he killed somebody too dangi would of done the same and i would say that if you arent going to risk it for the biscuit then you are unreliablei love how the kid is just holding his skull weapon so calmly while watching a mans arma get cut offskullwait‚Ä¶ i just realized that people would have automatically completed the first round as the body regenerates cells and others die off constantly and a cell is a living organisim rightif these people want to survive so much then they should probably go and do something instead of expecting to leech off of people who go out and earn their survival like dokja doesyes lets go dokjaa i really love his character its a breath of fresh air im so happy dokya isnt the stereotypical goodtwoshoes im so tired of seeing main characters doing things out of guilt and morals especially if theyre not obligated toi mean you want coins but do nothing to help its a tought world you live in you gotta earn the right to livedeath note vibes right nowi love dokja glad hes not a dumb mc actually love his villain side loldokja joey doesnt share food hes a villain a smart one that protects his comradessoo coolllbut not rlly i woulda done smth to return fire on that other evil guyoh and welcome back bihyeong fluffineeesshiit that was so sexy damnthis unlike him~ but this is going to be exciting dokja youre so coolbihyeong~ i miss you ~~yes dokja slice themlove this don‚Äôt give in to the majority complainers who did this to themselveschaddokja slayyoh you want your coins back revive every single person you killed in the first scenario and give me back every bit of perfect food i sold to you ^^i dont think hes decision is not really evil if think of it those people are the one who blame him from the start so in short those type of people are just face they only agree with you if they get alot of benefits from it without doing something think about it he work so hard to reach that point while those people are just chilling there waiting for miracle to happen doing nothing and blame other for their own misery oh my goddd i got goosebumps dokja my king hello he is so cool weary_faceweary_faceweary_faceweary_faceweary_faceweary_facei‚Äôm freakin so enjoying this twist of personality ughhh i hate constantly seeing unrealistically good morales people bruh in this kinda situation u gotta do everything to survive it‚Äôs a two way street if ur gonna help someone hes so coolok not gonna loe they coulda put a finer face on that last panneldokja casually showing off his absolute dumptruck as he slices that man‚Äôs arm offwhy does the last slides remind me of ninang bryan from tiktokface_with_tears_of_joywait i just want to make sure that her god person thingy is theseus or theaus i forgot but i remember playing a game and it was labrynthy and it said something about the string the thsues guy used to navigate the doungeoun but im pretty sure were thinking thinking_face rightactually i agree with him i would probably be the villain so to say if i was to a survival world like this also hes not completly selfish he did share things with his companions and gave them a very good discount too all in all hes just trying to survive and the people in there all have killed someone to survive while he hasnt so in the end the way he does things to me is pretty justifiedomfg finally a character who doesnt have hero saving syndrome hero saving syndrome is something i created it basically means the mc tries to save everyone even when its clearly dangerousyes use the dagger i wanna see what it does smiling_face_with_hornssmiling_face_with_hornsif i had to guess dokjas moral alignment if guess that hes either chaotic neutral or neutral evilfinally but i do hope atleast the children can be savedomg dokjas new sword why is bihyeong so cute i want to hug him so badif i was in dokjas position i would have given them help immediately but probably would regret it later on because people are fickle minded they can demand for your help and forget what you did for them and turn on you later on he became that nerd into badass real quickhe actually did the right thing its good he said no coins arent cheap they should of worked hard to earn some they had all day lazy people wanting handoutshes just like meevery bitch in this platform other then dokja group survived by killing someone and now they are begging for there lifeohh schnapp eyeseyeseyesgoatjany goati love himthats what i would have done if i was himbro this guy so badass it‚Äôs hotloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_face no homoifw dokja being such a dynamic mcdokja omg ily hes so fineget disarmed squatsman this is awesome i love a good antiherojesus loves you finally yes my insides are melting this is a top tier protagonist right here not like some cliche saint wannabe masochistic protagonist like in every other web novelmangahes so handsome constellation dark flame phoenix smiles at dokjas sudden change in personality and cruel wayshe made a good move literally half of the people there were bad people anyways they deserved itthe way dojka cut the persons arm was the coolest thing ever i have seen all weekshit escalated realquickhell yeahhh texting with the host snapping this is amazingdespite most people thinking that secretive plotter is the author im gonna guess its dokja himself or at least a different version of him my reasoning the fact that the secretive plotter recommended a scenario and that dokja has said that he has recommended twsa to others is the reasoning weak yes but its there and weak enough for it to be a well crafted twist in my opinioni‚Äôm absolutely in love with this story shame on me for not finding this earlieri dont care how cruel i might sound right now but just kill them all already i cant stand this anymorei really cant hate bihyung if hes this cutemoral high ground umm excuse me but this is the apocalypse yes tell them dokja weary_facehonestly id be so fed up i wouldve snapped a lot earlier than dokja didas he should beat they asses dokja this is why everyone likes dokjaalthough tonka is acting a little evil he probably is trying to do this to somehow reason to the people and break hans incite skill and probably earn a incite skill himself furthermore he might himself ask the people to collectively kill hans and his henchmen which will make the people earn the required coins go kinghyeonsyeong is a big man child and i‚Äôm here for itagain hes so hotdokja is a really interesting character ambiguous gray characters are my favorite if portrayed correctly its their fault too hahai love dokja he‚Äôs not one of those ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù but he‚Äôs more interesting love an unhinged character more of him plsi love how dokja is keeping a balance between the ryt sense of morality and the manipulative aspects of the situation while on one end he is keeping his promise to get food and is doing as much as he can to keep the ones in charge from doing anything bad he isnt tolerating any kind of manipulation and taking his stand we stan loudly_crying_faceraising_handsyaasssjhdhhdhhdhdhdshshvnndndndnhf so satisfying im curious in the raw is gilyeong call dokja only by his name or he call dokja

nowconstellations smiledok smiles evilyme both but with laughterdokja do be having a cute butt doeand if i refuse on a tshirtchillshyeonseong cutiei like that it seems like dokja is becoming more like yu the longer the story goes ondream be like sharing is caring and i dont caredokja is maintaining the high moral ground as he said the first scenario was the original sin they all murdered someone to survive but have since been living on handouts failing to take responsibilities for their own lives after taking someone elses in his eyes they arent good people and have proven time and time again to be scummy or pathetic on top of being murders besides coins doesnt seem that hard to make with these mood constellations rolling_on_the_floor_laughing hell yes you dont owe these people anything they have the gull to take a life but not the balls to survive by their own accord i think he should just drop it all on han and let him use those coins he just goti love that dokja isnt the golden child and is morally gray like so happy for it its so much more realistic i really like this dude he is giving me serious life lessons atmyou need to make an anime out of this i havent got this worked up over a story in a whilepfft at least dokji and i have the same though it‚Äôs their fault for being so dependable they should also hunt their own foodsif i were him i‚Äôll be like ‚Äúi need to take care of myself for today tomorrow and so on‚Äù called me selfish if you want but it‚Äôs survival instinct why did i smile when dokja slice that man armskullslayy them alll hun esp tht bastard incho whtever tht iswelp time to kill them allface_without_mouthhe do be kinda scarycutie bihyeong is backkthe constellation of me is satisfied with your doingsmiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_closed_eyessmiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_closed_eyesmy guess is he‚Äôll help ppl who help him and leave ppl behind who wrong him but who knows idfk im getting major bi himbo vibes from hyunsung since the beginning yeah glad he finally snappedoh man i missed bihyeong like he‚Äôs so adorable i really appreciate the constellations comments lolso no ones gonna talk about how the giant insect beat the stone rhino in a fightok lets be reali mean why would he give the coins he earnedeven if he give how long they are gonna survive day day and to how many of them he can givethe only thing they will try to do is suck him until his coins get finished ofc becoz he looks easy among ones with high coinsinho or they may even kill himand then go to another thats how it workswhat a badasswonder what the constellations thought of that stop using your money on coins ii didi just think it‚Äôs funny and creative how they incorporated the constellations reaction to different situationsi dont know how the angel will react thoughhe attac backthe constellation the sleepy chaos is too lazy to interactcheon inho keeps getting on my nervesbro they didn‚Äôt risk their lives to stay alive why should he share with lazy cowardsi know this guy is tired i feel bad for all of them i mean probably all those people killed or let someone died in order to survive yes the good thing to do would be to share but why should he really i do think that moral is an important thing and kindness is a great value to have but you cant force other people to be kind nor righteous specially in a world like that and especially when theyll most surely turn their backs on him once he stop been useful i dont like many of his decisions but i understand themis it just me or is bihyeong looking more like the demonic child of monokuma and pikachuto be honest people probably thought there wouldnt be a survival fee so they mightve bought food with the rest of those coins so in a way he is kind of responsible for their deathyeah bihyoeong is back i thought they removed him bachade he made the contract but i guess not nice though hed be really cute if he wasnt such a sadistah a fellow antihero i see i really wanna find out who is the secretive plot constellation ook like um naofumi was like this the stupid princess lied got him in trouble and he became a good bad guy just like dokjakinda wish we could see his total coin count would k really break the banknoo don‚Äôt lose your mindhah plopbeautifuloooh that hurt woah dokja hejehehwbnehd so coolloudly_crying_facefood horder is pleased by dokjas actionsi mean he‚Äôs not wrong but he‚Äôs also not rightitd be funny if he sold out mr suit for his k coinsi jus noticed this but the art style is similar to unholy bloodthe entitlement really jumped outhyeonseong lee looks a bit like our voltron space dadabsolutely no onedokja the concept of what we know as what is good and what is bad left this world when this game started damn perfect response reminds me of those beggers in assassins creedthe way i smack my leg from that scene can be heard all the way to the next villagefr you wanted to live you cant take care of your selfthat old man is uselessinteresting ü§© i really want this to be a book so i can keep with me and i can recommend to others oh get over yourselffinally a realistic character me why would i give my coins to you too i just find it funny that the sound effect for dokja cutting of that mans hand is ploploudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_facei dont know why but i like the main character always teaching the person in wrong a lessonoop if he lost his finger did he loose his money xdoh he‚Äôs somewhat of an evil character evil in the way that he causes grief to those who care about himdokja i love youyay bihyeong is backi love how dokjas a morally grey character i completely agree with everything he did it makes sense cuz hes not obligated to anyone and he is kinda helpful to some people so yeahomniscient reader huge chicken legsits finger lickin goodi mean dokjas right theyre the ones who survived because they killed people and now they blame dokja for them not being able to survive because of the lack of coins so pathetic and what a hypocritedude was like no thanks hes backdamn dokja yes kinggg relieved_facehave i ever said how much i do love dokja confounded_facered_heart ahh and the story is barley beginning gosh damn someone pass me some chicken wings this is getting goodwould dokja count as a morally grey character thinking_faceoh finally this is what ive been looking for to an mcwell it is true if you can not survive on your own in that kind of world why would you still wanna live eyesshart getting realomg smilethose ppl deserve this they already commited sin in the first scenerio and now they r blaming dokja for this situation heck yea dokja made the ryt decisionwhy is everything going so smoothly people give the coins dokja why people kill that bastd dokja big mistake slash people sht readers yessthat was unexpected i thought dokja would defer the crowd to that han guy who has coinsi wonder where this will gohyeonseong lee has begun too simp on you face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyif he has the most coins that means he has the most fighting experience some people should know that instead they should bargain with himthere are people like them everywhere manipulated by others and just live following the flow they dont have any passion to pursue and go with the majority even i am like that sometimes this just gave me a smack on my head watch out junghyeok yu theres a new protagonist in townyaaasss dokja yaasswow dokja is really cool but why didn‚Äôt he throw that guy who killed him under the buson that last panel dojka got birthday_cakebirthday_cakebirthday_cakehahaha i like this f@ckng reader this type of character is what i want to see may the f@ckng creator make more characters like this hahaha f@ck you guys btwas marcus always says no refundsthis is true shit bro why you gotta be helpful and all that stuff selfishness is human nature but they bought the food with their coins earlier then they want a refund smham i sensing light yagami vibes right nowgive his food back if they want their coins i like dokjas neutral personlityeeeki felt bad for them up until he pointed out that they had to kill someone to get this far ok ok okaay be a bad bitch fine by mewhy do i remember shen qingqiu with the blue thingy heck yeshyeonseong lee is adorable with the way his

great for a moment there i thought i was reading solo leveling this webtoon is so good it reminds so much of solo leveling and i like how they dint copy solo leveling and made it their own thing every week i have to wait for a new chapter for solo leveling but now to wait i can read this this is probably my second favorite webtoon behind solo leveling i love this bookdokjas development is impressive his judgment based on logic and reasoning and him not letting anyone wear him down or manipulate himits a leader quality clapping_hands his eyes went from innocent at the start of the series to downright badass nownow he pulled it out and slammed it on the tabledokja is a true capitalistholy fricking moly i love this webtoon who else read the web novel im up to ch now smiling_face_with_sunglasses btw im bragging %did sangah notice what dokja was doing when he was trying to see her personal attribute im afraid of what will happen to his group now so far they have all trusted him because he has helped them out to some degree but after he cut off that guys arms and isnt helping anyone then maybe they will go against him too if they did how would that change things and how come he didnt out the other guy didnt he get a bunch of coins after taking the last blow of the monster dokja beatremember the name roecleanconstellation galiate is speechlessi want some of his wits also his ability to read the room and say no impresses me to an extreme levelthis manga is exactly my type sad thing is i cant buy coins cuz im broke cliffhangers are illegaldepending on others is not a bad thing but if they tell you to depend on them otherwise that would be cruel to them pensive_faceshits going down mananyone else thought dokja is doing hood rnthe constellation fangirl shipper is pleased with this developmentpeople giving all they got just to live another day hes a reader its understandablethe moment dokja drew his sword i heard megalovania begin to playdude that last scene was sooo bad asome people bout to get torn upi feel like hes a little too prepared for this world that right now hes not fully accepting what around him is real hes just doing what hed dream of doing for years while reading the story i think theres going to be a moment where he really reflects on his actions and maybe breaks down ngl sangah gave away her attribute and sponsor with this but since it‚Äôs major spoilers i‚Äôll refrain from saying anything wait bihyung was the one responsible for the item box jeez i‚Äôm on chapter and that‚Äôs still new info aww they‚Äôre all so happy and now they‚Äôre not i gotta say inho was clever but dokja was just two steps ahead heythe cursed guy got k coinsso once they realize that he‚Äôll be chased by the others xdlol dokja‚Äôs not just gonna give these people welfare they don‚Äôt deserve itwhat about the deamon killer with k coins wheres he at throw that btch under the buslook at the flick of that wristskullhe looks so

if i was dokja bitch do i look as if i caredidn‚Äôt what‚Äôs his face sell them food toome reading all the episodes times wiating for the next oneplop plop the dudes arm got chopped choppedi love dokja‚Äôs character he‚Äôs not going to be the main character that always wants to do the right thing even when it could cost him his life he‚Äôs more logical and i think that‚Äôs gonna make the story a lot more interestingthe next week well see a lot of blood and i cant waitthing is he still kinda is maintaining the moral high ground who knows what these people did in the initial scenario on top of many already having shown to be straight up bad guys particularly those led by the gang leader dude so not only is it not a stretch to assume these people arent as innocent as they seem but its also very likely that they werent lucky and killed some bugs like dokjas group did which considering what dokjas thoughts have been this is exactly what hes thinkingthe man snapped lmaogod dayum double cheeked up weary_faceflushed_facedokja showing them what‚Äôs upbesides that guys hands hes so hotjust walk to him poke poke poke with that iron thingy and coins rewarded from the neet godthat was one hell of a turnthe way my voice cracked when i screamed hell yedokja made it clear that hes not messing around why would anyone take him as a push overoh theres gonna be one for female

bishesrolling_on_the_floor_laughing something had to snap eventually he was petering on the edge of this from day onei have to wait days for the free episodenooo i neeed moreit would be cool if dokja ends up being the antagonist and the protagonist remains the same he did say the regressor lost his humanity after regressing times maybe dokja will lose his over time given how strong he is itll be interesting to see how characters like sangah can beat his fourth wall ability especially since he has no character profile on her it is possible to beat dokja since gilyeong already has an idea of what dokja is capable ofif im remembering this correctly isnt the cost of a human life coins so if he killed half of them probably the ones trying to kill him then he could save the other halfi feel like dokjas alignment would be neutral because he seems to fit into a morrelly grey area seeing as he isnt evil but then he also isnt good either its really cool to see characters such as dokja who dont stick to morals but still arnt evil i‚Äôm in love with this webtoonhe got you the food twice you expect him to help you when you didn do shidemon like judge of fire best constellationdokja done

to being the gold coin of the people and that is great because it is proof that u owe nothing to no one and u are not entitled to them and honestly i wouldnt share coins either if i were in the place of dokja cuz he worked hard and killed beasts to earn those coins and they think just by threatening him they will get coins hell naw get off ur asses and go do something useful for once lmaoodayum

ground to give them coins i wouldn‚Äôt say that decision is morally not good at all obviously it‚Äôs isn‚Äôt the bad thing but like jdjeh yeits true it does look pathetic to blame dokja like its their fault for not go hunting for the mf coins dokja is such a cool character i love characters like himglad the survival fee only exists in the story otherwise i‚Äôd be dead right now smiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_cold_sweatface_with_tears_of_joy i have zero coins on webtoon & it‚Äôs right nowfuckemim here just hoping that gilyeong and others in the group wont get scared or distrustful of dokja because of this or telling him that he should help them those people dont deserve it and dokja is % right with taking that approach even if he helped them theyd never pay backi really love this webtoon so freaking satisfying omg im in lovesmiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyesunlike other male leads his plots are different and

him x hotter ü•µthats my baby loving how closely this follows the novel glad to be able to see the characters ive only read about drawn out and coming to life this toon makes my wednesdays betterwe

be here tmmrloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceit‚Äôs the apocalypse at a certain point it‚Äôs everyone for themselves person_shrugging‚Äçfemale_signÔ∏èjust a reminder to all the people who want him to share because its the right thing to do all of these people begging for coins are murderers and its not like hes obligated to help them either just because he is the main charactermy man dojka is going for that chaotic neutralevil routesavage dokja i admit it i am bored of all good and soft main leads i want something worth and here comes dokja the savage king actually in real life everyone is selfishblood for the blood godeveryones coming up with big brain comments and im here like lol dokjas hoti love this sword it makes me feel like im welding a idk justsomething good ya knowdaamn that was sickkill them alli hadnt thought of the first scenario like that they all killed someone else to be here and thus nullifies any reason to even attempt for a moral high ground most of dokjas group killed insects and remains for the time being non murderers very interestingits easy to say this cause its a fictional story but not everyone was gonna survive anyway why not just get rid of the pricks and assholes like thisthe decision he take might be seem wrong but tbh if i was at his place i would do the same thing i guessyeah cut their asses thats mah boyi would have had them compete for the coins like top five get a loan for the survival fee and maybe i‚Äôll let them join me or fight for me later to pay it back their debt pahahahahaha i love psycho dokja hahahahahais there no one mention about how gilyoungee calling dokja in the novel he call dokja hyung since he is younger than dokja maybe its better to change how gilyoungee call dokja in the next episodethey fucked up they fxcked up they fxcked up my mans went off not like they can cancel himi like the scans translation of the last scene more it was more epic and cool which got me excited for the next chapters this mess youre all in do you really think its my fault goosebumps all over my body after that linefinally im sick of these people who just wait for help and do nothing that inho cheon too his character is disgusting people like him never admit their mistakes and push the blame onto others all the time while making it seem that theyre a saint despicable i agree with dokja those people are being pretty selfish even though they want to survive they cant be aggressive and start asking for a refund of what they already ate sotoo late people skullooh its starting to get interesting teehee smiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_closed_eyessmiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_closed_eyesaye yoi screamed out loud when he cut his arms off he‚Äôs serious imagine you attack someone and they whip out a sword and chops your hands off ah a normal dayyes suddenly the apocalypse is turning into a double apocalypse he can‚Äôt give all these people coins everyday just to survive dokja has no real obligation to these people they never saved his life he only profited off of them and the only people he really has ties to is the people in his party so i stand by his decisionbihyeong is backloudly_crying_facered_heartÔ∏èoofhe does have a point everyone there is likely a murder and the people who tell him to be a good person are the worst ones well they are the one who demand food and now they are putting the blame on dokjawow such a pathetic humansconfused_facei want to see the thug leadee diesmirking_facei want to see the thug leadee diesmirking_facehe gonna kill that blonde and when he does i‚Äôll be laughingwell he did nothing wrong everyone who managed to make it here killed somebody but did not have the guts to carryon and earn their living so no one has any obligation to meet their demands if he lets them survive now by giving in they will only die next round because they are incapable of surviving on their own thats a wasted investment okay that went from to real quicki highly doubt dokja is gonna let the random kids die if he does then the support of his allies goes down the gutter and most the constellations gonna hate himi love this series the constellation dania twilight is laughing her teeth off due to the evil face of the incarnation dokja kim the constellation dania twilight is too broke to gift you coins coins please i just need coins to buy the next episodeugh i love main characters like this bc the plot is so interestingdokja i getchu bud thats the exact reason why i dont like to play a hero every person will ask u about ur morals i have read this novel til the end just incase you know survival of the fittest bitchesdokja looks more handsome when hes being mean are interested to see your moves to me dokja seems like a good guy but instead of giving handouts he‚Äôs teaching others to be responsible for their actions and in his own ways helps his friends enjoy this type of kim dokja while you still can this man is going to throw handsboi this world is twisted now and days so survival is the way to go not that i percent agree with dokja but still i love the twistsy e swhere did those huge drumsticks go ü•∫we get dokja is a badass and the other people are idiots but is no one going to talk about hyeonseong lee and his sheild its so sparklyhehe im excited to see everything illustrated i recently picked up the novel and am on chapter things haven gotten extremely interesting i recommend giving the novel a try if you ever have spare time ^^badassthis is funholy shitscary but real fing cooldamm hes neutral i dont know why people mad he cant look after others with no disregard to his own life in my opinion people should never be blamed for doing what they need to do to survivei love dokjas character aint like some typical protagonist with golden heartthis is a prime example of a good protagonistyeah bitches stop free loadingtheres a lady with a little boy i hope he does share some coins with them though vg is fascinated by your story and is waiting for new episodes he have no coins vis it me or dokjas really hot with that swordjust like the people in this current chapter i need coinslove it novel plot is really good and now the drawings i dont deserve this one bitcharacters like dokja are my favorite everyone its his faultdokja lemme tell you somethinlemme tell you somethinremeber communism works in theory but when put into practice it fails horribly everyone at the shelter should know thatuno reversed that green shirts threatooh~ dokja is so tenseyes boy ask for some respect if i may her skill reminds me of hisokas bungee gumskullunbroken faith in action looks absolutely stunninghe is taking a very interesting route had it been me i would have also refused to disclose little to any information as well fearing that it would cost my life however im kind of concerned to his development as an individual because in the beginning he was shy and seemed nice enough now he has become nearly similar to the regressor and its quite hard to hd anything against him when any other person in his shoes wouldve done the same bihyeong i missed yougreat chapter dokjas character is super interesting im very excited to see how this scenario endsbut i‚Äôm just a kidloudly_crying_faceif i was grown and had lots of mobey i would turn this into animedokja is soo cooli rate it lowkey the big ego dudes fault cause he built a community that became like thati know that the crowd of people are heavy hypocrites but i really cant blame them theyre just trying to survive by buying food and asking for help from people who can help them its just a survival instinct and also imagine if you were in that situation you dont have powerful friends maybe youre not very good you dont have a good constellation and youre broke most importantly youre not the main characterprotagonist in the story at all so you have to live its just pitifuli love it this character us going closer to the chaotic neutral side but sticks firmly in true neutral this way in terms of dnd allinment checks he could instantly alter his actions to output a spicific looking outcome like he looks true chaotic evil then maybe if your pushing it episodes later he is neutralhe need to get to the alignment slowly and slowly he looks like the ideal lawful good protagonist instead he is a neutral character who is on for the ridecant wait for kim dokja whipping those bastard assesomg getting these updates is always one of the highlights of my studyfilled week im really interested to see how dokja turns out i love the direction its going in right nowyeess we love a morally grey characterjudgment time kim dokja is awesome xdonline schoolhome work can wait the childs life is more important must

the sake of somebody elsepeople erase my foolish decisions and give me coins again so i dont suffer my own consequences dokja no red_heartÔ∏èsmiling_faceÔ∏èdaggerÔ∏èdaggerÔ∏ècant he just finish the

thing cute‚Äúoh his arm got cut off huh‚Äùdokja you lit flexed_bicepshe didnt have does kinds of morals he just didnt want to stand out but was forced to do so by a jackass with the power to manipulate the masses i‚Äôd kill someone for more coins to read ahead in this webtoon neutral_facei really want this to be turned into an anime it would be so good viva la revolutionbut it kinda made sense all those people survived because they killed someone and now that they can‚Äôt even manage to survive on their ownyou prick that t man is soo pathetic i cant stand ityou know what i like about dokja hes not like your usual mc who wants to save everyone who doesnt want anyone to die who wants to be the hero hes not really sympathetic and he sees things as they are eg these people were shit to me before so why should i help them do they deserve my help he wants to do whats best for him just like they all do except that hes not leaching off of others hes doing it himself i really respect him as a character for thatsome of you will die but that is a sacrifice i‚Äôm willing to make he looked like a badass at the end just like a villain and i absolutely love itsparkling_hearti am so hyped for next episoderealistically speaking most of these people are going to die anyway maybe not today or even tomorrow but they wont last with the monsters as a whole most people are weak they look for easy ways out and for others to do for them giving the money back or paying their way for more day only prolongs the inevitable and leaves you with even more people begging tomorrow this decision had to be made sooner or later this series is so amazing i‚Äôm so excited every tuesday after a hard day at work to read thiscounter offer nodokja you bastard that was too badassu go dokja i missed you dokkaebi if that was the spelling loldang dokja is ice coldinsert evil giggle if words dont work they bout to talk to these sparkleshandssparkleswhat a badass protagonistwill i get killed

slayythat one guy who has over coins be like $$$see this is what im saying omniscience has a cost and that cost is that every interaction you have down to the smallest level is an equation you just need to solve for the best possible outcome and it doesnt matter what that takes or gains because its deffinitionally best its basically blue orange moralitytbh i dont like the heartlessness but at the same time i know damn well id do the same thing honestly its hard to judge this situation bc he doesnt know if everyone there actually killed someonesome couldve had the same idea with the bugs but at the same time its most likely they didi love his character right nowhyeonseong omgconfounded_faceconfounded_facesparkling_heartthe leader of the major group is so manipulative i dont think any of the about to die characters tried it but if they had some coins left just not enough for the survival fee i might have been tempted to negociate with dokja to an exchange in order to die with a full belly like the last smoke but instead a last steaki know they probably have to do that but i laugh every time i see the notice of depictions of violence like you should have written that into the manga description its in almost every chaptersmiling_face_with_open_mouth_&_cold_sweatgod damncrossed_fingerscrossed_fingersblushin like a maniac rn ü§≠ü§≠what kind of dummy rushes someone with a sword personally‚Ä¶ who even cares bout these people they‚Äôre bloodthirsty as soon as things turn sour and they can‚Äôt see that the obviously evil leader is in the wrong here unamused_faceedit and if you want to survive in an apocalypse situation like this you have to figure out a way to survive being a mindless background groupthinker is a surefire way to die ingenuity is the way to goha people with no moral tryna be moral loli really like how dokja doesnt try to compromise with everything in his way pretty refreshing tbhi think this would happen when something like this happen those people should start taking responsibility for their own after killing people from st round damnn that was so damn good so satisfying weary_faceweary_faceyes dokja slay slay those bitchesyes good choice dokjaslay dokjai really like the constellations they seem extremely cool especially the prisonerim happy he did that hyeonseongs reaction to the shield is pricelessahhh this feels so much better im tired of those characters who try to stay at societys standards you go dokjayay morally grey characters are my favoriteyeah kindai love that he is not niceamazing story and art please support the authortranslatori agree with dokja theyre in a position where they have it make an effort to survive and its the law of the chain strong and weak ones and he doesnt have to share his coins that he collect with his and team effort also you share once and theyll keep coming all the time cause they want the easy wayso agree totally with dokja hes not wrong or baddeserve so muchyesss ugh that was satisfyingslice oh your arm hit my blade congrats youve lost a couple of pounds loseryou seem confused you dont have power over him because he cant kill every single one of you you had power over him because he didnt want to that white thing are cute lol yet scaryso should i just ignore that there was no comments for the past few chapterswhats so bad becoming a villainoh yeah things are starting to get interestingbihyeong is taking me out loudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_facedokjas character is interesting than most protagonists ive ever seenwait hold on arent we the readers the constellations in this casehe unlocked the rinnesharingan thats all i gotta sayhan myungoh had around thoque delicia finalmente um enche lingui√ßa dessa apanhando morality doesn‚Äôt even exist in this world anymore it all depends on the person‚Äôs values and dokja‚Äôs got pretty unpredictable values im sure he cares about the people he considers his team now and he even saved huiwon without expecting to gain anything in return which is odd cause he‚Äôs been doing things for his own benefit he also lied to gilyeong so he‚Äôd still have some hopeoptimismgod im loving dokjaman i love this but it makes sense since his whole thing is like im not the protagonist so why should i be a herogileyeong has a power to communicate with animals how cooolhe is soü§ålight_skin_tonethe constellation

its communismat first i disagree with dokjas actions but in second thought i realized he was really just fending for himself while it seemed like dokja swindled coins from the crowd knowing that the food he sold would vanish anyway and thus decreasing their chances of survival he only did it because the pressure was placed unto him plus he really didnt anticipate that survival fee so the incited mob were just reaping the consequences of their gullibility in letting themselves be manipulatedthe constellation ybahmedd laughs at the despair of those who tried to kill dokjayasssi genuinely love

really awesome byebye armsomg omgdokja is developing moral is a creation of the previous world in this world moral dont existoh damn o he got unarmed omgkirito ngh dokjaam i the only one who thinks hes hotü•µi love dokja‚Äôs character smoh god hes so hothdjdjfwhjsthcdamnlike you should only get help if you deserve that if not dont make moral excuse rightwhy there is no music im literally being so loud right now just rooting for himanti heroi just hope the others dont lose trust in him for this because hes not even in the wrong tbhbro why tf is he built like the mc from tomb raider king all the characters have a really big similaritytjats my boynice dokjatbh im agree with dokja rolling_on_the_floor_laughingdokja is my unbothered king idk i think he is weeding out the evil people to help the good ones i think morally he does have the high ground on thisi am so curious at to the type of person dokja ishe isn‚Äôt a hero and not a villian eitherwell i meannn itll just be a nuisance if this type of people actually surviveskraaazythese people knew what was coming and if they have other people like kids or elderly to pay for as well hold off on food for a day if needed do something anything to get them that doesnt involve waiting til the last minute and going mental on this guy that worked hard for his im so glad he didnt back down or cave in to this worthless leaders gamesplop went his handgooddd my manpeople really get crazy when they are about to die why did they come back aywaysyes yes its starting to be interesting i love dokjathese idiots why did i laugh tho whats wrong with mewhy should he give them his coins they are just going to die soon i doubt they‚Äôll even make it the next payment point that‚Äôs a complete waste that‚Äôs not being a villain that‚Äôs just being smart do what you have to to survive i love how our mc is moral or immoral depending on the situation its refreshing that hes not % moral or % immoral dokja is really out here explaining the theme ‚Äúsharing is not caring‚Äùthe goon squad was so ready to attack pathetic scum he aint rich for nothing face_with_tears_of_joydokja worked very hard to get the coins and the weapons he worked very hard to level up to survive so what right do those people who have done nothing but living on other people‚Äôs efforts just like a parasites have to ask him to give them coinshes just surviving with a reason guys no need to be so poopy i completely agree with this decision because as shitty as it is this is the reality of this world and he knows that things cant go back to normal and if theres a wish that can then if they die at this point it wont matter so rather increase his chances as much as possible right now and keep as many coins to himself as possible because if they have to depend on him to get coins they wont survive in the future eitheryes finally hes not dumb and trying to act like a hero like other mc in every storyiesamen to that you made your bed so lie in itunamused_facewowdokkaebi looking cute rnone pair of hand is gone pair moreyou are special you are loved black swordsman oo this mans looks like nothing but a main character bruhspoiler warning

said id spent all my coins on the sweet new sword sorry not sorrycool theres no mercy for dishonest gangsters give us back our coins give me back my foodhonestly the people got that far by killing at the very least they could try to complete the scenarios although people in crisis rarely think rationally especially with that shit startertiny bihyeong  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ îhis legs were cut off his arms

yesshehehehe gold diggersthis is so excitingthats how you play with these mfspls kid dont think bad about him you are sharp you know that is not his fult rightinsanity its kinda like letting a murder off his or hers sentence you wouldnt do that so why would he have to help them when they have nothing useful for him agree with his pov can somebody clarify if the completion of scenarios accects every member of the group or just who is fulfilling the requirementsi would‚Äôve have said ‚Äúwhat do i get for‚Äù or ‚Äúprove your worth‚Äù because these guys are just desperate anywayi would have paid them off in order to recruit an army to deal with inho with people dependent on dokja for food and then their very lives he could easily seize control of the station but i suppose power isnt his goalnot a single coin spent herewowowowowowi‚Äôm glad they are finally fighting those bastards constellation water sound and wind sound wanna see biyu asapgilyeong is so cute omghell yeah dokja go

‚àÜdif i were him i would only help the people who were close with me and part of my group the women the boy and the other mani like this side of dokja i think dokja will end up as an antivillain or an antihero as we can see here he is still a good guy but has some evil qualities by not sharing his coins though i do agree with his decisionmeanwhile ima take a guess as to who sangahs constellation is httpsenwikipediaorgwikiariadne and dont tell me if im righti know hes seems like hes turing to a villain but i bet this is something hes doing just to scare them he really doesnt want to be the bad

chapterü•∫evil mc boi this is so funny rolling_on_the_floor_laughingyeah think the man could spare us some coinsthere wasn‚Äôt any point in sharing coins the situation would repeat once and again and in the end people would still die and he‚Äôd be in an unfavourable situation with little to no coins he is not assessing the situation morally but practically in the long run he cannot really help themyuh dokja just snappedwelp natural selection bishes morals wont save you rn and thats how that man became withered chicagrinning_face_with_smiling_eyesactually i liked dokjas decision as all the people there didnt had any morals right now & they are just burdens with selfish motivesits apocalypse do i have time to be nice i dont think sogod im so glad dokja isnt some kind of a saint too naive to just give coins to those people thats the reality you gotta knock or even slice some arms to give sense to some people loli love dis me whenever someone wants me to share my food because they think

dokjadamn this webtoon is gold keep up the good work manthis is soo my favorite webtoon i love the storyline along with characters and the drawing stylewhat a badasshis plan is to break the control of that influencer he is truly a terrifying villain he has to take him out before he levels up morewhy does this feel like fallout soo much dat buttshit i wanna sword like thatme reading episode on seriesalso me wow i like thems artsanyone say antihero because i thought i heard antihero lmaotell em dokjai thought dokja was just going to say myeonghan has coins to spare so he doesnt become the villain and doesnt lose coinsyou tell em dokjai didnt think this would be so good during the first few chapters im glad i didnt drop itwoeiooww theses people i want to fucking straggle themwow so much thought was put into this webcomicoooh this is getting excitingbihyung why you look so cutesneezing_facesneezing_faceguys be ready for the unpredictable scammer kim dojegai love they changed the

attack the other dudehe looks scaryi like itohohoh some gonna die tonightthis is badhow can they just say that likethey should try to prove thier worth instead of trying to kill him like how dumb are youhe have more coins because of some reason peoplehes right though why should he give them coins also if he did the next time the fee shows up they are going to rely on him to give them coins then it turns into a cycle which might end him with no coinsi like the fact that the others are still behind him obviously positioned to protect himfireyesss use logic not moralitygod damn this boy has some principles and im excited to see them like of course u ugly dead meats why would he do that hes not ur legal guardian or anything square the fk upi called there was gonna be a giant mantis i knew itthis is amazing dokja is awesome i always love a badass character damn fearful_faceface_screaming_in_fearmy jaw lower than my short a of yess hes backwait wait wait wait wait he can essentially borrow skills right what if he borrows incite to turn everyone against the guy who was sending people out in the first placethis story isn‚Äôt exactly one of my favorites rn but it just gets more and

himself the only sacrifice while everyone else can survive damndaamn i love him slay bich slay them allwhat i think he should do is give them coins but only if they give him the survival reward so they all live gain respect for dokja and he also gets his coins backman even tho bihyeong is kinda a ass he gets better on in later scenesfinally a character who is looking out for themselves before other people it‚Äôs refreshing bihyeongthank god i was praying that he didn‚Äôt give the coinskinda reminds me of this situationkids at lunch buy lunch food even thought they sat its badthese guys bought food with their coins both of them still gobble that shit up fast ngl i would do the sameyes i have been waiting for this and im loving it inho sharing is caring dojka shut the fck updat ass i

this mc he has a bit of sociopathic behavior but he can still function he has the so called onoff switch with realistical adaptable human thinking and moral reasoning if neededoh no hes very pissed offim here and i regret nothingthe constellation hanae_saku liked dokja a lot coins have been awarded i used the free coins earned for an event because i want to support the artist i hope to read moregosh dangit i want more i just fast forward using all my coins and i dont regretno one is good they wanto still moneyi cant wait for more updates ü§©ü§©ü§©im all about the daily uploads i will gladly spend my money for this webtoonbut from what i read this guy is pretty much the line and does who desire to disrupt that line is considered an annoyance i for one respect that is there a new chapter every dayman i really hate praying mantis even as it isinlove yeess we needed this dokja doesnt deserve to take smack from anyone show em whos boss imagine spending all of your weeks worth of lunch money for coins without your parents knowledge i think i messed upi dont remember what the little demon is thats controlling the game but i like the guy i know hes demonic and all but i still like himi like him as a character not the other wayfirst time reader opinions i think dokja is about to learn a new bookmark skill but what would happen if two incite skills clashed interesting to see indeedlove this omgf u f them what makes me the enemy love this twist and realismour protagonist is such a badass i love his reasoning and how he can be so cold sometimesi think im going to reread this webtoon from the very beginning its just so very goodi feel bad at how easily they are corrupted always a great read im definitely hoping you an get funding for a tv showcant stress the notouch policy enough these daysgotta love characters that do what they need to survive and don‚Äôt puss up at every turngetting super tasty lemme see tha da next clup pleaze kind sirwell if theyd actually work harder they would have coins like dokja said they killed someone to stay and why should this be his problem go boy chop chopthe constellation greedy storyarc devourer alpha thinksdikja should buy the peoples loyalty if they want coins he should get something in return the constellation greedy storyarc devourer alpha thinks dokja should go ahead and kill that dudeis this still going to update daily this mights just be me but im begging you to keep it that waywow thats cool the blooded dont dokija but it is the bosses followed because hes just being a prickthis sword is so epicbased neutral oh i love dokjathe crowd is about to turn on the people who sold the food for triple the amount im glad dokja isnt a pussy idiot mcyes dokja god i love dokja this was amazing im thrilled i love thiss story now that is what i call chaotic good smiling_face_with_hornsset the tone dok clear out the useless extras and then get onto the villainsyes dokja defend yourselfsheesh dude aint playin no games with yallthe dude in the red at the end looks like he shat himselfomg this man just went sicko mode so beautiful there deadyoobeautiful so god damn beautiful damn bro dokja turning hella sick nowi really love how many twist and turns this story takes but when dokja goes cold face he says f those twist and turns ones desire to live should never delve to the depths of unnecessary violence applaud the player for their insight and not blame their ability to do well when others flounderidk what webtoon i love more this or the gamertake my money but in a serious note who can blame him or the people it‚Äôs about to go down eyesi greatly approve of dokja our mc right now i mean he still has the moral high ground most of those people are there because they killed someone and still refuse to be responsible for their own lives or actions why should he help them it would actually be pointless since they wouldnt learn anything morally the right action is to let them suffer the consequences for their choices so that if they survive maybe theyll change on their owni would like a psycho mc hehe am getting tired of the good and cringey onesim so glad dokja doesnt have the saviour complex that most mcs tend to have dthiss i mean i dont like the character who always been taken advantage by others i love how he isnt a very morally goody shoeshes like its an apocalypse frick u toomy

a villain is far better than being a hero smirking_facesmirking_facewoa some people in these comments genuinely scare me where is your humanity why are so many people so happy the mc might not be a good guy when did being a good person become boring if this was a real scenario and you genuinely wouldnt help people when you could at least the children in this crowd then idk what to say but you need to think about what kind of person you are damn papi you a rare breedhah this is why i absolutely love coldquiet people they al always have an interesting instinct being a villain is better than hero in my perspectiveever protagonists says ‚Äúhow pathetic‚Äù in a scary way with there pupil dilated i dont think i have ever loved a mc more than i love him i truly hate self righteous mcsat first i was like mhmm ‚Äúmen with swords‚Äù as a joke but bro i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a joke anymore tired_facelove how he reacted this webtoon is amazing through all but the mc makes it times better the world they live in is twisted i know but the mc is right for many reasons im seriously going to start crushing on himdokja reminds me of khun from tower of godi love that it‚Äôs not your typical righteous protagonist give me some realityidk about anyone else but i was like finally my godddgreatt character development so realistic and not idealistic tbh i would prob do the same being a good person is cool now but in a situation like that it‚Äôs jst being weak it‚Äôs jst letting others manipulate u for personal gain at that point i would sorta jst be like ‚Äúfuck it‚Äùyes finally a character whos not a bitch this is why i loved solo levelingfinally he is all out of mercynice i like that they are just evilhe has every right not to give them coins they killed ppl he can use that as an excuse if he doesn‚Äôt wanna seem evil cuz he killed bugsi think children at least deserve your help but at the end its a survival of the fittest scenario not a charitymost of the people there killed other people to survive so why should he give coinsi like the way dojka just helps people that actually does need it and i honestly love the way he is not stick on being the good ass guy but instead a fair one literally loving itdokja doesnt take shit and i love it so much pathetic humansused all their coins and blame someone else for their stupidity trash deserves to be destroyedits the apocalypse my dudes ahhi stand by dokjahe is doing the right thing i dont see these people doing anything to live other than just surviving theres a big difference they took human life to get where they are now coins each thats more nights of life or instead of squatting they could you know work on the scenarios at hand face_with_rolling_eyes dokja is taking the moral high

dokja smiling_face_with_heart-eyesü•∞face_blowing_a_kiss especially like thisdrooling_face lazy people who arent taking selfaccountability into consideration for their own lives and actions should not live off others pouting_facewhat is this procapitalism trash i‚Äôm all about mercy and kindness but i would reacted the same way how dare you use me as a escape goat for your plan how dare you blame me for the fact you chose to stay in the station how dare you try to kill me for trying to keep you from another‚Äôs clutches gotta show some fear to be respected sometimes needy people sharing is caring me im not a care bear purple_heartim personally just annoyed of the finally protagonist that does something morally questionable as if every protagonist of these types of stories werent some sort of anti heroes who everytime they do something morally righteous they are like nah nah im doing this definitely for selfish reasonslike not crapping on peoples tastes here im just confused if they really dont realize that majority of web novel series have similar protagonists to here or make choice seem less edgy lateri dont disagree with dokjas choice but couldnt he have said that mr han has more momey than him even if its a liethinking_facei hate how the main character is slowly turning into a psycho i really pains methis is a lesson on why socialism is doodoogee ive never had top comment trump is like the dokkaebi making rules that cost lives lots of people will dieso wait if he lets everyone have a bite of the food wouldnt that complete the scenario for everyone so they wouldnt all lose coins unless im missing a stepi really appreciate that hes not willing to get pushed around thoughhe is kind of a bitch dont like him for looking down on those people just because he got lucky and happend to read the right story he wouldve been on their place if he didnt well no actually he would be dead from that edgeguy from the train i dont mean he should give his money to everyone but at least dont be a brat thinking they all deserved that maybe they killed insects too who knowshes lee gilyeong not gilyeong lee why you do this its korean webcomic why the names are

all this chapters dont waste your money on this webtoon theres a website that you can read for free now there are over chapters in the website so dont waste your money there are other platforms that has episode and it free grimacing_faceslightly_smiling_faceim staying cause theres a slim chance of hope but this is total garb_ age i mean come on just kill the sk m already & those r_ tards as well gods sakedojka seems kind of hypocritical to me he helps out only the people he knows he even helps that little boy but when there is another child that needs coins to survive he turns a blind eye i get not giving coins to the other people but at least for childrenthe thing is that author intentionally made those plain people become evil and start blaming him so he can keep looking down on them but not all are like that and in real life there would probably be more people just crying or begging then stratight attacking him so i find him a total bitch for being that arrogant he couldve done something for example really share coins with the rest who didnt attack him it wouldnt be much at all and he would probaby get even more as donation for his deedhe couldve killed the major group and gave their coins to those in need totally so fck this mc hypocrite or he coudlve at least tried to do smth maybe he will in next chapter but i doubtcharacter i have black hair commenter his hair is black whiner omg how dare you spoil it do you all realize how ridiculous you sound when you whine about spoiling have none of you ever read a book ex harry potter then find out it gets made into a movie and be excited for it anyways even though you already know everything that happens from beginning to end like seriously spoilers dont actually spoil anything you still enjoy the the cartoonmovie get the hell over yourselvesplease don‚Äôt speak in absolutes i don‚Äôt think the story progressed far enough you‚Äôve given us yoo the main protagonist given broken faith a buff then gave it to the reader and you giving the a powerful judge power to jung slow down and progress the story it will just become a story of absolutes and we don‚Äôt even know his goals or what striving for this will just be like a meaningless power fantasy in sea of trash power fantasies\n"
